The Earth has many mysteries, or things that are not known or explained. People use science to try to understand those mysteries.
The pyramids are giant tombs, or graves, for Egyptian kings. Pyramids are made of huge stone blocks. Experts know that the Egyptians didn't have the same tools that we have today. So, how were those heavy blocks moved and lifted? Some experts believe that the Egyptians pushed and pulled them into place.
1. Workers cut and shaped the stone into blocks.
2. The workers floated the blocks down the Nile River on big barges.
3. The workers rolled the blocks over logs from the river to the pyramid.
4. The workers built dirt ramps so the blocks could be rolled to the top of the pyramid.

229,"The map shows some volcanoes located in Mexico.
Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.
Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that
, or melted rock, was rising inside the volcano.
During eruptions, magma can spill out of openings in volcanoes. The hot, flowing magma is called
when it is outside the volcano. When Popo erupted, only heat, gas, and ashes burst out.
After the eruption, the residents were able to return to their homes. But they are watching for future eruptions.
Lava and ash from volcanoes can harm people. What else might these substances harm?
Popo is almost 18,000 feet high. Last Year's eruption was its biggest in 1,200 years.
About 550 volcanoes have erupted on Earth's surface since people began recording history.
A volcano erupts somewhere on Earth about once a week. Not all eruptions are big, however.
Other planets besides Earth have volcanoes. Mars, Venus, and Mercury have volcanoes.

What was it like talking to Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore?
Very surprising. George W. Bush said his daughters weren't so happy with him running in the election because they didn't want to leave their school or stay inside all the time. When I first went to speak to Al Gore in New Hampshire, he knelt down in the snow. It was sort of like he understood children. They both seemed like very nice men.

Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

465,"Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher.
Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.
You can learn more about UNICEF and what you can do to help kids in other countries at UNICEF's Web site

Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!

Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.

Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.

602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.

The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.

Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.

Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on).

Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming
or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.
""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told

Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns

Organizers expect millions of visitors to pour into the citys parks this year. There, they will see hundreds of snow sculptures and some huge buildings made with bricks of ice.
Harbin is the coldest city in China. The temperature in the city is below freezing for more than six months of the year. (The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.) In Harbin, the temperature can fall below zero. That gives people there a great
or chance, to build with tons of snow and ice. In fact, they use enough snow and ice to fill 90 large swimming pools!
In December, 3,000 workers began creating the winter amusement park. They carved giant castles, friendly dragons, slippery slides, and even working restaurants out of ice. Some of the buildings and sculptures have colorful lights that are lit up at night.
Many of the ice sculptures are made by teams of artists from around the world. When visitors come to look at the creations, they have to watch their step. Not only are the buildings made of ice, but so are many of the walkways and railings!
The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past.

Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study.

Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.

Researchers from England say that people may actually be able to scale walls and climb ceilings with gloves made of a special material. However, the researchers who came up with the material didn't get the idea from wall-crawling spiders.
Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
. Geckos are little lizards that use their sticky feet to cling to walls and ceilings. They can climb the most slippery glass surfaces and dangle from the ceiling with a single toe.
What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling.
""If human palms were covered by this [sticky] material, it would support the weight of an average human,"" said one scientist.
Scientists hope the material can be used with robots or in medicine. But they have a way to go before turning their idea into reality. The material is expensive, and it quickly loses its stickiness. Spider-Man would not be pleased to hear that!

to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and

Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces.
To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.
Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building.
Four presidents were carved into Mount Rushmore because they symbolized courage and freedom during the first 150 years of American history.
(1732-1799), the first U.S. president, led the American colonies to freedom during the Revolutionary War (1775-1783)
(1743-1826), the third president, helped write the Declaration of Independence.
(1809-1865), the 16th president, held office during the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) between the North and South.
(1858-1919), the 26th president, was a champion of the environment. He founded the first national parkYellowstone.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used this control room when the United States first sent humans to the moon. The room also served as the center for dozens of other space missions.
""This room was used from the Gemini missions all the way through to the space shuttle in the early 1990s,"" said NASA's Gary Kitmacher, my guide.
The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon.
My tour brought back many memories. I remember watching Neil Armstrong take ""one giant leap for mankind"" on my parent's television. In 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon.
A year later, I was glued to the television again. This time, scientists in this very room were trying to figure out how to get the astronauts of Apollo 13 back home when an oxygen tank exploded aboard their craft.
In the same building as the old Mission Control room is the new Mission Control room. Here, scientists keep tabs on the International Space Station (ISS) that orbits above Earth.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of walking on the moon. Walk-ing through Johnson Space Center--some 30 years later--is the next best thing.
The Saturn V rocket used to launch astronauts to the moon is located outside Johnson Space Center in Houston.
In 1965, the Gemini 7 spacecraft makes its historic mission.
Sixteen countries, including the United States, are building the International Space Station.

Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.

The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

722,"Educators spread the word about slavery in the North.
Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828. In 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She traveled throughout New England and the Midwest, speaking publicly against slavery and in favor of womens rights.

The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

52,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

18,"What is one of your worst nightmares about the school day? No recess!
For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.
Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or
, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.
The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.
One fifth grader in Virginia told the
she looks forward to the daily break so she can return fresh to her schoolwork. ""I feel like I'm ready for anything that comes my way,"" she said.

, which means people can develop a need for them that is very hard to get rid of. However, until recently, no studies had measured how addictive.
Cigarettes contain many chemicals, including a chemical called nicotine, which studies have proved is addictive.
For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks.
The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction.

Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told

684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?

Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.

The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of

Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.

2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.

31,"visits India and finds hope after tragedy
A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

Each year, the Great Insect Fair is held in State College, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people attend the fair to look at bugs, touch bugs, and even eat bugs.
Dorothy Blair is a nutrition expert. She says the fair teaches visitors that insects are an important source of food for people in some other countries.
Visitors to the fair can munch on stir-fried mealworms, cooked wax moth larvae, and chocolate-covered crickets, which are called Chocolate Chirpies.
""Last year, we ran out of Chocolate Chirpies. We had to make about 6,000 of them this year,"" Blair said.
Many of the fair's visitors are kids. Emily Paulson, age 7, played with a millipede at the fair. The large bug crawled up her arm. She said, ""It's sort of like a comb crawling up your arm. It was neat!""

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

127,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

670,"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar systems giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

452,"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

Venus is the hottest planet. Its average surface temperature is 867 degrees.

253,"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.

shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.

The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.

A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works.
Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school.
So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.

They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

That victory marked the first time a team from Hawaii has won a Little League world championship. Hawaii's West Oahu of Ewa Beach team defeated a team from Curaao, a country in the Caribbean, 76.
It was not an easy win. Curaao was the defending champ. The game went into extra innings. Hawaii came back from three runs down to tie the game. It was the first time a championship had gone into extra innings since 1971.
The championship game was played in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, before more than 25,000 fans. (Little League Baseball began in Pennsylvania in 1939.)
Michael Memea, 12, of Hawaii cracked the game-winning home run. ""I knew it was gone,"" he later said proudly.
After his home run, Memea rounded the bases and high-fived his teammates, who were waiting for him at home plate. Then the team took a victory jog around the stadium while fans cheered wildly. After the win, Hawaii's team manager Layton Aliviado said, ""Our dream came true!""

659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

267,"During National SAFE KIDS Week, doctors plan to give kids tips about how to prevent accidents.
Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.

The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

The president of the United States lives and works in the White House. President George W. Bush hopes that it remains his home for the next four years. He is the Republican candidate who wants to be reelected president in November. Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, wants to send Bush packing.
George Washington never lived in the White House, but he selected the architect, James Hoban, to design it. The house took eight years to build, from 1792 to 1800.
John Adams, the second president, was the first to live in the White House. When he and his wife moved into the house on November 1, 1800, many of the rooms were not finished.
In 1814, when James Madison was president, British soldiers set fire to the White House. Workers took nearly three years to rebuild the famous house.
Painters need 570 gallons of white paint to cover the outside surface of the White House.
The White House has 132 rooms, including a movie theater, bowling alley, and swimming pool.
Since then, many new features and rooms have been added, including the

The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter.""
The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told
that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary.""
Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision.

Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga.
Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids
question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures.""
Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing.""
When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun.""

284,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

735,"Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face
When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

Alex is one of millions of kids who have made skateboarding one of the fastest-growing sports. There are an estimated 12 million skateboarders in the United States.
The number of girls who have gotten in on the action has also grown. Thanks in part to the X Games and top skating athlete Tony Hawk, skateboarding has exploded in popularity.
What is so appealing about the sport? ""I like to skateboard because when I see people at the skate parks and on television, I think I can be that good someday,"" Alex told
Although kids like Alex may be riding for the thrill of the sport, experts say skateboarding is a great form of exercise. It gets kids moving and keeps them in shape.
The benefits don't stop there either. Skateboarding builds concentration skills and motivates kids to

Skateboarding traces its roots to southern California. At one time, the sport got a bad rap for being a
Before towns and cities across the country built skate parks, many skateboarders were injured on public streets. They often performed tricks down stairs and across railings on buildings.
Today, the sport's reputation is getting a lift. The skate park in New Haven where Alex practices is one of more than 1,000 that have popped up nationwide in recent years. Skate parks contain ramps and other devices for kids to
Officials hope that skate parks will encourage skaters to practice in a safe environment. Although most skate parks require riders to wear helmets and other safety gear, it's hard to avoid the occasional cut.
Wearing a helmet the correct way helps to make skateboarding a safer sport.
Many skateboarders, however, are quick to point out that their sport is no more dangerous than bike riding or football. For Alex, skateboarding gives him a chance to spend time with his friends. ""It's really fun!"" he says.
Wheel sports--skateboarding, bike riding, and in-line skating--can be a lot of fun. They are also good ways to get moving. Follow these tips for a safe ride:
Make sure the helmet fits well. (If your helmet rocks forward or backward or from side to side, it's not protecting your head properly.)
Wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads.
If skateboarding or team sports aren't for you, don't sweat it. There are a lot of ways you can stay active. Here are a few ideas.
Besides exercise, what are some ways to keep your body healthy?

125,"Lack of Zzzs Can Lead to Injuries
Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

541,"Steve Cantees is a high school principal. He always worries about his students' grades and behavior. This year, he is also concerned about their school clothes.
His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees.
Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans.
For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds.
Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.
Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist.""
Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

531,"For most kids, the average school daysix and a half hoursis long enough. But in some states, officials want more time on students' side. Kids need more time to learn, they say.
More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

c) In total, Kate and Josh have thrown the die 60 times. You would expect them to obtain a 6 on 10 of those throws. However, it is very unlikely that Kate and Josh obtained exactly the same results, or that either of them threw a 6 on 5 occasions.
As you can see, if an experiment is repeated, the results are not necessarily the same each time.

Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, patterns of language that appear in both, or how language changes from the first to the second extract.
Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.
The exchanges between characters are short to speed up the action.
The speeches between Miranda and Ferdinand are much longer. The content is moving and romantic.

Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example,

In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'.

, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

. Think of a playground see-saw. The pivot is the thing in the middle of it. When no-one is on the see-saw it is level, but it tips up if someone gets onto one end. Turning forces around a pivot are called
It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

497,"> Atmosphere and setting - Implicit meaning
- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

The burning fuel releases waste gases, including carbon dioxide. As the human population increases, more fuel is used, and more carbon dioxide is released.
The extra carbon dioxide increases the greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped by the atmosphere, causing the planet to become warmer than it would be naturally. The increase in global temperature this causes is called

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

Q2. Look again at the number patterns above. Write the rule and the fourth terms for:
Pattern 4 has 3 orange tiles and 9 blue tiles, so 12 tiles altogether
a) The rule for the number pattern of orange tiles is 'add 1' and the 4th term is 3.

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears Ferdinand and Miranda say they love each other. He finally approves of their love.
On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.
A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage.
Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate.
Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano in a smelly pool
Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs.

To construct a pie chart you need to work out the fraction of the total that the sector represents. You can then convert this to an angle and draw the sector on the chart.
Constructing pie charts - using a table
The table below shows the grades achieved by 30 pupils in their end-of-year exam.
To show this information in a pie chart, take the following steps:
Work out the total number of pupils
: 7 + 11 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30
To work out the angle of each segment,
work out the fraction of the total that got each grade
There are 360 in a full turn, so to work out the angle,
The grade A sector has an angle of 84
Repeat this process to find the angle of the segments for the other grades
Once you have calculated the angles of the segments, construct the pie chart
Copy and complete the following table, then use the data to construct a pie chart.

Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.

214,"> Percentages - Percentage of a quantity
It's often useful to be able to find a percentage of a quantity. For example, you might be told that bus fares are going up by 5% and you need to know how much more you will need each week.
Here are a couple of ways you could do it:
Find 1% of the quantity by dividing it by 100.
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying 1% of the quantity by x.
Rakesh has a box containing 60 pens. 20% of the pens are red. How many is that?
You need to find 20% of 60.
1% of 60 is 60  100 = 0.6
So 20% of 60 is 0.6  20 = 12
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100
This combines the division and multiplication of Method 1 into one sum.

SECTION 2 - Act 3, Scene 1 (whole scene)
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed 
And he's composed of harshness! I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget 
 But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
, who watches from a distance, unseen.
Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down, and rest you. When this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study. Pray, now, rest yourself.
The sun will set before I shall discharge
I'll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that:
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
As well as it does you  and I should do it
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
No, noble mistress. 'Tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you 
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers 
I have broke your hest to say so!
Indeed the top of admiration  worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues
Have I liked several women  never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,
And put it to the foil. But you  o you,
So perfect and so peerless  are created
One of my sex  no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
I am skilless of  but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you 
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts
A prince, Miranda: I do think, a King
I would not so!  and would no more endure
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service  there resides,
To make me slave to it  and for your sake
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event,
If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I,
Beyond all limit of what else i'the world,
To weep at what I am glad of.
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give; and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling 
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife if you will marry me:
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
(He kneels) And I thus humble ever.
As bondage e'er of freedom! Here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised with all  but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book 
For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform

Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.

Extract 1 - Act 1, Scene 1, lines 98 to 232
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
Ill pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

10 pupils in a school study French and German at GCSE. Their marks for a recent test are recorded in the table below:
You can draw a scatter diagram to represent these marks. As Pete was absent on the day of the German test you do not have enough information to mark his score.
Looking at this scatter diagram there is strong positive correlation between the marks in French and the marks in German, so you can draw a line of best fit to show that trend.
Pete scored 70 in French, so using the line of his best fit, you can estimate that his mark in German would have been 72.
A line of best fit can only be drawn if there is strong positive or negative correlation.
The line of best fit does not have to go through the origin.

401,"> Listening - Showing you are listening
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made
Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills?
In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background.
In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.
None of them are good listeners and anyway, they shouldn't be chatting in class.

Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get
This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

During sexual intercourse the man's penis releases semen into the woman's vagina. Sperm cells travel in semen from the penis and into the top of the vagina. They enter the uterus through the cervix and travel to the egg tubes. If a sperm cell meets with an egg cell there, fertilisation can happen. Fertilisation happens when an egg cell meets with a sperm cell and joins with it.

Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.

6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.

Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:

391,"The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

3485,"There are four main types of industrial production -
production - which have progressively larger scales of operation. ICT is now important in virtually every type of commercial design and production, with different types of computer-control of design and making processes grouped together as
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
The different production methods may have different design requirements, but most commercial designers have three roles: a
relating to the performance of a product - its 'fitness for purpose'
relating to shape, style, colour, pattern and other aspects of a product's visual appeal
role and an organisational role. Designers need to be aware of the standards and conventions which regulate industrial design practices.
There are four main types of industrial production methods:
is when only one product is made at a time. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive. Products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods.
is when a small quantity of identical products are made - from two up to about 100. Batch production may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Batches of the product can be made as often as required. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product.
production is when hundreds of identical products are made, usually on a production line. Mass production often involves the assembly of a number of sub-assemblies of individual components. Some parts may be bought from other companies. There is usually some automation of tasks (eg by using
the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. CNC for short
machines) and this enables a smaller number of workers to ouput more products.
production is when many thousands of copies of identical products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to maximise production and eliminate the extra costs of starting and stopping the production process. The process is highly automated and few workers are required.
Computer-aided design and making are nowadays commonplace in industry. ICT is most often used in mass production, as computer control makes it possible to produce many identical items very quickly. But ICT is also useful in small batch and even one-off work, as computer control also enables complicated shapes to be produced more accurately than by hand.
The box summarises the many roles of ICT in industry:
Data can be stored electronically and retrieved easily.

You need to know and understand a number of terms used to describe aspects of ICT in design and production. They are:
Different production methods - eg, one-off, batch, and mass or continuous production - have somewhat different design requirements, related to the differences between types of product, client expectation, and the scale of operation. In particular there are differences in the relationship between the designer and the
person or organisation that wants a product manufactured - eg a retailer.

individual. Individual products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive.
production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.
production the process of designing is more formalised, but the number of people involved may still be quite small. The client may be the user, but is more likely to be another company who sell the product. The designer will not necessarily have any contact with the end-user of the product.

6135,"What to look for in your comparison
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.

Anne Hathaway's love of Shakespeare is confident and will last forever - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head - while Hopkins' is more tentative - he fears for the future and asks What would the world be? without the wilderness his poem evokes.

 at first, railways used stationary steam engines to wind wagons up banks. Then in 1800, Trevithick invented the steam-powered locomotive. The first steam-powered boat was built in 1802. This had significant effects, not only on industry and agriculture and the transport of goods, but on the transport of people and their mobility and social lives (eg holidays at the seaside).
 the steam engines used coal, so industry was located on the coalfields.
 steam engines were expensive, so mainly large firms could afford them. The steam engines allowed large-scale production.
 the steam engines never flagged or stopped, so this required significant changes in the way people worked. There was now no requirement for workers to be strong or skilled and, if a person was big, it could now be a disadvantage. The steam-powered machine did all the work, so children replaced men as the key workers in industry.

km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.

Study the table below, showing both the loneliness and the dreams of each of the main characters. You could use a table like this as the basis for an exam answer about
Central, unifying ideas that run through a text or performance.
Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the

A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.
Different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are used for different purposes due to their varying characteristics in reflection, absorption and transmission by various materials.
. X-rays mostly pass through skin and soft tissue, but they do not easily pass through bone or metal. X-rays are used to produce shadow photographs of bones to check for damage such as fractures. They are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage, and can detect objects hidden in the luggage of aircraft passengers.
Even low doses of X-rays can cause cells to become cancerous, so precautions are taken in hospitals to limit the dose received by patients and staff when X-ray photographs are taken.

In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with

For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.

- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).

Renaissance knowledge about the body and disease
The Early Modern Age was an exciting time for medicine, with knowledge of the human body progressing in fundamental ways - although the causes of disease remained a mystery.
Two key practitioners moved knowledge forwards in the Early Modern Age:
Follower of Vesalius in graveyard, searching for bodies to dissect
, whose patron was Charles V of Spain. He trained at Louvain, Paris and Padua universities, and ransacked cemeteries and gibbets for bones and for bodies to dissect.
. He also realised that the famous doctor Galen could be wrong, when he discovered that the great man was mistaken about there being two bones in the jaw, and about how muscles were attached to the bone.
He became professor of medicine at Padua University. He said that medical students should perform

He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.

is the shaking and vibration of the Earth's crust due to movement of the Earth's plates (plate tectonics). Earthquakes can happen along any type of plate boundary.
Earthquakes occur when tension is released from inside the crust. Plates do not always move smoothly alongside each other and sometimes get stuck. When this happens pressure builds up. When this pressure is eventually released, an earthquake tends to occur.
The point inside the crust where the pressure is released is called the focus. The point on the Earth's surface above the

We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created.
She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil.
Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone.
Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

There are five main arguments used to give proof that God exists. These arguments are usually applied to Christianity.

It is not possible to think of any being greater than God (as God is

Everything has to come from something. You cannot make something out of nothing.
Therefore there must have been a First Cause that created the something (the universe). That First Cause is God.
If you were walking on a heath and saw a watch on the ground you would assume that its parts had not come together by chance because it is too ordered and complicated. Therefore someone must have designed it or it would not work.
Because the universe is also ordered and complicated, someone must have designed that too. That 'someone' is God.
Some people claim that they have had a religious experience eg, a miracle (a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention), a vision, or a particular prayer to God answered.
Some people say that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong. They describe this as having a sense of morality.
This sense of morality has to come from somewhere, and the only possible source is God. Therefore God exists.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

6076,"Farmers started to work scientifically for the first time during the 1830s. Many new improvements were the result of individuals, such as Justus von Liebig, experimenting, observing and explaining how crop yields could be enlarged and improved.
The main improvements introduced in the 1830s, which were the main characteristics of High Farming, covered fertilisers, drainage and steam power coupled with support from government initiatives.
Illustration of a bird with guano (bird droppings)
- a scientist called Sir John Lawes started the production and use of phosphate fertilisers and super phosphates, which were initially by-products of industrial processes. The other most commonly used fertiliser from the 1830s onwards was guano (bird droppings) from the Andes Mountains in Peru. Soil in Britain became richer and produced higher yields as a result.
- new steam-operated machines were invented that could lay drainage pipes in straight lines. These drainage pipes cleared water from flooded fields and subsequently improved the quality of agricultural land in Great Britain.
- steam became the new method of powering farming machinery, which made the agricultural process more efficient. Examples of new steam-powered machinery included ploughs, seed drills, threshing machines and from 1852 onwards, steam-powered reapers. Unfortunately, most of these new steam-powered machines were invented in America and were not practical for use on the smaller enclosed British fields in the late 19th century.
- for the very first time, the government gave out 28 million in loans to help farmers use these new techniques and ideas on their fields. The government also forced remaining open land to be enclosed.

2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

What to look for in your comparison
Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.

The young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.
Both poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.

Source A: Instructions for treating a broken nose
If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured - part of it being squashed in while the other part is swollen and both his nostrils are bleeding, then you shall say: ""You have a broken nose and this is an ailment I can treat.""
You should clean his nose with two plugs of linen and then insert two plugs soaked in grease into his nostrils. You should make him rest until the swelling has gone down. You should bandage his nose with stiff rolls of linen and treat him with lint every day until he recovers.
Source B: Instructions for treating swellings in the body
When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger, then you must say to your patient: ""It is a tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will try to heal it with fire since cautery heals.""
When you come across a swelling that has attacked a channel, then it has formed a tumour in the body. If when you examine it with your fingers, it is like a hard stone, then you should say: ""It is a tumour of the channels. I shall treat the disease with a knife.""

If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y

The ozone layer is a high level layer of gas in the stratosphere. The ozone helps to keep out harmful ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn on human skin and damage plants.
The resulting ozone holes let harmful ultra-violet radiation in and add to the greenhouse effect.
CFCs can be used in aerosols, such as hairspray cans, fridges and in making foam plastics.

There are a range of techniques for enhancing the appearance of a drawing, making it look more like the real object. The technique used will depend on the type of drawing and what you are trying to show.
For this technique, thin lines are used in between adjoining surfaces. Thick lines are suitable when only one side can be seen. The drawing illustrates the idea.
of the same colour. A lighter tone is called a tint and is made by adding white to the base colour. A darker tone is called a shade and is made by adding black to the base colour.
Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.
There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour.
Colour is an important part of graphic design. You need to know the following facts about colour.
are made by mixing the primary colours as follows: red + yellow = orange; red + blue = violet; blue + yellow = green.
Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.
Yellow, orange and red are 'warm' colours; green and blue are 'cold'. Warm colours appear to come towards you from the page, while cold colours appear to recede.

The railways brought social, political and economic changes.
Once railways were established as Britain's newest and fastest communication and transport system, they started to have a number of effects on Britain. These effects can be put into three main categories:
- people becoming more aware of political movements and national news.
- improving the financial side of Britain.
Within 40 years, the arrival of trains had made a big impact on Britain and some of these changes can still be seen today.

Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our

You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -
Where a phrase or word is repeated several times to emphasise or make a particular point.
(line 16) suggests not only Heaney's affection for his grandfather, but his father's affection for him too: the love between them bonds the three generations.
Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Central, unifying ideas that run through a text or performance.
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.
.. living roots awaken in my head.
These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Step 1: write down the balanced symbol equation
Sulfuric acid is neutralised by sodium hydroxide, to make sodium sulfate and water, according to the following equation:
Step 2: work out the relative formula mass
The relative formula masses of the reactants and products can be worked out using relative atomic masses obtained from the periodic table.
relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 98
NaOH relative formula mass = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40
relative formula mass = (2 x 23) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 142
O relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 16 = 18
Step 3: work out the masses of reactants and products
The masses of reactants and products can now be worked out from the equation:
98 + (2x40) = 142 + (2x18)
98 + 80 = 142 + 36
These numbers can now be applied to
- grams, kilograms, tonnes, and so on. Now try the questions below.
What mass of sulfuric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce 10g of sodium sulfate?

What mass of sodium sulfate is made when 5.0 tonnes of sodium hydroxide is reacted with sulfuric acid?

This represents a good investment. The amount being earned per pound (0.31 rounded up) is much higher than most alternative investments would offer, like a building society savings account. Buying shares can be risky, as the value can fall as well as rise. A savings account earns an investor far less, but is safer. Either way, would-be investors will make a comparison with other investment opportunities.

One witness claimed that he had seen an iron bar driven through the cheek of one girl. Other alleged punishments included hanging iron weights around childrens necks, hanging them from the roof in baskets, nailing a childs ear to the table, and dowsing them in water butts to keep them awake.
 fines were imposed for things like talking or whistling, leaving the room without permission, of having a little dirt on a machine. It was claimed that employers altered the time on the clocks to make their workers late so that they could fine them.

3552,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six... I mean, we may have a new constitution, we may have on the face of it a beautiful democracy, but the racism in this country is absolutely redolent. We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.
