Rosa Parks seated on a Montgomery bus.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of an important event in history. In 1955, an African American woman named Rosa Parks was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for not giving up her bus seat to a white man. Rosa Parks's courage inspired many people, including King, to change that law and work for equal rights.
Today, people can visit the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It looks like it did in the 1950s. Now it is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan.

The fossils were from a sauropod (SAWR-uh-pahd). Sauropods were tall, plant-eating dinosaurs. The fossils were much smaller than other sauropod fossils.
The fossils were from a dinosaur that lived on an island in Germany. The dinosaur had little food to eat and little space to roam. It never grew!

A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells.
Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards.
Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes.
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians.
Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land.
For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land.

Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. Make sure you have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan, and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

507,"Summer is almost here! Why do experts say that summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids? During the summer, most schools are closed. Kids have more time to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. That means kids have more chances to get hurt.
Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade.
Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.
What's the Right Way to Wear a Helmet?
A helmet should be straight on the head, just above the eyebrows.
The chin strap should be snug but not too tight.
The rear straps go behind the ears; the front straps should run up and down.
One way to beat the summer heat is by swimming in a cool pool. To stay safe when you swim, you need to follow water-safety rules. Be water safe by swimming only when a grown-up is nearby. You should always swim with a buddy.
How else can you be safe this summer?

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.

Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.

The koala is a picky eater. To choose what to eat, it just follows its nose.
The menu for koalas is always the sameleaves! They eat only the leaves of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhs) trees. Sound boring? Not to a koala! There are thousands of these trees in Australia. The only problem is that leaves from some trees can make koalas very sick.
How does a koala know which leaves to choose? Scientists recently discovered that koalas learn from experience. After eating leaves that make them sick, the animals use their sense of smell to remember to avoid that type of leaf.
Scientists were not surprised to learn that koalas
means ""to like better."" Large trees have more leaves and offer better shelter to koalas.
A mother koala sits in a eucalyptus tree and holds her joey.
A marsupial is an animal that has a pouch in which to carry its young.
It looks like a small pink jellybean.
After a joey is born, it crawls into its mother's pouch. The joey drinks only its mother's milk for the first six months.
However, no matter how large the tree, koalas will not eat from one that makes them sick. They would rather go hungry than eat leaves from these trees, say scientists.

Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the
, or slogan, of this year's Olympic wrestling team. The wrestlers use this motto because they are proud to wrestle for their country. They want people to know that the competition of Olympic wrestling is tougher than the professional wrestling of Mankind and Shane McMahon.
In the Olympic Games, there are two styles of wrestling,
. In Greco-Roman, wrestlers can use only their arms and upper body. In freestyle, wrestlers can use their legs to trip their opponent.
Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.
Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.
Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.
U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes.
Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?

Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.

Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.

, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March.
The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.
The largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, is on Mars.
Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.
Why is water needed for life to exist?

In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.
Today, Linda Brown is grown up. She travels around the country to speak about the case. She recently told an audience, ""Little did my father know that when he stepped off the witness stand, he stepped into the history pages.""

Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wont find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold.
At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers.
She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a
, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free.
But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm.
To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats.
This bat lady, however, doesnt keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation.
. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyre actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment.
Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia.
However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees.
But Griswolds message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said.
There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a bats face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures.
Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but its usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victims skin.

Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.

Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods. Parent Brett Levy from Chicago, Illinois, believes that schools should teach kids to lead healthy lifestyles instead of reporting their BMIs. ""Telling a boy or girl [a] BMI is not education,"" he told
Schools should issue BMI reports for students.

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,

During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research.
Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who werent told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students performance in school.
The teachers could tell when students didnt get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons.
How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night.
Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests.

A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

Officials in Singapore, a country in Asia, totally banned chewing gum about ten years ago. Now that country is allowing people to chew some kinds of gum again.
Gum chewers, however, will need a doctor's prescription. A government official said Singapore will allow pharmacies to sell sugarless gum to sick patients if the rubbery substance can help cure them.
Singapore outlawed gum in 1992. Government officials were concerned that gum chewers were throwing lumps of used gum on streets. People, they said, were also sticking gum to subway cars. Yuck!

A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa.
Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal!
Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!

178,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, one brave woman's refusal to give up her bus seat changed history.
Honor the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest and the start of the Montgomery bus boycott with our classroom play.
During the 1950s, the law in the South prevented black
people from having the same rights as white people. At that time, the South was
by law. Black people were forced to sit in the back of public buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, drinking fountains, and other public facilities.
Those laws made Rosa Parks angry. She was a well-known leader in the African American community of Montgomery, Alabama. For years, Rosa Parks had stood up to unfair laws against African Americans. She worked courageously with other African American leaders to change them. She also was one of the first women in Montgomery to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to fight for
, or equal rights under the law.
Rosa Parks had refused to move from her seat on city buses in the past. Drivers simply forced her off the bus. But 50 years ago, on December 1, 1955, her action changed history. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person and was arrested. Her arrest led to the Montgomery
. During the yearlong boycott, African Americans refused to ride public buses. As a result of the boycott and Rosa Parks's courage, the law was changed to provide equal seating on buses. It marked the beginning of the struggle to end segregation.
SCENE 1: Downtown Montgomery, Alabama, December 1, 1955
Rosa Parks, 42, boards a city bus on her way home from work as a seamstress.
At the time, buses are divided into two sections. The section at the front of the bus is for whites only. The section for black people begins five to 10 rows back. Holding her head high, Rosa Parks sits down in the first row of the ""colored"" section.
After the bus grinds to a stop, a few white people get on. They quickly fill the empty seats in the ""whites-only"" section. One white man is left standing. According to a city law, black people are to give up their seats in the colored section if no seats remain in the white section.
There are white people who want to sit down.
You know white people and black people can't sit in the same row. Are you going to stand up?
Then I'm going to have you arrested.
A few minutes later, two police officers board the bus and walk toward Rosa Parks.
Did the driver tell you to stand?
Why do you all push us around?
I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest.
SCENE 2: Rosa Parks's house, that night
Rosa Parks is released from jail on bail that day. She and other Montgomery civil rights leaders meet at her house to discuss the bus boycott.
For years, civil rights leaders have been planning a bus boycott to fight segregation. They are waiting for the right time and the right leader to spark the boycottand Rosa Parks is that person. They know Rosa Parks has the courage to stand up to segregation. Because most of Montgomery's bus riders are black, the bus companies will lose money if black people refuse to ride the buses.
I know one thing, I will never, ever ride another segregated bus againeven if it means I have to walk to work.
You have to stand up for what you believe in.
Rosa, how would you feel about making your arrest a test case against segregation? We may be able to take this all the way to the Supreme Court.
I don't like being in the spotlight, and I don't want to put my family in danger.
Rosa, this may be our best chance to fight segregation laws.
Good. In the meantime, we're going to boycott the buses.
The next day, community leaders meet to discuss the boycott. At their request, Martin Luther King Jr. agrees to lead it.
SCENE 3: Montgomery courthouse, a few days later
Rosa Parks approaches the courthouse steps with her husband for her trial.
The steps of the courthouse are packed with people. Some bystanders threaten Rosa Parks. Others shout their support.
Your place is in the back of the bus, lady!
Oh, she's so sweet. They've messed with the wrong one now!
After Rosa Parks and her husband manage to push their way into the courtroom, the trial begins. The bus driver takes the stand.
I politely asked her to move to the back, which is required by city law. She refused to listen.
Rosa Parks is not called to the stand. Instead, her lawyers speak on her behalf.
I find Rosa Parks guilty of violating the city law. She must pay a $10 fine plus $4 in court costs.
The crowd of supporters in the courtroom reacts angrily to the verdict.
You haven't heard the last from us.
Despite the boos from supporters, the guilty verdict was exactly what Rosa Parks and her lawyers wanted. Their case eventually made it to the nation's highest courtthe Supreme Court.
Montgomery's black community continued to boycott the buses. On November 13, 1956, their efforts finally paid off. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's segregated buses were against the law. After more than a year, the boycott ended.
At the urging of photographers, Rosa Parks boarded a bus on December 20. This time, she sat in the front seat. (See the cover.)

Historians continue to debate whether people should be allowed to visit the shipwreck. Some think it should be left as a memorial to those who sank with the ship.
Marine explorer Robert Ballard found the Titanic wreck 18 years ago. He told Weekly Reader that he had mixed feelings about the discovery. Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said.
Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?
Ballard believes the wreck should be left alone. ""The site is a memorial, and it is better to bring people there through advanced technology rather than ravage the site through salvage,"" he said.

225,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.
Dobbin House was used as a ""station"" for hiding runaway slaves on their dangerous journey to freedom along the Underground Railroad.

Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits.
Mauna Kea is an extinct, or dead, volcano on the island of Hawaii. According to an ancient Hawaiian saying, Mauna Kea ""is the astonishing mountain that stands in the calm."" These days the 13,700-foot-high peak is anything but calm.
, scientists who study space, say the mountain peak is a perfect spot to place telescopes.
Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories.
The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu.
According to officials at the Center for Hawaiian Studies, the university is making money from the site without sharing much of the money with native Hawaiians.
""We don't get a penny from Mauna Kea, and it's our land,"" said Jon Osorio, of the Center for Hawaiian Studies.
University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future.
According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies.

How do changes taking place in the Supreme Court affect the lives of all Americans?
States is now in sessionwith a brand-new leader. John G. Roberts Jr. was recently sworn in as the 17th chief justice.
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. The Court is made up of nine judgeseight associate justices and one chief justice. Justices are appointed for life. The retirement or death of a justice can create an opening on the Supreme Court.
or chose, Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, the first woman justice, had announced in July that she would retire. But on September 3, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.
Bush then asked the Senate to consider Roberts for the chief justice position. The chief justice is considered the justice with the most influence on the Court.
""One of the most [important] decisions a president makes is his appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court,"" said Bush in his announcement of Roberts's nomination. ""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American.""
At press time, the president had nominated Harriet Miers to take over O'Connor's position. If Miers is confirmed, she will be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court, after O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
John Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 27, 1955. In high school, he was captain of his football team. He also wrestled, sang in the choir, and edited the school newspaper. After graduating from law school, he assisted then Associate Justice Rehnquist. He is married to a lawyer and has two childrenJosie, 5, and Jack, 4.
The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heads the judicial branch, one of three branches of the U.S. government. The other two branches are the legislative branch and the executive branch. Each branch has a different job.
The authors of the Constitution created the three branches to ensure that no branch had too much power. That system is called
The legislative branch makes laws. That branch is also called Congress and is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch carries out laws made by Congress. That branch is headed by the president. The judicial branch
or explains, the laws. Many courts across the nation make up the judicial branch.
A case makes its way to the Supreme Court through lower courts. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn rulings made in lower courts. Once the Supreme Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All lower courts must follow its decision in similar cases.
How does a person become a Supreme Court justice?
1. The president nominates a person to serve as a justice.
2. A group of senators, called the Senate Judiciary Committee, asks the nominee his or her opinions about various laws and cases.
3. The Judiciary Committee votes on the nominee.
4. If the nominee is approved by the Judiciary Committee, all 100 U.S. senators vote. (There are two senators for each state.)
5. A nominee is confirmed if he or she receives 51 votes. Roberts was confirmed by a Senate vote of 78 to 22.
Roberts is the youngest chief justice since John Marshall led the Supreme Court more than 200 years ago. At age 50, Roberts is likely to be chief justice for a very long time. The chief justice decides which cases the Court will hear. In many cases, the chief justice speaks first and leads the debate.
During his swearing-in ceremony, Roberts said to President Bush, ""There is no way to repay the confidence you have shown in me other than to do the best job I possibly can do, and I'll try to do that every day.""

Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or
, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.
The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.

The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year.
Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!
The hole was so large that, for the first time ever, the health of thousands of people who live in southern South America was threatened.

At the time he read the story, Brandon didn't think he would ever need to use the Heimlich maneuver. But what he learned from the article later helped him save a life.
During lunch on October 3, Brandon looked up and saw a classmate, Joseph Dettwiler, choking and frantically pointing to his throat.

674,"The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.
Queen Nefertiti's name means ""the beautiful one has come."" It is not surprising that she was given such a name. Queen Nefertiti has long been admired for her swanlike neck and high cheekbones.
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa.
Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps.
led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti.
Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like.
What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign.
""If the mummy is who we think it is, it would certainly help to answer a lot of unanswered questions,"" said Fletcher.
Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past.
There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn.
In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent.
Not all scientists are convinced that the mummy is Nefertiti.
""If the mummy is female and if it is royal, then you still do not necessarily have Nefertiti,"" one archaeologist told
Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears.
But Fletcher believes that she has found the long-lost queen and has returned Nefertiti to her rightful place in history.
The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River.
Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case.
, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings.
The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).
(The modern name is Amarna.) They also made many changes to the style of art and architecture of the time.
Many historians think that when Nefertiti's husband died, she became pharaoh.

The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.

But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.

Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""

who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British

""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.

However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online.
Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store.

Many people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.
During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.
To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.
For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.
Do you think fear of being punished will stop people from swapping music online? Why or why not?

In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea.

The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.

""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.

Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called

Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.

: How did you film the movie and go to school at the same time?
: I go to school three hours a day, every day. I have a fantastic teacher.
: How have your friends and family reacted to your fame?
: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry.
: In what ways has your life changed since the first movie came out?
: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that.
: When you grow up, do you want to continue acting?
: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes.

Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.

The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more

The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Ben, who is from California, is no stranger to the disease. He learned that he had a type of cancer called leukemia when he was five years old.
Why did Ben invent the video game? When he was in the hospital, he relied on video games to take his mind off being sick. That inspired him to help other kids who have cancer.
The result is ""Ben's Game""--named after its creator. The game takes place inside the body and stars a boy hero who moves around the screen on a skateboard. The boy is modeled after Ben. The object of the game is to blast cancer cells.
Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ben's idea became a reality. The foundation helped Ben work with a software designer to create his video game. Ben's game is now available free online. To play, visit

New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is a billionaire who could take a limousine to work. Instead, he rides the subway to his office at City Hall each morning.

On October 27, 2004, New York City marked the

Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.

Tortoises and other unique wildlife are safe after a volcano erupts on the Galpagos Islands.
RED ALERT Sierra Negra erupts on the Galpagos Islands for the first time in 26 years.
The Galpagos Islands are home to wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. Here, the islands famous giant tortoises and other unique wildlife roam freely. People were worried that those wildlife were harmed after a volcano on Isabela, the largest of the Galpagos Islands, erupted.

179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

247,"Is silencing parents a winning idea for kids' sports?
Loud parents are a growing problem at youth sporting events. Nearly 60 percent of people think that parent behavior in youth sports is worse today than it was five years ago, according to the National Association of Youth Sports. ""Parents are trying to yell and scream to make their kids play better, and that just doesn't work,"" sports expert and former coach Gregory Dale told
Dale and other sports experts are fans of an idea called ""Silent Saturdays."" Silent Saturdays are special game days during which parents aren't allowed to yell, scream, shout, or even speak. They can only clap to celebrate good plays and whisper to each other. Sports programs from California to New Jersey have instituted Silent Saturdays. Is quieting the sidelines a good call?
Silence helps keep parents' behavior under control.
Some sports leagues think zipping parents' lips is a great idea. The Dynamo Soccer Association in Bourbonnais, Illinois, started having Silent Saturdays last year. ""We're not trying to punish parents,"" Dynamo Soccer board member Ben Smith told
""It's just a stress-free day for the kids.""
At first, some parents were skeptical, or unsure, of the idea. But Smith says the quiet games were a big success. Instead of shouting, parents held encouraging signs and applauded. Everyone could hear the kids talking to each other on the field during the games. ""There was no negative criticism throughout the day,"" adds Smith. This year, the Dynamo board is considering two Silent Saturdays, and nearby soccer leagues are giving the program a try.
Parents should be allowed to cheer on their kids.
Silence doesn't work for everyone. For example, two grandparents in Bourbonnais were disappointed because they had traveled to cheer at their grandkids' game, but they had arrived on a Silent Saturday. Some experts think keeping family members quiet isn't the solution. ""Parents hate it,"" Jim Thompson, head of Positive Coaching Alliance, told
""If you want parents to be positive, this is not the best way to do it.""
Thompson says the solution is to train parents to cheer in a way that promotes
or fair play. Thompson prefers ""Honor the Game Days"" to Silent Saturdays. What's the difference? ""Rather than telling parents to be quiet, at Honor the Game Days, [we tell parents] how to support their kids,"" he says.

One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.

Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.

During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told

Don't expect the rovers to find little green aliens on the fourth planet from the sun. Instead, they will be on the lookout for signs that water once flowed on Mars. They will also search for evidence that some ice exists under the planet's surface. Scientists say that evidence of water on Mars can mean that life once existed on this planet.
Unlike Earth, Mars is dusty, very cold, and dry. ""We're going to look for signs that tell us that Mars may have been warmer and wet in the past,"" said a
Still, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. It has mountains, valleys, ice caps, and dry riverbeds.
The Red Planet even has seasons, wind and dust storms, and a rocky surface.
The seven-month journey for the rovers won't be an easy one. So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing.
The rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet.
The rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars' surface and take pictures of them.
Then, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day.
""We will be using the rovers to find rocks and soils that could hold clues about [the possibility of water in] Mars' past,"" said another NASA scientist.
Missions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other. Mars recently made its closest pass to Earth in 60,000 years. On August 27, Mars was only about 34 million miles from Earth.

""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.

A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

The court's decision affects nearly 10 million schoolchildren in nine western states. The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States.
Michael Newdow of California brought the case to court. He argued that his daughter, now in the fourth grade, should not have to listen to the pledge recited daily, because of its reference to God. ""I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution,"" he told CNN.

722,"Educators spread the word about slavery in the North.
Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828. In 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth. She traveled throughout New England and the Midwest, speaking publicly against slavery and in favor of womens rights.

The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.
Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.
Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.
Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.

Few plants or animals live on the icy mountaintops in southern Argentina and Chile. The region is cold, desolate, and snowy.
The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.

To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:

The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey.

""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.
(died at age 34): She was Echo's eldest daughter. Erin died from a spear injury after she wandered too close to a watering hole protected by the local Masai people.

(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.

(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.

587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

Over the years, many people have dreamed of going to Mars. The day when travel to Mars is possible is coming closer. Robot spacecraft have already traveled there. Those spacecraft have made many amazing discoveries.
The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is
. It started orbiting the red planet more than a year ago.
Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.
Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.
There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.

Not all scientists agree, however. Many scientists say wind blowing across Mars caused the streaks. Scientists have long known about powerful wind storms on Mars. Some of those storms blow across the surface for months at a time.
Even if liquid water and life do not exist on Mars today, many scientists agree with Danny. They want to explore the red planet.""I'm interested in Mars because it's probably the most fascinating planet in the solar system besides Earth, and probably the only one that could have ever supported other forms of life,"" said one NASA scientist.

It was a big day at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. First the mother cheetah came out of her cage. Then came one, two, three, four, five cubs. The babiesborn this summerleaped and played around their mother. The cubs, then just 10 weeks old, weighed only 9 pounds and were about the size of house cats.

Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word
in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them.

As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.

Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game. A student dressed as the famous Seminole leader Chief Osceola (ah-see-OH-luh) charges down the field on a horse. The student launches a flaming spear into the air, which lands midfield. The fans, a sea of red and gold, cheer wildly.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tried to end that tradition. The NCAA is the organization that oversees college sports. The NCAA banned the use of Native American names, logos, or
by sports teams after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots. Although the chief will ride again, the ban remains for at least 17 schools with Native American team names and mascots. Check out both sides of the debate.

""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""
Those against the NCAA's new rules, including many Native Americans, say the recent ban is ridiculous. They believe that team names and mascots honor the traditions of Native Americans.
Florida Governor Jeb Bush challenged the ban. He said it insulted Seminoles who support FSU's traditions. Seminole tribe members designed the mascot's costume, say others. They add that the student who rides Chief Osceola's horse earns that honor after studying the tribe's culture.

Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.

When you are infected by a microbe, it takes time for your body to start fighting the infection. It does this by making enough white blood cells with the correct antibody. During this time, you continue to feel unwell.
You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood.

Immunisation is a process that doctors use to make people immune from certain illnesses, even before they have been infected. It involves you receiving an injection containing a
Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill.
You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella.
Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.

The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach

. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop
You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale.
Avoid clichs. These are phrases that are used so much that they have lost their power. For instance, if you are ""over the moon"" about something, or ""waiting until the cows come home"", then you are using clichs. Look for original phrases instead.

There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.

Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.

If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.

Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but

We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo.
That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate.
Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made

No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.

Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.

The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.

Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.

Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you.

Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the

Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called

More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years.
Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use.
We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out.
The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worlds forests are steadily shrinking.

It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5

To see whether there is a correlation between the Maths and English marks, you could plot a scatter diagram.
The Maths mark is on the horizontal scale and the corresponding English mark on the vertical scale.

In the scatter diagram above, whose mark does the small red cross represent?
The co-ordinates of the cross are (80, 70).
Therefore, the Maths mark is 80 and the English mark 70.
You can see that all the points representing Maths marks and English marks lie approximately along a straight line. This shows that there is a correlation between these two variables.
The table below shows the correlations that you can deduce from different patterns of scatter.
The points lie close to a straight line, which has a positive gradient.
This shows that as one variable increases the other increases.
The points lie close to a straight line, which has a negative gradient.
This shows that as one variable increases, the other decreases.
There is no pattern to the points.
This shows that there is no connection between the two variables.
Would you expect there to be positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation between the following pairs of variables:
a) As temperature increases, the sales of ice-cream are also likely to increase. Therefore, there is likely to be positive correlation.

In most uses of electricity we don't want to produce heat. Any heat that is produced is wasted energy. Appliances that transfer less of the electricity they use into wasted heat are more

Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

Meanwhile, Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has sent a letter to Montague's house challenging Romeo to a duel. Mercutio jokes about how good a swordsman Tybalt is, comparing him to a dancer. He calls him Prince of Cats. When Romeo turns up, Mercutio makes lots of rude jokes, and Romeo, who is now in a good mood joins in.
The Nurse warns Romeo not to mess Juliet around. He tells her that the wedding will be that afternoon at Friar Lawrence's place. The Nurse is really excited.
When the Nurse arrives back at the Capulet's house, Juliet is beside herself with impatience. The Nurse teases her and makes her wait for the good news.
Juliet meets Romeo at Friar Lawrence's and they go off to get secretly married.
Meanwhile, Mercutio squabbles with Benvolio. Benvolio is worried that the Capulets might turn up looking for a fight. Tybalt appears looking for Romeo. Mercutio teases him. Romeo arrives and refuses to fight Tybalt. Romeo tells him he loves him! (It's because Tybalt is now his relation through marriage, but he can't tell anyone that because the wedding is still a secret!) Mercutio fights Tybalt in Romeo's place. Romeo gets between them and, as a result, Mercutio is fatally wounded. He dies cursing both families. Romeo's grief at his friend's death quickly turns to rage. He kills Tybalt. Remembering Prince Escalus's warnings, Benvolio begs Romeo to run away.
Lady Capulet wants Romeo to be put to death for murdering Tybalt, but Prince Escalus points out that Tybalt killed Mercutio. He orders that Romeo should be sent away from Verona and not allowed back.

as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long.
Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.
The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun.
During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this:
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west.
One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""
"", which means the Earth spins from west to east.
Star trails made by leaving the camera shutter open during the night
During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day.

- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to argue
The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument..
It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be
as you haven't thought about any other views.
A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear.
Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not.

Food chains - Getting carbon dioxide, light and water

Let's see how plants get the carbon dioxide and water they need for this process.
Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves. The carbon dioxide
through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. (One of these holes is called a stoma. The plural is stomata.)
The lower part of the leaf has loose-fitting cells, to allow carbon dioxide to reach the other cells in the leaf. This also allow the oxygen produced in photosynthesis to leave the leaf easily.
A leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. Its top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy layer.
The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains a type of cell called a
. This is adapted to absorb a lot of light. It has lots of chloroplasts and is shaped like a tall box.
Turgid plant that's watered regularly and a flacid plant without enough water.
Plants get the water they need for photosynthesis through their roots.
The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell - these project out from the root into the soil. Roots have a big surface area and thin walls, which allow water to pass into them easily.
Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot photosynthesise.
The water absorbed by the root hair cells passes through the plant in
tubes, and eventually reachers the leaves. If a plant does not absorb enough water, it will wilt or go floppy. Without water it may also not photosynthesise quickly enough, and it may die.

It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.
It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book.
Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied.
So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.
Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do.
Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers.

Measures of average - Mean from a frequency table
Sara wanted to know the ages (in whole years) of children on her school bus. She conducted a survey and her results are shown below:
To find the mean add all the ages together and divide by the total number of children.
If you type all those ages into a calculator it is highly likely that you would make a mistake or forget where you were up to.
It would be better if you could see these results displayed in a frequency table:
The frequency table shows us that there are six children aged 11, seven children aged 12, five children aged 13...etc.
To find the sum of their ages, calculate:
(6  11) + (7  12) + (5  13) + (7  14) + (3  15) + (2  16) = 390
The total number of children is 6 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 30

The part that illusion has to play
The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,

even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.

For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.

As well as providing valuable evidence to support your finding, statistics can be misleading. They are often used to prove a point, and can easily be twisted in favour of that point.
Here are some examples of misleading graphs.
What is wrong with this bar chart? How should the information be represented?
From this graph, it looks as though house prices have trebled in one year! It is misleading because the vertical axis does not start at 0. Look at the 'improved' version of the same graph. This gives a much more accurate picture of what has happened.
Although the vertical scale starts at 0, it does not go up in even steps. This distorts the graph, and makes it look as though the biggest jump is between 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4.
Also, there are no labels on the axes, so we have no idea what this graph represents!
What is wrong with this 3D bar chart?
This 3D bar chart might look very attractive, but it is also very misleading. There is no scale on the vertical axis and, because of the perspective, it looks as though sales for 1995 were far greater than those for any other year. In fact, they were identical to those in 1997.
The data would be better represented on a 2D-bar chart, with appropriate labelling on each axis:
What is wrong with this pictogram showing the number of people who own different types of pets?
On this pictogram, there is no category for people who do not own a pet. The pictures are different sizes, and it appears that more people own a horse than any other animal.
An improvement would be to redraw the pictogram, with each of the animals the same size and aligned with one another like this:

. The individual fullerene molecules or nanotubes have different properties from the bulk material.
The nanotubes structure allows it to be used as a vessel for transporting a drug into the body. A molecule of the drug can be placed inside the nanotube cage which keeps the drug wrapped up until it reaches the site where it's required. In this way, a dose that might be prohibitively damaging to other parts of the body can be delivered safely to, say, a cancerous tumour.
The structure of nanotubes involves a massive surface area. Spreading a catalyst, atom by atom, on the surface of a nanotube provides a huge surface area where reactants can come into contact with the catalyst.
The examples above might be described as molecular manufacturing or nanotechnology. Building a product molecule by molecule, positioning molecules one at a time or producing nanoscale features by removing matter from a bigger structure may enable us to do things which only a short time ago were undreamed of.

5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

energy transferred (joules, J) = mass of water heated (grams, g)  4.2  temperature rise (C)
For a given amount of water heated up, the greater the temperature rise, the greater the amount of heat energy transferred to the water. For example, twice as much energy is transferred to the water to achieve a temperature increase of 20C compared with 10C.
You can compare fuels by measuring the mass of fuel burned in the experiment. The best fuel is likely to release the most energy per gram of fuel. This is worked out using:

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows.
She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997.
'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part.
Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements.
Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it.
My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions.
I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.

6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.

Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:

3342,"Food additives are included in food to improve their shelf-life, appearance and flavour. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid prevent food from going off by reacting with oxygen. Emulsifiers help oil and water to mix - for example, in mayonnaise. Active packaging meanwhile improves the quality or safety of food.
Everything in food is made from chemicals. Some of these are natural, and some are artificial. Processed foods, including vegetable oils, may have chemicals added to them. These
have different roles, including extending a products shelf-life and improving its taste and appearance.
You can find additives listed on the ingredients label. Many have E numbers to identify them. The table below describes some of these:
orange colouring for soft drinks, sweets and sauces
allows oil and water to mix to make margarine, ice-cream and salad cream
Additives with an E number have been licensed by the European Union. Some are natural, some artificial. But they have all been safety tested and passed for use.
The UK Food Standards Agency - FSA - has strict limits on the amount of colouring allowed in food. Some people have allergic reactions to certain additives, and colourings are banned from baby food.
A red dye called 'Sudan I' was banned for use in food because it was thought to be a health risk. Some of the dye had been used in chilli powder before the ban came into force, and the dye was later added in this form to some foods by mistake. Hundreds of food items had to be taken off supermarket shelves and destroyed.
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.
bacteria and fungi grow on or in the food
chemical reactions take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Modern packaging is designed to control or prevent reactions in food that make it go off. Such packaging includes:
cans that will cool down or heat up their contents
Ascorbic acid - vitamin C - is an antioxidant that is found naturally in foods such as citrus fruits, green peppers, green, leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, and potatoes. As E300, it may be added to food such as meat pies and salad cream.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen (as well as the food itself) to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Active packaging improves the quality or safety of the food it contains.
Oxygen can be restricted by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available so that microbes cannot grow and reproduce.
There are other benefits to this method:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals.

5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.

3485,"There are four main types of industrial production -
production - which have progressively larger scales of operation. ICT is now important in virtually every type of commercial design and production, with different types of computer-control of design and making processes grouped together as
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
The different production methods may have different design requirements, but most commercial designers have three roles: a
relating to the performance of a product - its 'fitness for purpose'
relating to shape, style, colour, pattern and other aspects of a product's visual appeal
role and an organisational role. Designers need to be aware of the standards and conventions which regulate industrial design practices.
There are four main types of industrial production methods:
is when only one product is made at a time. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive. Products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods.
is when a small quantity of identical products are made - from two up to about 100. Batch production may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Batches of the product can be made as often as required. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product.
production is when hundreds of identical products are made, usually on a production line. Mass production often involves the assembly of a number of sub-assemblies of individual components. Some parts may be bought from other companies. There is usually some automation of tasks (eg by using
the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. CNC for short
machines) and this enables a smaller number of workers to ouput more products.
production is when many thousands of copies of identical products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to maximise production and eliminate the extra costs of starting and stopping the production process. The process is highly automated and few workers are required.
Computer-aided design and making are nowadays commonplace in industry. ICT is most often used in mass production, as computer control makes it possible to produce many identical items very quickly. But ICT is also useful in small batch and even one-off work, as computer control also enables complicated shapes to be produced more accurately than by hand.
The box summarises the many roles of ICT in industry:
Data can be stored electronically and retrieved easily.
Designs can be modelled on-screen and viewed from any angle.
Reaction to outside forces, such as wind flow and pressure can be modelled.
""Zoom"" facilities can allow for the whole product or one detail to be easily seen.
Libraries of standard components can be stored electronically and integrated into new designs.
Control sequences can be simulated before working on the actual material.
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing is usually more accurate.
You need to know and understand a number of terms used to describe aspects of ICT in design and production. They are:
Different production methods - eg, one-off, batch, and mass or continuous production - have somewhat different design requirements, related to the differences between types of product, client expectation, and the scale of operation. In particular there are differences in the relationship between the designer and the

production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.

2476,"will ask you to look at the relationships between the characters, their feelings or problems. You could also be asked to write about how characters are presented by Doris Lessing, the writer, or the methods she uses. Whatever you are asked to do, make sure you read the question very carefully and spend some time planning your answer.
One important thing to remember is that these questions might look very different but they often cover very similar ground. For instance, if you are going to write about the old man, you need to show how the writer presents him. Or if you are writing about the problems a character faces, you should also look at their relationships with other characters in the story.
The other thing to remember is that there are a lot of different ways to answer the same question. You do not have to include things in a fixed order.
It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters and themes.
It is also useful to include a personal reaction. This shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied someone else's ideas. For instance, you might feel sympathetic to the old man's situation, or feel he has no right to try to control Alice as he does.
In addition, try to include short quotes in your answer. The previous sections have plenty of examples, like using in a single word:
When he lets the pigeon escape he smiles 'proudly' at his granddaughter.
You can also use a short phrase, such as:
She stares, does 'not smile' and is 'wide-eyed, and pale' with 'tears shivering off her face.
Many people make the mistake of regurgitating numerous sentences, or even complete paragraphs, from the story. There is no need for this. It wastes time and does not provide a focus to your answer. Instead, look for a specific point and the exact word or words to illustrate it. Next, we will look at an example these techniques.
The old man is clearly the main focus of
. He is the first character we meet, and the one we know most about. For instance, we find out he lives with his daughter and her family, and how important his pigeons are to him.
Lessing also writes the story mainly from his point of view. For instance, we are told his thoughts, such as thinking about how his other granddaughters were 'transformed' by marriage and became 'serious young matrons' rather than girls who doted on their grandfather. In this way, the old man is shown to be rather selfish - he is thinking more about himself than the happiness of others in his family. This is most clearly shown when he asks his daughter about Alice and if they can 'keep her a bit longer'.
This is a good start - it keeps to the point and does not waste time retelling the entire story. It also includes short examples to make each point clearer.
The word 'keeping' might strike us as rather odd, because it is usually reserved for animals, not your children or grandchildren. However, Lessing draws several comparisons between particular characters and animals, in particular the pigeons. I especially liked the old man's fingers 'curling like claws into his palms', because it made me think he was becoming just like his birds. It also indicates that his quiet rage is building up as he starts to speak to Alice.
Alice seems to be the one the old man loves the most, but also despises. At times he is very rude to her, even calling her an 'impudent little bit of rubbish'. Yet it is obvious to me that he loves her deeply and can hardly bear to see her leave. For instance, he almost instantly regrets being rude to her, and starts to cry when he learns she is going to marry Steven.
Lessing seems to use contrasts like this throughout the story. For example, the behaviour of the old man and Lucy is very effectively portrayed. The old man is angry, stamps his feet and shouts like a child, while his daughter is able to humour him, and even 'croons' like one of his pigeons to calm him down.
This is only the start of the task. There is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction. It continues to treat each point fairly briefly, but manages to refer to the plot, language, relationships and themes. It also includes some of the writer's personal thoughts, giving a wide-ranging and detailed discussion of how the old man is presented in the story.

Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

6135,"What to look for in your comparison
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.

to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.

Moniza Alvi: Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
How do you think this poem should be read?
In a confused voice, as if the girl cannot decide whether she is more Pakistani or English?
Wistfully, as if she regrets having lost her original culture?
Gratefully, as she thinks about the beautiful, exotic gifts?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
In an interview, Moniza Alvi has said:
Growing up, I felt that my origins were invisible, because there weren't many people to identify with in Hatfield at that time of a mixed race background or indeed from any other race, so I felt there was a bit of a blank drawn over that. I think I had a fairly typically English 1950s/1960s upbringing.
When I eventually went to Pakistan, I certainly didn't feel that was home, I'd never felt so English. But I never feel entirely at home in England, and, of course, I'm not part of the Asian community at all. And it feels a bit odd sometimes that because of the group of poems that I've written about my Asian background, I sometimes tend to be identified as a black writer. I tend to think of England as being very culturally mixed now.
But it's important to know where you come from, which is perhaps what I was lacking as a child. I think it's important to know what has gone into your making, even quite far back, I think it gives you a sense perhaps of richness.

Sporting events and sports personalities are bigger, brighter and more branded with big money sponsorship deals than ever before; just look at major events like the Premier Leagues Barclays Bank partnership. Then theres our perception of sport through the eyes of the media; what you read and see isnt always the truth and can often be affected by international politics. Today, many athletes are role models and celebrities in their own right. Well, who hasnt heard of David Beckham?
To support an event, activity or person by providing money or goods.
is a major feature of sport in the 21st century.
Most competitions have sponsors names included in their title:
Some sports stadia have sponsored names. For example:
Most clubs and teams have sponsors. For example:
is no longer legal. Sports Governing Bodies have to decide if proposed sponsorship, say junior sport by an alcohol brand, is acceptable.
It is always easier to get sponsorship if a sport or event receives media attention. High profile events gain greater amounts of sponsorship than those with no coverage.
There are pros and cons of sponsorship:
Increased publicity, status increased by being linked to success and glamour. Increased sales of their products
Negative events (drug use, cheating, crowd trouble) may affect your reputation
Free clothing and equipment or payment for wearing sponsor's clothing and using their equipment. Can concentrate on training without financial worries.
May be tied in to a contract including appearances at sponsors' events.
Financial support in addition to admission fees etc.
Dates, times, clothing may be changed to suit the sponsor.
a collective name for images, video and audio
coverage of sport is widespread. By listening to commentators, pundits and watching replays we improve our knowledge and understanding. Participation in sports covered by the media is always higher than for those that are not.
When watching sport on TV it is important to understand that the director of the programme will have an influence on what is seen and said. You should always analyse what you see and develop your own opinions about events.
Media coverage has many pros and cons:
Attendances may rise as people want to see the 'stars'
Gives viewers a close-up view of the action
Attendances may drop - more people watch from home
Some sports get lots of exposure, while others get none
Events can be sensationalised to promote the media (TV channel, newspaper etc), rather than the sport
Changes to playing season (eg rugby league)
Changes to the rules (eg badminton, volleyball rally-point rules, tennis tie-breaks)
NB Some of these may not been seen as disadvantages by those involved, but they do show the influence of the media.
The conduct of players, officials and spectators has an effect on the image of individual sports and the expectations of behaviour by those involved in them. Compare some examples of conduct in sports:
Golfers are expected to own up to anything they do wrong
- Players are expected to own up to anything that they do wrong and even disqualify themselves.
- Diving by players to get a free kick or penalty is increasing and almost everyone is complaining about it. But accepting the rewards when cheating benefits
- Opposition fans sit and stand together and there is usually a friendly atmosphere. Police presence and stewarding is light. Video surveillance is almost unheard of.
- Although most supporters enjoy the company of the opposition's fans, they are segregated to avoid outbreaks of violence by a minority. Groups of fans taunt each other with insults. Police presence and stewarding is very well organised. Video surveillance is used to identify troublemakers who are banned from future matches. All-seater stadia are required for all Premier League and international matches.
- The laws of the game penalise players for arguing with the referee although some acts of violence are dealt with as part of the game. Etiquette requires that the players always clap each other off the field and problems are left on the pitch.
- Players often surround the referee to argue with decisions. Acts of violence are often made worse by other players becoming involved and fans continuing to inflame the situation by booing players. Some disagreements on the pitch are continued and fights can break out in the tunnel after the game.
Do the fans encourage players to play well or behave badly? Or do the players incite the fans to celebrate or abuse each other?

A sportsperson who is paid to take part in sport.
. Tennis and rugby union are examples of sports that attempted to remain amateur but are now ' open' which means no distinction is made between amateurs and professionals. One of the reasons was the widespread abuse of hidden payments to amateurs following the worldwide increase in money for sport from the media.
Key differences between amateurs and professionals are:
Participation is more important than the result
Winning is the most important thing. The more they win, the more they earn
Political and financial issues that have affected international sports events
Despite the many advantages of hosting a major international event host nations must be prepared for difficulties. The Olympic Games has suffered from a number of different types of problem. These include:
Race issue: Black Power - 1968, Mexico City
Boycott by some nations - 1984, Los Angeles
For the exam you should know a little bit about each of these and you should keep up-to-date with events as they happen.
The 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies suffered problems relating to high ticket prices which prevented many locals from attending whilst matches were played in near empty stadiums. In addition the media coverage and police action surrounding the death of Pakistan coach, Bob Woolmer, took attention away from the matches.
The 2008 Beijing Olympics have generated lots of media intest and the 2012 London Olympics and future Football and Rugby World Cups will create many discussion points over the next few years.
The role of local and national sports providers
funded facilities are paid for by national and local government out of taxes and National Lottery funding. They can be found throughout the country.
They are available for everyone to use and are relatively cheap.
They include sports/leisure centres, swimming pools and outdoor pitches.
Some schools share facilities with the local authority for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
funded facilities are set up by private companies that try to make a profit. They are often members-only clubs. Members pay fees to join and use the facilities.
They are likely to be more expensive.
They include sports/fitness clubs, golf and tennis clubs.
Some schools pay to use private sports clubs for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
Local authorities encourage participation in sport by employing sport development teams including School Sports Coordinators who arrange events, assist with coaching and develop links with clubs in the area of schools.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.

- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.

A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

How can we know if there is something we call God?
There are five main arguments used to give proof that God exists. These arguments are usually applied to Christianity.
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
. Therefore God (like unicorns) exists in the mind.
It is not possible to think of any being greater than God (as God is
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
). Therefore God must exist in reality.
Everything has to come from something. You cannot make something out of nothing.
Therefore there must have been a First Cause that created the something (the universe). That First Cause is God.
If you were walking on a heath and saw a watch on the ground you would assume that its parts had not come together by chance because it is too ordered and complicated. Therefore someone must have designed it or it would not work.
Because the universe is also ordered and complicated, someone must have designed that too. That 'someone' is God.
Some people claim that they have had a religious experience eg, a miracle (a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention), a vision, or a particular prayer to God answered.
Some people say that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong. They describe this as having a sense of morality.
This sense of morality has to come from somewhere, and the only possible source is God. Therefore God exists.

The basic function of packaging has always been to protect and contain a product. In a competitive market, branding and packaging are important and have become an integral part of the product. We instantly recognise products by the size, shape and colour of packaging.
The marketing department give a product a unique look and decide on the package design. This will incorporate the
and will differentiate the product from competitors.This is known as a
The unique thing about the product that makes consumers buy it. This can be branding, packaging or a feature of the product.
The shape, size and colour are important factors when packaging a product. The marketing department will want to make the packaging attractive and distinctive. Coke's packaging is dominated by red. This helps consumers to recognise a product instantly, when they are in a shop. The same applies to the shape of the packaging. Deodorants and shampoos, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Remember that the actual product is inside the container, so the packaging and advertising are all that will attract us to try a product in the first place.
Large manufacturers understand the importance of their brand name. Kellogg's, Adidas and Microsoft are all household names which we associate with quality. As a result, we are likely to buy one of their products when we go shopping rather than an untried or unknown one even if it is say, a supermarket's
A company, say a supermarket, produces its own brand of a well known product eg Cola.

is to give a product a distinctive image which will differentiate it from similar products. An expensive perfume or aftershave might be sold in an elegantly designed bottle. This sort of packaging suggests quality and would be targeted at a person with taste. Even if the product itself was not very good, the packaging alone could give the impression that it was.
The success of a product through branding can lead to
Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand.
. A positive buying experience results in repeat sales. Consumers tend to stick to a product if we like it. This in turn can lead to a trust in other products under the same brand name.
There are so many products on the market, many of them similar to each other, that the decision to make a first time purchase can be a difficult process. If we don't know about the product already, we take advice from people who do or we read the magazine reports about it. Without personal recommendation, we rely on advertising and the product's packaging to help us make a buying decision.
In a highly competitive market, the marketing department try to make their products stand out against the rest. A supermarket is a good example of this, with shelves full of almost identical products to choose from. The challenge facing the package designer is how to grab our attention so we make an
Read case studies carefully as the information given will help you structure your answer. Make sure you give the correct number of examples.
Fizz, a soft drinks company, is bringing out a new product, which is a mixture of lime, apple juice and lemonade. They want to target it at school children. Give two factors that they should consider in their packaging, and explain your reasons.
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page
Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it would be a good idea to use bright colours on the packaging.
Surj's answer shows that he only understands the basics of packaging. There is very little detail, and he has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade.
Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging to make sure their product stands out. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging as this has been a very successful way of attracting children in the past.
Saf's answer shows that she understands packaging quite well as she gives good reasons. She could, however, have been a little more detailed and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.
Fizz should make sure their brand name and logo are clearly shown on the packaging to help the consumer recognise their brand and to differentiate the product. This would allow Fizz to take advantage of brand loyalty. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As their target market is schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging and perhaps even a cartoon character, as these have been very successful ways of attracting children in the past.
Marlon's answer is very thorough. He gives good reasons for his suggestions and uses the correct business terms, like 'brand loyalty' and 'differentiate the product'. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.

Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.

Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.

Electron arrangement for a section of the periodic table
the number of shells is the same as the period number.
As you go across each period from left to right the outer shell gradually becomes filled with electrons. The outer shell contains just one electron on the left hand side of the table, but is filled by the time you get to the right hand side.
the number of electrons in the outermost shell is the same as the group number.
Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its outer shell.
to this rule, since although it comes after Group 7 it is not called 'Group 8'; and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.
Working out electronic structure from the Periodic Table
Here's how to use the Periodic Table to work out an electronic structure:
Find the element in the Periodic Table. Work out which period it's in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.
Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements (except helium).
Fill the other circles with electrons (remember: two in the first, eight in the second and third, 18 in the fourth).
Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.
Working out electronic structure from the atomic number
of an atom is the number of
it has. This is the same as the number of electrons. If we know the atomic number we can work out the arrangement of the electrons.
Fill the shells starting from the smallest and going outward.
For example silicon has atomic number 16. So we have to fill the shells with 16 electrons. That makes 2 in the first (to fill it), 8 in the second shell (to fill that) and 6 left to go into the third shell. So silicon has electronic structure 2.8.6

Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.
. The amount of sulfur dioxide given off by a power station can be reduced by:
removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:
Exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles causes atmospheric pollution
burning less fuel by having more efficient engines
using catalytic converters, which convert nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen and oxygen, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide
adjusting the balance between public and private transport, with more people using buses and trains instead of cars

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.

The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

Medical men are well educated, for I do not think that an illiterate man can do the work of a doctor. Even so, at the present time, ignorant amateurs and even worse and more horrible worthless and presumptuous women, grab the profession and abuse it and make mistakes and kill people.

You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are.
Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand
to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word.
Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming.
word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future.
Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.

We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.

keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.
The British Isles have variable weather that changes from day to day between different regions and within different regions. Consequently it is very difficult to predict or forecast the weather.
Britain has four distinct seasons of fairly equal length - spring, summer, autumn and winter. In winter it is colder and wetter and the days are shorter than in summer.
Different parts of the UK experience slightly different regional climates. These can be summarised as:
- cool summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year.
- cool summers, cold winters, steady rain all year.
- warm summers, mild winters, light rain all year, especially summer.
- warm summers, mild winters, heavy rain all year, especially winter.
The variability of weather and climate in different regions of the British Isles is due to the different air masses that meet over the Isles. Each air mass brings with them different characteristics, as shown in the map below.
Prevailing winds and climate zones in the UK
are greatest along the south coast of England (average of 1750 hours of sunshine per year) and are least in mountainous areas (average less then 1000 hours).
Scotland has shorter winter days and longer summer days than the rest of the UK, because it is further north. In the north of Scotland there are four more hours of daylight in mid-summer than in London.
On average it rains one in three days in the UK. However, rainfall varies greatly from region to region. It is generally wetter in the west than the east and wetter in the highlands than the lowlands. The wettest place is Snowdonia in Wales (average annual totals exceeding 3000 mm of rain a year), followed by the Highlands of Scotland, the Lake District, the Pennines and the moors of southwest England.
Parts of the east, such as East Anglia, receive less than 700 mm a year.
In most places in the UK it will rain twice as much in winter months as in summer months. Although in central and south-eastern England, and parts of southeast Scotland, July and August are often the wettest months of the year. In London and Birmingham it will thunder on average 15 days a year, compared to less than 10 elsewhere in the UK.

The coldest months are January and February and the warmest are July and August. In summer Scotland will be about three degrees cooler than England. The average daily maximum temperature at Glasgow in July is 19C compared with 22C in London.
Scotland tends to be worse affected by severe weather than the rest of the UK. Snow is more common in highland regions than in lowland areas, so while snow might fall on the south west of England less than 10 days a year, it will fall on the peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains over 100 days a year.

, and that change in other areas of the economy was much slower  so much so, that one economic historian has argued that the period as a whole no longer deserves the title ""Industrial Revolution"".

Arable farming is common in the south-east where the summers are warm and the land is low, flat and fertile. The south-east also has good transport links and farms are close to markets in towns and cities such as London.
Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

2154,"Species gradually evolve by a process of natural selection. The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.
From left to right - Beagle, Wheaten Terrier, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Red Siberian Husky, Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Boxer, Sheltie
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes
crops that are resistant to certain plant diseases

Motivated workers are more productive and higher
the amount of output achieved for every unit of input used. A productive manufacturing system will produce consistently high quality products with the minimum of wasted time, money or effort
In a service industry, workers who are well motivated will provide a better level of customer service, keeping the customers happy.
Staff who are well motivated are more likely to stay with the company. They grow in experience and become even more valuable to their employer.
If a business successfully keeps the staff it has, the cost of recruiting and training new staff is reduced.
Most people work to satisfy needs of one kind or another.
Things that are offered to employees to motivate them that are not money like training, a gym, holidays etc.
are things other than money that motivate people to work.
based on research about what motivates people to work. He suggested that there were 5 levels of need that influence a person's behaviour.
The need to satisfy the basics to keep us alive ie food, drink and shelter.
The need to satisfy out requirement to feel safe ie protection against danger, threat, deprivation.
The need to be social ie by belonging, by acceptance or friendship.
Things like your reputation or your status.
The need for realising one's own potential for continual self-development eg through training.
In a hierarchy the things at the top are more important than those at the bottom. Maslow said the lower levels (basic needs) have to be satisfied first. Only when these needs have been satisfied will the individual strive to satisfy the higher needs (safety, social, self-esteem and self actualisation). For example, hungry, cold people will seek food and shelter first. Once they are well fed and comfortable, they will turn their attention to higher needs, for example the pleasure of being with colleagues.
How can a business provide for these needs?
A fair wage, a meal and rest facilities.
Job security, safe working conditions, pension schemes.
Met by introducing team work and perhaps providing social facilities like a club or sports pitch.
This is about how others see us at work and can be provided for by rewarding staff with status symbols like cars, offices and new job titles. Allowing staff to gain qualifications at work can boost self-esteem too.
Achieving your full potential. A business must ensure that promotion is possible and that there are opportunities to use initiative.
Money, and the way it is paid, can affect motivation to work. In your exam, you may be asked to calculate wages and bonuses or to compare one type of payment scheme to another. These are some of the most usual payment systems:
Paying by the number of hours worked
Paying by the number of items (pieces) produced.
Extra pay for work done over and above normal working hours. It is usually paid at a higher hourly rate, eg
Usually paid for working unsocial hours such as night work.
A special single payment for achieving a target.
A percentage of the company's profit is shared amongst the workers.
Paying extra money for jobs with difficult hours will usually encourage people to apply for the work.
can be used to persuade workers to stay with their employer for a long period of time. Employees may not want to work longer than their contracted hours but they can often be persuaded to do so by receiving a higher rate of pay.
is a payment in kind. Instead of giving money the employer might provide:
It is often cheaper for the employer to provide goods rather than the money to buy them with. A good perk will make an employee reluctant to leave the business.
Most examinations in this subject are based on a

of a large company. Feedback suggests many of the workers are unhappy and are looking for new jobs. Recent figures show productivity has fallen. You know that the Managing Director has said there will be no wage increases this year. What improvements could you suggest at the next management meeting which would improve motivation and productivity?
A good answer will suggest introducing some of the following things:
Providing a pleasant room for staff to use during breaks.
Providing subsidised meals or improving the existing canteen.
Introducing teamworking and giving teams more say in how things are done.
Introducing a newsletter or regular briefing for all staff.
Rewarding staff with perks like company cars, insurance schemes or discounted goods.
In your answer you will need to show you know about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Apply it to this case study, giving examples of how the company could meet workers' needs at all levels.

6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.
