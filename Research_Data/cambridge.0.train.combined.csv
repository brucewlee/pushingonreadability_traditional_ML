0,12,"Online Literary Criticism For All

Do-it-yourself literary criticism: more than just harmless fun?

From the outset, the idea of open access to the Internet was one of its guiding principles. In theory, anyone could publish a manifesto or broadcast a music channel on the Internet. In practice, however, a certain amount of technical know-how was required, at least in the early years.
However, there was at least one field, previously restricted to the few, that was genuinely opened up to the masses. By visiting the pages of Amazon.com, the first popular online bookshop, anyone was able to try their hand at literary criticism.
Amazon's egalitarian approach to book reviews -- namely, that anyone could say what they liked about anything and award it up to five stars - looked, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. Each book had its own page on Amazon's site, and whenever a reader submitted a new review, it appeared automatically.
This meant that Amazon got to fill its pages with free reviews, and potential buyers of a book could see what other readers thought of it, for better or worse, rather than reading just the blurb from the publisher and the views of professional critics.
Other online bookstores which also operated as large bricks-and-mortar bookshop chains provided similar features. But as the largest player, with over 80% of the online market, Amazon initially had the most customers, attracted by far the greatest number of reviews and, accordingly, encountered the most funny business.
For this critical free-for-all lent itself to subversion of various subtle and not-so-subtle kinds. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day - Amazon would not say exactly how many - so it was impractical to vet them all. Instead, a team of editors scoured the site, checking that reviews conformed to the company's guidelines.
Single-word reviews, for instance, or personal attacks on the author, were not allowed. Nor were reviews that contained obscenities, gave away the ending, or referred to other reviews. Ultimately, however, the reviewers were anonymous (they were not required to give their real names) and offending reviews were removed only if Amazon checkers noticed them. So there was plenty of scope for mischief.
For example, there was nothing to stop writers giving their own books glowing reviews. One writer, Lev Grossman, was so mortified by the bad reviews that readers gave his first novel ('infantile trash', 'puerile pap') that he submitted several anonymous ones of his own ('hilarious', 'fabulous') to redress the balance. His ruse succeeded until he wrote an article detailing his deception. The fake reviews were promptly removed. 
Authors were, in fact, provided with their own way to hold forth: by clicking on a link marked 'I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book.' Most authors who used this feature posted jolly messages expressing their desire that browsers would buy, and enjoy, the book in question. A few even gave their email addresses, thus inviting readers to communicate directly. Yet authors who posted messages knew that while Amazon did vet them, it did not check that they really came from the author.
An exception to this was made in the case of big names. A little-known writer submitted an authors comment, purporting to be from John Updike, in which he admitted to being a 'talented but ultimately over-hyped middlebrow author'. Unsurprisingly, it was deemed a fake and was removed.
Still, the fur really began to fly as a result of postings from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's We've Got Spirit, which documented a year in the life of a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it was well received by the mainstream press. But many of the people mentioned in it felt betrayed, and the books page on Amazon was an obvious outlet for their anger. Dozens of highly critical reviews were submitted - only to vanish a few days later.
Despite this episode, as far as Amazon was concerned, the fact that so many people were prepared to invest so much time reading and writing reviews was simply good for business. As readers' reviews were supposed to be a 'forum to talk about a book' rather than a chat room, a particularly close eye was kept on bestselling books, to ensure that all reviews played by the rules.
This meant that the best place to post a silly review was on a page devoted to a less well-known book. The Story about Ping, a classic children's work that tells the story of a duck called Ping, was the inspiration for much geek humour, because 'ping' also happened to be the name of a software utility used to measure the degree of congestion on the Internet. One lengthy review constructed an elaborate analogy between the books plot and the architecture of the Internet, and concluded that the book provided a 'good high-level overview' of basic networking concepts.
Such silliness was, however, the exception rather than the rule. The striking thing about the vast majority of reader reviews at Amazon.com was how seriously their contributors took them. And overall the reviews collectively provided a remarkably accurate indication of whether or not a particular set of goods was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once complained that 'reviewing too many books involved constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever'.

1,19,"There are some activities that just will not be rushed. They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter.
The mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can he speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot he rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. 'Think fast; we need the results' may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night's rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. 'Look before you leap,' says another. And both are true.
Roughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat - and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of 'intelligence' that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast physical intelligence could be called our 'wits'. (The five senses were originally known as 'the five wits'.)
Then there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an assignment: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence 'intellect'. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call 'bright' or 'clever'. But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative. Perched on a seaside rock, lost in the sound and the motion of the surf, or hovering just on the brink of sleep or waking, we are in a different mental mode from the one we find ourselves in as we plan a meal or dictate a letter. This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones. Allowing the mind time to meander is not a luxury that can safely be cut back as life or work gets more demanding. On the contrary, thinking slowly is a vital part al the cognitive armoury. We need the tortoise mind just as much as we need the hare brain.
Some kinds of everyday predicament are better, more effectively approached with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be penetrated with a relaxed, unquesting mental attitude. Recent scientific study shows convincingly that the more patient, less deliberate modes of mind are particularly suited to making sense of situations that are intricate, shadowy or ill defined. Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are. But when we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose - or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought - we need recourse to the tortoise mind. If the problem is how best to manage a difficult group of people at work, or whether to give up being a manager completely and retrain as a teacher, we may be better advised to sit and ponder than to search frantically for explanations and solutions. This type of intelligence is associated with what we call creativity, or even 'wisdom'.
Poets have always known the limitations of conscious, deliberate thinking, and have sought to cultivate these slower, mistier ways of knowing. Philosophers have written about the realms of the mind that lie beyond and beneath the conscious intellect. It is only recently, however, that scientists have started to explore directly the slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The hybrid discipline of 'cognitive science' is revealing that the unconscious realms of the human mind will successfully accomplish a number of unusual, interesting and important tasks if they are given the time.

2,33,"Blogging: Confessing to the world 

Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins - online announcements of your where-abouts. The site's point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, 'Hey, I'm at this place' - but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere - not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous - and we are lost. 
Depressing? Perhaps, but don't give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity's temptations and perils - all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it's worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the 'WWW', as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once. 
Hall's ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall's site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he'd fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told 'either the blog goes, or I do'. He'd published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, 'it makes people not trust me'. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to 'make people want to be with you', you'll be disappointed. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong's blog to every vice president at her company - including some whom she'd mocked - and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the 'online distribution effect': that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we'd never dream of saying in person. But our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes. 
Armstrong's saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of 'mommy bloggers' and her writing supports her house hold. Once a poster child for the wages of web indiscretion, she has become a virtuoso of managed self-revelation.

3,5,"MUSIC AND THEATRE

Up until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house, I learned that opera is, in fact, only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That's as it should be, of course. But I come from a different world, the world of the theatre, where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy, where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way, and where performer and audience (mostly) speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in concert hall or opera house, there will generally be a substantial minority of people who, like me, have little technical or academic understanding of music. Some of them will be aware of, possibly even embarrassed by, how much they don't know. Most will be awestruck by the skill of the performers. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section are easy to admire. Even a moderately good musician is showing us the results of years of punishingly hard work. Being in the audience for top-class music is not unlike watching an athletics match - we know athletes are doing something broadly similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognise by how much it excess our best efforts.
Theatre audiences by contrast, come with a different set of expectations. In the main they do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually impressed when an actor completes a long and difficult speech (although 'how do you learn all those lines?' is the question every actor gets asked). None of this means that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall, indeed quite a lot of them are the same people. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event. The question is, does music need to learn anything from the theatre about this relationship? I would say yes, partly because I have seen how a different approach can transform the concert-goers experience.
Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, vulnerable to the possibility that something will go unexpectedly wrong, reaching into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective. The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasise the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. On the other hand, the tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity, while it is often a spontaneous expression of appreciation, can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.
Is there anything to be done? Of course a huge amount is being done. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the staging of Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which followed the action from location to location within a cathedral and then out into the town. It was a musical experience of the highest order, in which the skills, and the generosity, of the professional musicians were absolutely central and it was also life-changing for many of the audience, who were not just there to see and hear but also to contribute directly.
Perhaps what I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre at its best can display. Sometimes it can come from the use of unfamiliar or challenging locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. This can have startling effects on performer and audience alike. Comforts may have to be foregone, perhaps the acoustic isn't great, maybe it's a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be intrepid as they follow artists into the most unpromising spaces. I accept that most plays get put on in a pretty uncontroversial way, not greatly different from what happens in a conmen hall. However I remain convinced that something can and should happen to change the conventions of music-going. The only authority I can claim is that of the enthusiast: I love, and live by, the theatre and I spend as much time (and money) as I can going to hear music.

4,52,"Vervet monkeys

Cheney and Seyfarth describe how one day the dominant male in the group of vervet monkeys they were studying noticed a strange male hanging around in a neighbouring grove of trees. The stranger's intentions were quite obvious: he was sizing up the group in order to join it. If he succeeded, it was more than likely that the incumbent male would be ousted from his position of privilege. With the vervet equivalent of a stroke of genius, the male hit on the ideal ploy to keep the stranger away from his group. As soon as the strange male descended from the grove of trees to try to cross the open ground that separated his grove from the one in which the group was feeding, he gave an alarm call that vervets use to signal the sighting of a leopard nearby. The stranger shot back into the safety of his trees. As the day wore on, this was repeated every time the stranger made a move in the groups direction. All was going swimmingly until the male made a crucial mistake: after successfully using the ploy several times, he gave the leopard alarm call while himself nonchalantly walking across open ground.

What Cats Catch

In a recent survey, people in the 173-household English village of Felmersham collected their cats' prey. Over one year their seventy cats produced over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America saw these figures and worked out that on this basis the cat population of Britain must be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year!
The mesmeric effect of big numbers seems to have stultified reason. It is not realistic just to multiply the number of catches of these rural cats by the entire cat population of Britain. Most cats are town cats with small ranges, and catch fewer items of prey than the cats in this survey. The key question should have been this: are the numbers sustainable? The answer would seem to be yes.
In winter many householders feed birds, while garden trees and buildings provide nesting sites, and in this way the bird population is kept at well above 'natural' levels. The survey found that the cat is a significant predator, but not that it is devastating Britain's bird population.

Buffalo's Day

The buffaloes are, as it were, the marshman's lifeline, and they are cherished accordingly. At each dawn the buffaloes, who have been sleeping on the buffalo platform or quite frequently round the fire with their owners, leave, infinitely slowly and wearily, their wallowing progress continually punctuated with despairing groans, for the distant reed beds beyond the open water. For a long time they stand on the edge of the platform, groaning to each other of the infinite fatigue of the coming day, until at last the leader takes a ponderous pace forward and subsides into the water.
Once in the water a deep lassitude once more descends upon the party, as if they had by now forgotten their intention and they may wallow there with low notes of complaint for many minutes. The movements that at length remove them from the immediate vicinity of the house are so gradual as to pass practically unnoticed, but finally they are swimming, so low in the water that their noses seem held above it by a last effort of ebbing strength, their rolling eyes proclaiming that this is the end at last and that they are drowning. So, patient and protesting and more or less submerged, they spend the day among the reeds and the bulrushes, grazing leisurely upon such green shoots as their antediluvian heads may find at eye level.

PICASSO, Pablo 

The soles 1940 Oil on canvas Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art

Picasso tended to paint those things that surrounded him, and in the early spring of 1940, he painted several fish still lifes while he was staying in the fishing port of Royan. The ostensible subject of the painting is a fishmonger's slab with a crab, and a pair of scales containing two or three soles. In spite of their predicament these sea creatures look very much still alive. It is not very easy to read the painting because Picasso has treated the composition in terms of a flat pattern of overlapping and interlocking transparent planes. This, the thin delicately brushed paint, and the cool, undemonstrative colours give the painting the appearance of an underwater world of slow-moving calm and harmony. But this is disturbed by what seems to be an impending battle between the fish, baring their teeth, and the crab, with its open claws. Those sharp, pointed forms are echoed by the scales.

5,32,"POETRY RECITALS

At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. It is fairly safe to say that, at the present time, there is an especially bewildering complexity of poetic tendencies, of kinds of poetry being written, of warring factions, of ways of presenting, criticising and teaching poetry, and of conflicting beliefs about the role of the poet in society. 
Very broadly speaking, the present debate in contemporary poetry concerns the reciprocal mistrust and disapproval shown by the seriously committed 'literary' writers, whose poems are intended to be printed and read on the page, and the 'popular', performing poets who, while they will probably publish their verses in magazines and collections, are happier declaiming them to an audience. Of course, this division is far from absolute.
The practice of promoting public poetry readings has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years or so, in many different forms. Small literary societies in provincial towns conduct them in village halls or the sitting rooms of their members; schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students; arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events, and of poets being more or less obliged to become public performers, are manifold and of uncertain benefit to them as mists.
For the 'pop' poets, whose work has been composed expressly for the purpose of recital to live audiences, the issue is plain. They can only profit from public performance. Their verses are often very simple in both form and content, and can be assimilated at a single hearing; it is on the printed page that the deficiencies of thought, technique and imagination become clear. Poets who are dedicated to their craft, and are doing their best to continue and develop what is finest in the traditions of poetry - which involves compressing the maximum amount of passion, thought, wit and vision into the smallest possible space and achieving rhythmic effects of great variety and subtlety -- are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience which is probably encountering their work for the first time. The danger here is, not that they will be tempted to emulate the content and style of the entertainers, but that they might, in the effort to achieve instant communication, read only their most readily accessible work which is quite likely to be their slightest and least characteristic. 
Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct. To hear good poets read their work aloud, even if they are not accomplished public speakers, is a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken. The principal justification for popular recitals of poetry, where the readings are sometimes interspersed with musical items (jazz and poetry used to be a very popular mixture), is that audiences will come to associate poetry with pleasure and not feel that it is an art available only to an initiated minority.

There is something very elemental and satisfying about our relationship with food. I know
I may be preaching to the converted, because presumably people keen on cooking buy cookery books like this one, but so often we imagine that, unless it is some special occasion or an especially elaborate dish, it is hardly worth attempting. Not so. Just by throwing a few roughly chopped carrots, a leek, some celery and a few herbs into water you will get the most delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or opening a tin. Instead of buying an over-sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, emulsifiers and additives, in five minutes you can turn out the most delicious confection that both grown-ups and children will love.
Cooking is also an offering, and it is a gesture of care and love to bring once own creation, however humble or simple, to the table. Sharing food is so rich in symbolism, of our deepest human needs, that it is hardly surprising all our festivities and celebrations take place around tables, be they birthdays, anniversaries, engagements or whatever! No one would have a takeaway for a wedding or anniversary party! Nor would many people wish to have a business deal discussed over tinned soup.

In the Elevator

This morning, Alistair had made a stab at straightening up his office, but correspondence still littered every surface. Quarterly tax forms, state and federal, bulged out of desk drawers and cardboard boxes, all waiting on a day when he was in the filing mode. And then there was all the added paperwork that went along with owning an apartment building. The hundred-odd books and a few years' worth of journals were only in proximity to the new bookshelves.
As the elevator bore him closer to his floor, he knew that Mallory would be on time for their appointment. She would be knocking on the door of his empty office on the hour, not a second before or after. She was as compulsive about time as she was about neatness.
How would she react to the mess? She might assume he'd been vandalised. He could walk in behind her and feign shock.
Mrs Wilson, his cleaning woman, had arrived while he was scrambling around on the floor, trying desperately to clear a few square feet of the carpet. Putting his head out of the office door as she was turning her key in the lock of his apartment, he had smiled at her, his eyes filled with hope. Her own eyes had turned hard. Fat chance I'm going in there, said the back of her head as she had disappeared into his residence, which was her territory and all that she might be held accountable for.
He knew Mrs Wilson believed him to be a visitor from somewhere else, perhaps some point straight up, miles out, but nowhere on the surface of her own earth, which was square and shaped by the streets of Brooklyn.

KAREN

It was a simple desire - not to be like her mother - that led Karen to create her own story, her own mythology, a mythology of difference and strength. Tn the tale that she constructed for herself, there were significant moments in her progress; such as the day she was twelve years old and her brother quick-swung a golf club behind him and hit her full in the eye. At the first moment of impact, she was convinced of immediate blindness. But the bone hod protected her, as the doctor from the high-walled house later assured her. The golf club had clean missed the eye and she was left with only a few stitches that healed to a pole drawing of past suffering. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's white-walled consulting room, overlooking the tennis courts, ond saw her mother clear before her, muttering predictably and paradoxically about both miracles and small mercies, she knew that she was saved for some purpose.

Miss Fogerty

Miss Fogerty, returning briskly to her duties across the wet grass of the village green, was both excited and saddened by the scene she had just witnessed. It is always exhilarating to be the first to know something of note, particularly in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's quiet life held little excitement. On the other hand, her grief for Dr Bailey's condition was overwhelming. He has attended her for many years and she remembered with gratitude his concern for her annual bouts of laryngitis which were, fortunately, about the only troubles for which she had to consult him.
His most valuable quality, Miss Fogerty considered, was his making one feel that there was always plenty of time, and that he truly wished to hear about his patients' fears and perplexities. It was this quality, above all others, which had so endeared the good doctor to the village and its environs. He had always been prepared to give -- of his time, of his knowledge, and of his humour.

7,50,"Vancouver

In the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada. To relax in the evening, residents stroll down the city streets and, if you join them, you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. People come to Vancouver for its mild climate, its wonderful setting between the ocean and the mountains, its clean and safe environment and its educational and job opportunities. And much as some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have sprung up, there's no doubt that the new arrivals and flourishing tourism industry have helped fuel an urban renaissance. Locals once referred to Vancouver as 'Terminal City' because of the city's role as a terminus or gateway to all other places. Though the name has fallen slightly out of favour, Vancouver is more a gateway than ever.

Putting Pen to Paper

Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it said that this is because of the instinctive distaste we feel at writing something we are not going to be paid for, but I cannot believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that since in our work, we are always striving to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter escapes us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may rewrite a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem. I believe that it is in this inherent grasp of the effect of his words that there lies the only sure test of the real artist. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines he surely never thought consciously that it was the contrast between polysyllables that made them so effective, as well as showing him to be a great writer.

Supermarket Opening

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely on a soap star, a disc jockey or a minor member of the royal family to come down and cut the ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are popping up every day in many areas and so the poor old celebrity has become superfluous. Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of Superbuy, so long as they were at the front. According to one prospective customer who knew someone who worked there, the first five men over the threshold would be getting a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers.

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.

Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals, rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.
To economists, this ceremony is peculiar, because in most places it is free. Yes, households pay for the service out of local taxes but the family that fills four bins with rubbish each week pays no more than the elderly couple that fills one.
Yet the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero at all. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local authorities have to pay in landfill and tipping fees. This looks like the most basic of economic problems: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish.
The obvious solution is to make households pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. That will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more (assuming that local governments provide collection points for suitable materials).
But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, have found, what appears to be the logical approach to an everyday problem has surprisingly intricate and sometimes disappointing results.
Research focused on several American towns and cities which, in the past few years, have started charging households for generating rubbish. The commonest system is to sell stickers or tags which householders attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up in the weekly collection. 
In a paper published last year Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman concentrated on the effects of one such scheme, introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may sound like sensible use of market forces. In fact, the authors conclude, the schemes benefits did not cover the cost of printing materials, the commissions to sellers and the wages of the people running the scheme.
True, the number of bags or cans did fall sharply, by 37%. But this was largely thanks to the 'Seattle stomp', a frantic dance first noticed when that distant city introduced rubbish pricing. Rather than buy more tags, people simply crammed more garbage - about 40% more -- into each container by jumping on it if necessary.
As we all know, such compacting is done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals, however enthusiastically. The weight of rubbish collected (a better indicator of disposal costs than volume) fell by a modest 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities where no pricing scheme was in place, and which were used as a rough-and-ready control group, it fell by 3.5% in any case.
Less pleasing still, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay to have their rubbish removed. This is hard to measure directly but the authors guess that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.
The one bright spot in the whole experience seems to have been a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay to have their refuse carted away. But the fee may have little to do with the growth in recycling, as many citizens were already participating in Charlottesville's voluntary scheme.
In a more recent study, Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman explore the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish - but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts quantity only by 0.3%.
This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it so surprising? To reduce their output of rubbish by a lot, people would have to buy less of just about everything. A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference.
If that's the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and they have less time for recycling.
Should we conclude that the idea of charging households for the rubbish they produce is daft? Not at all: free disposal after all is surely too cheap. But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out.

9,1,"Surviving in a Foreign Land

I have been welcomed warmly. It's a sociable and well-provisioned base camp in a very, very isolated place. At any one time, there are some forty odd souls - scientists, students, weathermen, satellite trackers -- in a close-knit community where everyone mucks in. My school French is proving adequate - just -- to communicate, but not to chat or banter. I miss the nuances, and my phrasebook is useless at breakfast.
There is no practical problem for me in this, but initially there was a problem of self-confidence. I found myself slightly dreading mealtimes. I would hang back, worried about which table to choose terrified at the silence which fell when I spoke, anxious in a way I cannot remember since the first weeks of school. I still grin inanely, or panic when people talk to me. I suspect the cause of this occasional depression is nothing to do with loss of company or communication, it's because
I've lost the social predominance which my own gift of the gab has always afforded me.

Elliot

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like any other and he took no notice of me. He never forgot a face though, and when I ran across him here or there he shook hands with me cordially, but showed no desire to further our acquaintance; and if I saw him at the opera, say, he being with a person of high rank, he was inclined not to catch sight of me. But then I happened to make a somewhat startling success as a playwright, and presently I became aware that Elliot regarded me with a warmer feeling. One day, I received a note from him asking me to lunch and I conceived the notion that he was trying me out. But from then on, since my success had brought me many new friends, I began to see him more frequently.

Alfred Hitchcock

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that he didn't care about the subject matter of his films, or indeed about the acting, but that he did care about the photography and the soundtrack and all the technical ingredients. For Hitchcock, it wasn't a message that stirred the audience, nor was it a great performance, he believed that people are aroused by pure film, irrespective of their cultural background. Therefore, if a picture is designed correctly, in terms of its emotional impact, the Japanese audience should scream at the same moment as the Indian audience.
Hitchcock's self-appraisal was always precise, rational, deceptively unanswerable, he was a man of reason and a craftsman of genius who liked to hear an audience scream. He didn't deal in speculation, abstraction or intellectual allusion, and his assessment of his own screen characters was not exploratory.

10,23,"CRYING 

Charles Darwin thought that the human tendency to cry had no obvious evolving purpose. He was almost certainly wrong. More recently scientists have pointed to its social significance, with psychiatrist John Bowlby highlighting the role of crying in developing the attachment between mother and child. Many believe that tears, at least during childhood, are mainly an expression of helplessness. However, the persistence of crying into adulthood is harder to explain. It seems that the sound of crying becomes considerably less important than the visual signal it conveys. It may have been advantageous to early human communities as a means of promoting trust and social connectedness. 
Tears can undoubtedly have other causes too. We may cry to express sympathy for those suffering terrible injustice. Furthermore, tears can be shed involuntarily, rather to our embarrassment, when we hear inspiring music or moving speeches. We may cry when watching a sentimental film, but interestingly, this is more likely to occur in company than when we are alone.

We've all heard of global warming, but just how much warmer will the earth get and how will it affect our lives?

Almost everyone has some idea of what global warming is all about, but no one is quite sure about its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to mean changes to the weather in all parts of the world. And since the atmosphere is intimately linked every aspect of the planet on which we live, any changes to climate will have significant knock-on effects for plants and animals, as well as water and soils.
We humans have learned to use such natural resources to our advantage, enabling us to produce food, build great cities and support six billion members of the human race. Any changes to these resources have to be taken seriously. The problem we have is knowing just how the world will change, and what is causing these changes.
There is no doubt, for example, that over the last 100 years or so, human action has significantly increased the atmospheric concentrations of several gases -- which are closely related to global temperature. It seems likely that these increased concentrations, which are set to continue building up in the near future, are already affecting global climate, but our poor knowledge and understanding of the global heat balance make the current and future situations uncertain. What we do know is that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have fluctuated in close harmony with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years.
This would indicate that the two are almost certainly related. Evidence gleaned from a range of sources suggests that our planet has warmed at the surface by about 6C over the past century. Most scientists think that this trend is unlikely to be natural in origin and is, in part, a result of human pollution of the atmosphere.
A lot of research has gone into predicting the conditions that will result from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs known as general circulation models, or GCMs. They run on powerful computers, use fundamental laws of physics and chemistry to analyse the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation and other climatic factors to predict climatic condition for the past, present or future.
Unfortunately, they are simplifications of the real would and have numerous deficiencies. Their results are only approximate and they are also slow to run and expensive to use. Part of the problem is that we do not understand fully all the processes of the climatic system, although we do realise its complexity.
Despite these research difficulties, most people agree on perhaps the most important aspect of climatic change from the viewpoint of contemporary human societies: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have previously experienced. In this case, the approximate predictions produced by GCMs are being used to gain some insight into the nature and conditions of the world that we will inhabit over the next few generations.
Currently, they suggest that the average annual global surface temperature will increase by between 1C and 3.5C by the year 2100; that the average sea level around the world will rise by 15-95 cm; and that changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, floods and droughts, to become more frequent in some places.
These forecasts should leave us in little doubt about the potential impact of climatic change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate have the potential to affect the geographical locations of ecological systems, such as forests and grasslands, the mix of species they contain and their ability to provide the various benefits on which societies depend for their continued existence. Thus, the whole range of resources on which we rely is sensitive to changes in climate. This includes food production, water resources and human settlements. The effects, some of which are potentially irreversible, are likely to be unfavourable in many areas.
But this would not be true for all. In fact, some climate change impacts will probably be beneficial. Scientists in some countries have already identified useful environmental trends that are closely linked to the warming that has occurred to date. In Australia, for example, research has shown that the average yield of wheat has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, and climate trends have played a significant part in this greater food production.
The most important climatic factor observed in this case was the rise, in recent decades, of the minimum temperature. Among other things, the warmer temperatures have meant fewer frosts, and this has caused less damage to harvests. 
However, many of the predicted effects of future climate warming are far from beneficial. Relatively small changes in climate can influence the availability of water, either due to long-term dying of the climate or by increasing the frequency of droughts. Associated problems are likely to arise first in arid and semi-arid regions and more humid areas where demand or pollution have already created shortages.
The Mediterranean Basin is one example of this and in recent decades decreasing trends in precipitation totals have already been identified in western-central parts of the basin as well as marked changes in seasonality. A clear tendency for rainfall to be concentrated into a shorter period of the year has been noted in the Alentejo region of southern Portugal, with the proportion of annual rainfall falling in autumn and winter, increasing at the expense of spring totals.
A further undesirable effect is likely to be changes to glacial processes. This will impact on glacier ice, ground ice and sea ice, which in turn will affect vegetation, wildlife habitats and human structures and facilities. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that the Arctic's ice cover will melt completely, making marine transport and oil and gas exploration easier but increasing the danger from icebergs.
But probably the most dramatic and visible effect of global warming is the twenty-first or 'greenhouse' century will be the rise in sea levels. This will be caused by the thermal expansion of the ocean -- warmer water occupies a greater volume than cold water -- and the added input from melting ice. With scientists calculating that about half of the world's population live in coastal zones, the consequences of rising sea levels are potentially very severe.
Increased flooding and inundation are the most obvious results, with London, New York and Tokyo being just a few of the candidates for significant disruption. Huge numbers of people stand to lose their homes and livelihoods and this could produce many millions of environmental refugees.
Arguably the most severe consequences would be experienced by several small, low-lying island states, since entire countries could cease to exist if worst-case scenarios are realised.

A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. 'I'm a little dinosaur,' he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme, so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not a lot.
There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son. The father diligently read the words while the son fiddled with the pictures. 'Had he spent ten minutes in front of a book, he might possibly have learned something,' said his father.
Television, as my son and his noodles demonstrate, is an impressionistic, suggestive medium. Research about television and learning shows that learning goes on in a learning environment where dialogue is taking place with teachers or parents. It needs to be mediated. There is nothing wrong with harnessing new technology to teach our children, but there is still a big role for formal education.

Hollywood

By 1918, four-fifths of the film-making capacity of the world had relocated to Hollywood. Locals disapproved, seeing their suburb of Los Angeles infected by these new vulgarians. But in the end snobbery yielded to the true American value, success. And success is the box-office gross. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: one that may make a star, but must make somebody's fortune.
In less than a century, Hollywood has grown from a toffee-nosed village to a town as famous as New York, Rome or Paris. And physically, of course, it has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet in a way, it is still a village - parochial, with limited horizons - just a little bit of Los Angeles. For all who live and work in it, there is one topic of conversation - films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who's been stabbed in the back, who is 'attached' to which project. Those who have been successful often try to get away: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet it is still the one place in the world to which almost everyone who is anyone in show-business (and plenty who agent) eventually gravitates.

Photography

Photography was invented by nineteenth century artists as an art form for their own purposes. These men were seeking a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings and they found it. The new combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and flat surface coated with chemicals sensitive to light produced images more lasting, more convincing in their reality, and more richly detailed than painters could produce manually in weeks and months of effort. This alone was enough to throw consternation into the ranks of fellow artists; and, after their first reaction of pleasure in a new kind of image, art critics rallied with the haughty charge that photography was not, and could not be, an art. The actual world in which we live had too strong a grip on photography, they said, and pictures so dependent upon mechanical means could not be called acts of man's creative imagination.
Despite the critics, photographers knew that they had found a new art form, a new mode of expression. They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.

Book Illustration

During the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children's book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work.

13,59,"Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as 'So Low', a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I've never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn't prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I'm only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get.

14,38,"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I'd come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren't quite the string of triumphs I'd foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn't sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I'd done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I'd given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I'd also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I'd delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn't meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute's role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren't great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn't have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I'd last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn't even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn't even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn't wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn't figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don't lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever.

In modern times - more and more over the course of the last two hundred years - we have come to speak as though every artist had to rebel against the art of his contemporaries. Art is praised in terms of being unique, revolutionary, shocking even. We feel good about admiring the artist whose work no one appreciated a hundred years ago. But when we get to the art of our own day, we get cold feet and say that an artist has gone too far, that what he does can no longer be called art. Or, rather, the media say it for us. And, on the whole, we agree because we expect to be puzzled by art's insistent newness - so much so that we do not notice the old themes, methods and also virtues that the art of our own time is full of.
We require artists to be separate from the rest of us, figures with special talents and drive, so vigorous that conventions cannot contain them. Previous ages went to artists with commissions: people needed art for specific purposes, and it was part of their ordinary life. Today we leave artists to their own devices and get rather cross with them if they want to come down out of the clouds.

Picture This

I am going to describe a situation, and then ask a crucial question about it. I hope it doesn't strike you as unduly gnomic. But if it does, that's modern art for you.
Here's the situation. An artist chooses a piece of text in an art book. The text considers the diversity of pictures. 'What are they all about?' it asks dumbly, before deciding, even more dumbly: 'There is no end, in fact, to the number of different kinds of pictures.' Okay, this is kiddy-language, and so far all it has betrayed is kiddy-thinking. But stick with me, all you adults out there. The situation is about to complicate itself.
Having settled on his text, the man then asks someone else to make a canvas for him, to stretch it and prime it, and then to take it along to a sign painter. He asks the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas. And he gives the sign painter specific instructions not to attempt anything flashy or charming with the lettering. The sign painter does all this. On a white canvas, in simple black letters, he writes the chosen text. So my crucial question is this: is the finished product a painting?

Underground Encounters

At the Mercury Gallery, London until 26th June

It is an unspoken rule of commercial success as a painter that once you have developed a profitable line in one genre, you stick to it. Collectors expect an artist to diligently mine the same seam, and attempts to strike out in a new direction are usually met at best with indignation and the feeling that the artist has let the public down.
Why this should be I'm not entirely sure. Gallery owners obviously prefer safe bets, and perhaps the art-buying public is insecure and needs the comfort of continuity. A few artists break the mould and get away with it. Picasso and Hockney are two prime examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now gamely running contrary to form, and it remains to be seen if he can pull it off. His new show takes the daring step of swapping the pristine still lifes which have made his name for paintings of the world of the London Underground.
Railways hold a peculiar charm for Rimmington. From drawings made in the 1980s of the railway land of Londons Kings Cross Station, it was a logical step to go beneath the ground and look at what was happening below. The sketches have provided the material for Underground Encounters, an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings which convey the curious magic of this sunken world designed for a population in transit.

Extract from a novel

I have escaped to this island with a few books. I do not know why I use the word 'escape'. The villagers say jokingly that only a sick man would choose such a remote place to rebuild. Well then, I have come here to heal myself, if you like to put it that way.
Apart from the wrinkled old peasant who comes from the village on her mule each day to clean the house, I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I lie suspended like a hair or a feather in the cloudy mixtures of memory. I spoke of the uselessness of art but added nothing truthful about its consolations. The solace of such work as I do with brain and heart lies in this - that only there, in the silences of the painter or the writer can reality be reordered, reworked and made to show its significant side. Our common actions in reality are simply the sackcloth covering which hides the cloth-of-gold - the meaning of the pattern. For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life; in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination.

Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, and the chances are they'll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations, from computers to encyclopaedias.
Most people know little of what Einstein did, except that he developed some mysterious theories under the heading 'relativity', which are famous for being incomprehensible, and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience.
Einstein was part of a gigantic leap forward in scientific thinking, an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature.
Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy. Previous descriptions had depended on Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

Young Readers

Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would be worthy; and for 'worthy', read 'boring', we thought.
While our mother had been inclined to abhor our philistinism in tones of despising innuendo, our father would cheerfully dish us out tenpences, chapter by chapter, as inducements to make us cast our eyes over the occasional improving volume. Or he would slip the odd superior book in amongst our Christmas and birthday presents, labelled in bold marker pen, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Though we dismissed most of his offerings as 'boys' books', he did, in this way, expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.

Language

'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous', wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. The marvellous secret has long proved a launch pad for strange ideas. 'Primitive man was likely to make sounds like ""meuh"" when sensing danger,' claimed Charles Caller in 1928. ""Meuh"" has a plaintive sound. The human who wandered over a hostile land inhabited by awesome beasts uttered desperate noises, and languages have preserved some echo of his lamentation such as malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"".
Faced with such weird speculations, many avoided the topic, regarding it as a playground for cranks, but recently, language origin and evolution have become key research areas. Language probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles.

17,20,"The Actor's Craft

Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they're compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' But instead they all too easily fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. We should all pay heed to what Paul Scofield said in a letter to a friend of mine: 'I have found that an actor's work has life and interest only in its execution. It seems to wither away in discussion and become emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It has no rules (except perhaps audibility). With every play and every playwright the actor starts from scratch, as if he or she knows nothing and proceeds to learn afresh every time growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer. When the play has finished its run, he's empty until the next time. And its the emptiness which is, I find, apparent in any discussion of theatre work.'

A review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester's Hamlet is poised precariously between boyhood and manhood, and it is a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His handling of the text and his physical and psychological self-control take him, in one leap, from brilliantly promising to frontline player: an actor with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester plays an edgy, tetchy young man who feeds on a banked-down sense of anger, agile, watchful and driven, he deploys a sense of acid wit and generous humour that makes him both formidable and lovable. Although played down, the virtuosity of this performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester's body, the way his arms hang stiffly, giving you a sense of a figure waiting to be animated. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives you a similar feeling of a body being moved by an inner force that he both knows and does not know. So what is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? Who and what animates these bodies, morally and physically? That is the central question about the life of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal

The first stage of this director's rehearsal process is known as 'dropping in', a procedure which goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, finding out what effect the words are having. When if is their turn to speak, they glance of the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak. For example, the line is, 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?; Breathe. Let the thought drop in with your breath. A memory, a vision, an impression. Some people will imagine a queue, maybe at a bus stop on the way to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. Having visualised the scene, find the impulse to speak it - what this director calls 'The pathway to the line'. Impulses can come from without or within. Look in the eyes of the other actor listening. Consider your character's situation. This director talks of 'dropping in' as a means of finding out what is going on. Don't pre-plan or pre-judge. Dare to go down there with an empty mind and trust that something will happen to you.

The Perfect Theatre

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. Going to the theatre, going to any live performance, is an event and the staff need to have a sense of that, too. It's terribly alienating if you feel that its just any old job for the people working front of house.
The theatre itself needs to create a relationship between the performer and the audience - no one in the audience should feel that they're getting an unreasonably prejudiced view of the actor. It's important that they're not too far away, they can hear, they can see, they can feel in some sense in contact with what's going on on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it because you can't deny the human form at the heart of drama. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.
I like theatres that have a sense of the past in them. Like worn stone steps in a church, you get the sense of layers of human presence. From the point of view of the plays, you can't have something for everybody. You cant second-guess an audience because they don't know what they're going to want to see.

18,57,"Paul Simon

Rock and roll in the 1950s was primarily a youth cult, but its lasting importance lay in the seismic impact it had on the middle class and the middle-aged. It also paved the way for the next generation of rock idols, who listened to it awestruck and aware that this strange, unsettling sound would somehow, irrevocably, be linked with their destinies.
For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief opportunity for hearing this new and invigorating type of music that was sweeping the country was courtesy of Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was required listening for a whole generation of fledgling rock idols. Like the young John Lennon, 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, with his ear glued to Radio Luxembourg - the only European outlet for the new rock and roll - Paul Simon was fascinated by the sounds pouring from Freed's show, and prepared himself for the next big step for a rock and roll obsessed teenager, the switch from listening to others' music to making his own.

Snow

No path was visible, but I thought that I would be all right if I walked with due caution. The wind hammered down from the heights, knocking me over as I slid and slithered on the slippery ice. Suddenly the innocent-looking snow gave way beneath me. I dropped, startled, into a hole some four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, melting away to leave nothing but a thin crust through which I had plunged. I hauled myself out, shaken and unnerved, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat back against the top of a pine tree that protruded from the snow to take stock of the situation. In an hour I had covered about half a mile. It was perfectly clear that I would have to abandon my plan.

Qualitative Research

There are now numerous books which attempt to give guidance to researchers about qualitative research. While much has been written about the collection of data, the books are often silent about the processes and procedures associated with data analysis. Indeed, much mystery surrounds the way researchers analyse their data. Accordingly, we invited a range of social scientists who have engaged in qualitative projects to discuss the approaches that they used. The idea was to share insight and understanding of the process of qualitative data analysis rather than to produce a guidebook for the intending researcher. Such a task involves a process of demystification, of making implicit procedures more explicit. While this may sound straightforward, we have found it far from simple.

19,6,"Air-conditioning

There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym, a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so, in fact, that at quiet times, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. This is just one example of how the modern world casually misuses air-conditioning. It has become a central feature of work and play, a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate, or at least modify it.
Many air-conditioned buildings, however, could employ other methods of cooling. They could take advantage of daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night. These measures may sound obvious, but they can have telling results and would considerably reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It is surely more than coincidence that the beginning of a new millennium is being accompanied by renewed interest in sundials: instruments used to measure time according to the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were a vital time-keeping device, essential for anyone who hoped to keep their clocks working accurately. Then, as clocks and watches became more sophisticated and reliable, the sundial was relegated to the status of garden ornament - a romantic and intriguing ornament, but nonetheless an anachronism, in a brave new technological age. Now the clock has been turned back and they are again being taken seriously.
David Harber, a sundial maker, believes that their appeal lies in their direct link with the planets. He says that when he delivers one, there is a moment of magic when it starts working. They are still, calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the cosmos.

Paint Your Own China

My image of china-painting stemmed from a visit, long ago, to an arts and crafts exhibition where stern-looking grey-haired ladies demonstrated how to cover a teacup with delicate flowers using a series of deft brushstrokes. The spectacle was riveting, because each stroke formed a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands never wobbled, the paint never smudged, and the observer might have concluded that these women had either been practising their art for decades or had been born with an extraordinary talent for steady precision.
Mindful of this experience, I wondered what kind of people would have the courage to enrol on a course in china-painting. Would even the beginners display an intuitive artistry? In fact, the atmosphere turned out to be far from intimidating.

20,54,"Sand

Much as I admire sands miraculous ability to be transformed into useful objects like glass and concrete, I am not a great fan of it in its natural state. To me it is primarily a hostile barrier that stands between a seaside car park and the water itself. It blows in your face, gets in your sandwiches, and swallows vital objects like car keys and coins. When you are wet it adheres to you like 'stucco', and cannot be shifted, even with a fireman's hose. But, and here's the strange thing, the moment you step onto a beach towel, climb into a car or walk across a recently vacuumed carpet, it pours off you. For days afterwards, you tip mysteriously undiminishing piles of it onto the floor every time you take on your shoes, and spray the vicinity with lots more when you peel off your socks. Sand stays with you for longer than many contagious diseases. No, you can keep sand, as far as I am concerned.

Lock and Key

The search for a safe home, for privacy and security, has existed ever since human beings first built a permanent homestead. The rope-lifted beam behind the door may have given way to an electronic lock triggered by a plastic card with more combinations than there are atoms in the universe, but the urge to shut out the 'bad guys' remains. The appeal of a lock and key is, to some extent, psychological. Recently, various companies have experimented with computerised locking systems, where smart cards, swiped through a 'reader', control electronic locks by means of a digital command. But people don't like them. You may be prepared to put up with it at work, but at home, everyone wants the reassurance of turning a physical key in a lock. As a result, when one locksmith company developed a new electronic system, they made sure they incorporated a proper metal key into the device.

Modern Art

I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery as, like many people, I can make head nor tail of modern art. I know I quite like some of it, furry things in particular, neon light sculptures and massive photographs. Perhaps if I were better informed about it, I'd have an opinion on more things. There again, yours not meant to set about it in a school-essay way. The point is not to grasp art, but to let it communicate with you. This is a splendid idea but one that never worked for me in practice. But this new gallery has tried to give the visitor a genuine insight into the whys and wherefores of the works. The first thing I noticed were the labels, proper labels that set a work in context and actually told you what it was trying to say.

21,49,"The Wrong Country

Uncle chose for them a package holiday at a very reasonable price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the fairyland city, in the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went together to the travel agency to make the booking, the counter clerk explained that the other members of that particular package were a school group from the south coast, all of them learning Italian. But something went wrong.
Either in the travel agency or at the check-in desk, or in some anonymous computer, a small calamity was conceived. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick they had handed their tickets to a girl in the yellow-and-red Your-Kind-of-Holiday uniform. She'd addressed them by name, had checked the details on their tickets and said that that was lovely. An hour later it had surprised them to hear elderly people on the plane talking in North of England accents. Keith said there must have been a cancellation, or possibly the Italian class was on a second plane.
They ordered two drinks, and then two more. 'The coach'll take us on,' a stout woman with spectacles announced when they touched down. 'Keep all together now.' There's been no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach drew in at its destination, Keith explained that that was clearly what this was. As they stepped out of the coach it was close on midnight: fatigued and travel-stained, they did not feel like questioning their right to the beds they were offered.
But the next morning, when it became apparent that they were being offered them for the duration of their holiday, they became alarmed.
'We have the lake, and the water birds,' the receptionist smilingly explained. 'And we may take the steamer to Interlaken.'
'An error has been made,' Keith informed the man, keeping the register of his voice even, for it was essential to be calm. He was aware of his wive's agitated breathing close beside him.
'We were meant to be in Venice. In the Pensione Concordia.'
'I do not know the name, sir. This is Switzerland.'
'A coach is to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night, that woman.'
'Your group is booked twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. To make an alteration now, sir, if you have changed your minds -'
'We haven't changed our minds. Theres been a mistake.'
The receptionist shook his head. He did not know about a mistake.
'The man who made the booking,' Dawne interrupted, 'was bald, with glasses and a moustache.' She gave the name of the travel agency in London.
'Some problem, have we?' a woman said, beaming at Keith. She was the stout woman he had referred to as an official. They'd seen her talking to the yellow-and-red girl at Gatwick. On the plane she'd walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people.
'My name is Franks,' she was saying now. 'I'm married to the man with the bad leg.'
'Are you in charge, Mrs Franks?' Dawne enquired. 'Only we're in the wrong hotel.'
Again she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald-headed counter clerk, mentioning his spectacles and his moustache. Keith interrupted her. 'It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it all to her.'
'We should have known when they weren't from Dover,' Dawne contributed. 'We heard them talking about Darlington.'
Keith made an impatient sound. He wished sh'ed leave the talking to him.
'We noticed you at Gatwick,' Keith said. 'We knew you were in charge of things.'
'And I noticed you. I counted you, although I daresay you didn't see me doing that. Now, let me explain to you. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients to, many different holidays at different prices. There are, for instance, villa holidays for the adventurous under-thirty-fives. There are treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas.'
'Now, what I am endeavouring to say to you good people is that all tickets and labels are naturally similar, the yellow with the two red bands.' Mrs Franks suddenly laughed. 'So if you simply followed other people with the yellow-and-red label you might imagine you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,' she added soothingly, 'that couldn't happen in a million years.'
'We're not meant to be in Switzerland,' Keith doggedly persisted.
'Well, let's just see, shall we?'
Unexpectediy, Mrs Franks turned and went away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer behind the reception desk. The sound of typing could be heard.
'She seems quite kind,' Dawne whispered, 'that woman.' Keith wasn't listening. He tried to go over in his mind every single thing that had occurred: handing the girl the tickets, sitting down to wait, and then the girl leading the way to the plane, and then the pilot's voice welcoming them aboard, and the air hostess with the smooth black hair going round to see that everyone's seat belt was fastened.
'Nice to have some young people along,' an elderly man's voice interrupted Keith's thoughts. 'Nottage the name is.' The old man's wife was with him, both of them looking as if they were in their eighties. They'd slept like logs, she said, best night's sleep they'd had for years, which of course would be due to the lakeside air.
'Thats nice,' Dawne said.
Keith walked out of the reception area and Dawne followed him. On the forecourt of the hotel they didn't say to one another that there was an irony in the catastrophe that had occurred. On their first holiday since their honeymoon they'd landed themselves in a package tour of elderly people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly.

I was ushered into the young man's drawing room, an oasis of cultured sanity surrounded by what appeared to be a quite shambolic cluster of rooms in which the less enterprising members of the family operated. Moving from the kitchen to his parlour was an upgrade from economy to business class.
Here was the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had come across and the astonishing evidence that a teenager existed who had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures and furniture.
His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to read history, and he had nine months to kill before going up, during which time he intended to become England's answer to the composer Richard Rodgers.
My own ambitions were just as insane as his, I wanted to be a pop star, for all the healthy reasons women, money and fame. The difference between Andrew and myself was that my dreams were never life or death to me, though it's easy to say that now. They might have become so had I failed.
Consequently, when Andrew suggested a completely new insane ambition for me, i.e. to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein, I had no qualms about giving it a go. This was partly because within ten minutes of our introduction, he was at the piano and had played me three tunes he had composed -- I could tell that he was good. Very good.
As he confidently continued to bash out selections from some of the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of many of the best show albums from my parents LP collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world.
I had little to impress him with in return, other than instant praise for his music and a bona fide, actually released, seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) with which an unknown pop group had dealt the final blow to their moribund career by recording three months previously. We parted, promising to meet again and to write something together. I was still more interested in the charts than in the West End theatre, but told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met somebody of rare ability and determination, and I would be mad to miss out on being a sidekick to a chap who was clearly going to take the musical theatre by storm, probably by next week.
And even if the two of us failed to challenge the top musical composers successfully, then we could try to knock the Beatles and Rolling Stones off their perches later, in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would clearly be in need of some new material.
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to become a solicitor, the brief certainty I had enjoyed of a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded somewhat. I would of course continue to keep an eye on the small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist, and would turn out a few more three-chord songs tailored not to expose the limitations of my voice, but it was still odds-on that eventually I would stagger through my exams and wind up a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five.
By then I would have surely grown out of pop music as my father had confidently predicted I would by the time I was twenty-one. This was worrying - if he was right I only had a few more months of enjoying it.
But in the meantime I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go and see a musical with him, to write words that aped musical lyricists rather than pop stars. And Andrew was a fascinating individual who talked of Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, besides supporting Leyton Orient football team.
I wasn't convinced by the idea for a musical that he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965 I was rarely convinced about anything. His talent was beyond question and he claimed to have all the contacts. I was soon back in his drawing room.
The idea was the life of Dr Thomas Barnardo, the nineteenth century philanthropist who founded the orphanages that bear his name. His story was a worthy one indeed, but not one that truly fired my imagination. The hero was too squeaky-clean, at least in Andrew's version of his life, and the enterprise was unoriginal in both conception and execution, owing far too much to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver.
On the other hand, Andrew's conviction of his score's precocious brilliance was infectious and not totally unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, later to be my agent for over a quarter of a century, memorably (and repeatedly) said, if there's a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint.
I set to work with enormous enthusiasm, in particular for those songs that were intended to be funny. Andrew outlined the plot, played me the tunes and in many instances gave me the title as well, most of which had presumably been thought up by his ex-wordsmith school pal who had already had a go. I skipped a day at the solicitors office, faking illness, to write my first batch of theatrical lyrics.

23,31,"Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake within a year of his and Lois's moving in. A possession which can only be afforded by the exercise of stringent and calculated economy is best not afforded at all. But at the time it had seemed a sensible, as well as a desirable, move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand. It was Lois who had argued the more strongly for a move, but he had put up little resistance to arguments which at the time had seemed compelling: the flat wasn't really suitable for a family, they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these, of course, could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. Mornington Mansions had never been an acceptable address for an up-and-coming young barrister and a successful businesswoman. She never said it without a sense that even speaking the words subtly diminished her standing, socially and economically.
Lois had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey, stayed in a mood of envious resentment, had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He would recall his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner from the kitchen, his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner, tired from his exhausting day in court, should be given peace, a little gentle cosseting, and relief from every petty domestic anxiety. She had been a 'lawyer's wife', indefatigable in legal good causes, elegantly present at all lawyers' functions, apparently content with the sphere of life which she had made her own. Well, that world had passed for ever. Lois had made it plain before their marriage that her career was as important as his. It hardly needed saying, this was, after all, a modern marriage. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.
Venetia must have come straight from the court to their offices and she had been in a dangerous mood. Something or someone had upset her. But the word 'upset' was too weak, too bland for the intensity of furious disgust with which she had confronted him. Someone had driven her to the limit of her endurance. He cursed himself. If he hadn't been in his room, if he'd only left a minute earlier, the encounter wouldn't have taken place, she would have had the night to think it over, to consider what, if anything, she ought to do. Probably nothing. The morning might have brought sense. He remembered every word of her angry accusations.
'I defended Brian Cartwright today. Successfully. He told me that when you were his counsel four years ago you knew before trial that he had bribed three of the jury. You did nothing. You went on with the case. Is that true?'
'He's lying. It isn't true.'
'He also said that he passed over some shares in his company to your fiancee. Also before trial. Is that true?'
'I tell you, he's lying. None of its true.'
The denial had been as instinctive as an arm raised to ward off a blow and had sounded unconvincing even to his own ears. His whole action had been one of guilt. The first cold horror draining his face was succeeded by a hot flush, bringing back shameful memories of his headmaster's study, of the terror of the inevitable punishment. He had made himself look into her eyes and had seen the look of contemptuous disbelief. If only he'd had some warning. He knew now what he should have said: 'Cartwright told me after the trial but I didn't believe him. I don't believe him now. That man will say anything to make himself important.'
But he had told a more direct, more dangerous lie, and she had known that it was a lie. Even so, why the anger, why the disgust? What was that old misdemeanour to do with her? Who had sent Venetia Aldridge to be guardian of the conscience of their legal practice? Or of his, come to that? Was her own conscience so clear, her behaviour in court always immaculate? Was she justified in destroying his career? And it would be destruction.

24,51,"Citizen Kane

When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor's fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst, its alleged subject, might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. It is perhaps the one film, above all others, that has inspired people to become film-makers. This is all the more astonishing since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles always maintained that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or wasn't allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it. But he had an extraordinary team at his disposal, cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the special-effects wizard Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz hit on the idea of portraying a newspaper magnate who both was and wasn't Hearst, Welles realised that he had found a perfect vehicle for himself both as director and actor, and seized his chance with the energy of a whirlwind.

Dermot and Carmel

Dermot thought that Carmel was rather odd that morning. Twice he had said that he might be late and not to worry if he dropped into the golf club on the way home. He had to have a natter with someone and that was the best place to have it. Twice she had nodded her head amiably and distantly as if she hadn't really heard or understood. 
'Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?' he had asked.
She had smiled. 'Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I hadn't anything to do all day so I was going to stroll down town and look at the shops. I was thinking that it was almost a sinful thing, just idling away the day.'
Dermot had smiled back. 'You're entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I""m late I won't want anything to eat. So don't go to any trouble.'
'No, that's fine.' she said.

Title Race 

Tea boy? Do you mind, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator
Human nature provides the most divine of comedies. Witness a recent study which has informed the nation that job titles are a prime cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a leading firm of recruitment consultants found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues.
Most shockingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to forgo a pay rise in favour of a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity is reaching such proportions that even basic greed is being overwhelmed, we are indeed in dire straits.
The truth is that in these brave new days of the early twenty-first century, nobody is content to be labelled subordinate.

25,68,"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly, by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production, if the conditions are right, of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction. The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.
Since television as a technology is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments. Two little-known, distinct alternatives deserve mentioning since they highlight what television might have been - in a different social context.
Experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone were followed up, so to speak, by radio amateurs in Britain in the early 1930s. Various popular science journals, such as Radio News, had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers and, throughout the 1930s, experimenting amateurs were active in many parts of the country. But Big Business, represented by the British Radio Manufacturers Association, in 1938 agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out. And so there passed, at least in Britain, the historical 'moment' for a counter-cultural development of television as a widely diffused, grass-roots, egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting in some form was, however, tied not only to strong economic interests, but also to the deep structures of modern societies. In spite of the activities of TV amateurs, television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s, and as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA. For example, in Britain, public viewing of television was the way in which most early audiences actually experienced the medium and this was even more the case in Germany. While the vision of grass-roots or amateur, two-way television was quite obviously doomed to a very marginal position at the very best, television systems largely based on collective public reception were in fact operating in several countries in the 1930s and may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as having presented more of a threat to the domestication of the medium. But it was a threat that was not to materialise.
Manufacturers saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division and relation between the public and private domains fundamental to modernity, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states. And all of this is now also happening on a global scale.
There is a clear relationship between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernisation meant increasing centralisation and concentration of capital and political power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were, both literally and metaphorically, 'on the move' in ways that left them relatively isolated compared to people in much more stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need felt by central government to reach all citizens with important information efficiently, and a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community' of the nation-state.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the World Wars, the interest in broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources necessary for conscious, informed and autonomous participation in political, social and cultural life played a very important role in many countries. Of course television is changing, and there is the risk that the very term broadcasting becomes outmoded or at least inadequate.

26,34,"Ralph unlocked the door to his let and as he entered the dark, motionless hall experienced that momentary qualm of ownership which even after three years still lightly besieged him sometimes when he returned alone at the end of the day. When he had first bought the flat, he used to come home in an eager, questioning mood - often as early as he could -- wondering what it had been doing during the hours he had been away. It had represented a form of welcome to him, a region in which his focus was undisputed and reliable. He supposed that he should have worried about intruders or burst drains in that moment of reunion, but his flat had always been sitting waiting for him with an expression of independence or of neglect, depending on whether he'd left it tidy or not. In the end he had begun to regard it merely as another cloistered annexe of himself, a space into which the stuffy chambers of his heart and head had gradually overspilled their contents.
He had grown impatient with its inability to be transformed. There was, of course, the small, angular puddle of letters which sometimes gathered by the door and the red eye of the answering machine which could occasionally be found resuscitated and blinking with life when he returned. And he was grateful that the glassy eyes of his windows hadn't been smashed nor the contents ravished with violence, mind you, he wondered what the flat would look like afterwards.
From the dreary distance of his shabby third-floor office on the Holloway Road, Ralph often looked forward to his three or four solitary evenings at home each week. Once he had fled the fabricated world of the office and felt the memory of himself begin patchily to return on his bus journey home, he no longer needed to be on his own, a fact which seemed continually to elude him in his social calculations. Sitting exposed at his desk he would crave isolation, unlimited time alone amongst his possessions, but the relief of escape drained him and he would vainly wait for some sense of selfhood to return. Instead, there was merely a resounding emptiness, which made him suspect during his long hours of loneliness that the alien exercise of doing work which did not suit him had forced him to change, moving him further and further from what he liked to think of as himself. He would often read or listen to music as the night deepened outside, familiar habits which now, however, he would find himself asking for whom or what he did them. His points of reference had grown dim, his signposts muddied: sensations and ideas would arrive and then get lost, circulating around the junctions of his mind, unable to find a connection.
There had been a time, he supposed, when he had not felt this powerless, when, had he but perceived his own worth, he might have escaped; but he had been so eager to fix himself up with something that he had been swept along by this great desire for something, and he had followed the first course which presented itself as if it had been ordained that he should do so.
He had tried, of course, after he left university, to formulate some plan for his own betterment, but it hadn't really surprised him to find, when he searched himself for ambition, merely the desire unobtrusively to survive. He had applied for the types of jobs which had become familiar to him though the talk of his peers, had latched himself wearily on to their futures and jogged behind as they rushed towards them, unable to imagine that he might be put to some use which would manufacture as its by-product his own happiness.
He had attended his only interview gratefully, and in the fever of examination did not think to test the position - an inexplicit editorial role on a free local newspaper for its own merits. Relieved at having pulled off twenty minutes of pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he had not considered the future of lengthy encounters by which he was now daily assaulted.

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and apart from a mechanic deep in the bowels of a truck, the only sign of life among the small factories on a backstreet is a whine of machinery from an upper window - work has begun at Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only bamboo bike-building course. I've gone along to watch the action. 
There's a sense of energy and industry. And of fun. Woodwork class was never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting trends to emerge in bike construction. Names like Californian manufacturer Calfee Design or Yorkshire's Bamboo Bikes have revived a construction method pioneered as early as 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the price. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies retails for $2,995, or PS1,868. 
It was this, plus the design challenge, that led James and Ian to spend years cooped up in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their idea was to establish a boutique bamboo bike business with products within reach of the average cyclist. 
Only after they had refined their research into a marketable product - James now tosses out phrases like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' while talking about bamboo - did they realise they were on the wrong track. 'We realised we didn't want just to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something; the craft of creating something unique and sustainable,' James explains. 
The outcome was something more community than company, and as such, the Bamboo Bike Club is still an occupation sandwiched between full-time jobs - James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be on the right track, with monthly courses whose competitive price buys you a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 
The question for me, a king of the botch job - my terrible handiwork failures litter my house - was about quality. On day one, the boys explain how to select bamboo for strength and how to form strong joints before tubes are glued lightly in place in the workshop: first the front triangle composed of 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more fiddly seat and the chain assembly. Alloy tubes are inserted for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts which require the strength and precise engineering impossible in bamboo. 
All this, together with the technical skill involved in using jigs, power tools and design blueprints, is a leap of faith for someone whose idea of DIY is flatpack furniture assembly. Accurate cutting for a clean joint can be tricky, for example. 
James and Ian buzz cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, triple-checking every joint, and will take over if a task seems insurmountable. The self-build is half the attraction for most participants; it may be no coincidence that all those on this course were engineers. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone messes up once or twice. 
No problem - just get another piece and have another go. Such is the benefit of bamboo. Each length has been pre-checked for quality, so you get to indulge in frame aesthetics: plain bamboo, black or mottled. 
Sunday is a more relaxed day, mainly spent building the lugs. Or rather, wraps: hemp bindings wrapped around the joints and dropouts then glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond that disperses loads evenly throughout the frame. With a final polymer coating for waterproofing, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other individual touches. And it is a bike built for the long haul, just as strong, the pair claim, as its metal equivalents. 
Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has failed to destroy one bike off-road over three months of testing. 'To be honest, our bikes are over-engineered - we use larger diameter tubes and over-thick bindings - but I prefer it like that,' James says. 
Technical issues aside, how good does a bamboo bike look? Somewhat scruffy alongside professional frames, it turns out - the hemp weave can look a bit like parcel tape, for example. But there's no denying their individuality and that, say James and Ian, is the point. 
Personally though, I believe that any bicycle made from this kind of material should be a relaxed affair, something for cruising sedately around on rather than racing. I therefore plump for a frame that avoids the stiff angularity of my existing metal machine: a 'Classic English' giving a gentle, easy-going ride. 
They also cycle well. I take James's bike for a spin and the ride is light, stiff and smooth thanks to bamboo's ability to dampen vibration. Impressive, considering I target every pothole. 'Some people love the build, but for me these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,' James says. 'They're so light, so effortless to ride.

28,60,"How to Write Poetry

Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day, but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. Setting oneself up as a know-all is dangerous, so I have decided to side-step the whole issue by saying that, for someone just beginning to write, no advice can be a substitute for abundant reading, extensive writing, and the freeing of the imagination and spirit in whatever way seems fruitful, barring total anarchy. Some people need their life to be reasonably secure before a poem will come; others can write their way out of misery. Some write to a timetable: others wait for some moment of crystallisation, a brainwave or slow dawning. All are right, providing they are not echoing some prescriptive score. And it's this finding of a tune which is important, hearing the still small voice inside yourself and feeding it, and watering it, and letting it out for air from time to time; one day it'll be old enough to take care of itself.

The Short Story

In the short story there is no room for overcrowding with too many characters, slabs of lengthy narrative, prolonged reminiscence or retrospection. Flashbacks must be fleeting, and only used if there is no other way to throw light on an issue. One effective way to do this is through a flash of memory in the leading character's mind; the recollection or reminder of an incident or scene, which stirred the current conflict. Such a recollection can get the story on its way or take it a big step forward at a crucial moment, but never at any time must it be allowed to put a brake on the action. In this respect, dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. Two voices in discussion can reveal two sides of a question in far less time than it takes to explain it from only one person's viewpoint. It also avoids unnecessary wordage and holds or increases a reader's interest. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start, but this doesn't mean that brevity must reduce it to the level of a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as well sustained in a short story as in a novel, but in the short story the art lies in making every word count in a compact space.

Screenplays

Anyone who knows how to play chess will understand how to write a screenplay for a film. Most chess players stumble from beginning to end. We don't know much, but we know enough to play. We move without really knowing what's going to happen further on in the game. Maybe we can see one or two moves ahead, and, if we can, were pleased by our uncanny ability to see even that far ahead. Better than the days when we couldst see ahead at all - when we were playing blindly.
Over time, as we learned more about playing chess, we made a startling revelation: chess depends more upon long-term strategy than upon short-term tactics. Up till then, we'd been happy with a rather short-sighted approach. Suddenly, we became aware of 'the big picture'. We began to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. And once we saw the game as a whole, we began to see patterns emerge in the play. Gambits, they call them. And the patterns have names, such as openings, middle games and end games. In chess, as in screenplay writing, the more often you play, the more aware you become of its complexities.

Looking at Writing

'Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write'. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin got it right: language is a human instinct, but written language is not. Language is found in all societies, present and past. Although languages change, they do not improve: English is no more complex than the languages of Stone Age tribes; modern English is not an advance of Old English. All healthy children master their language without lessons or corrections. When children are thrown together without a usable language, they invent one of their own. Compare all this with writing.
Writing systems have been invented only infrequently in history. They originated only in a few complex civilisations and they started off code and slowly improved over the millennia. Until recently, most children never learned to read or write; even with today's universal education, many children struggle and fail. A group of children is no more likely to invent an alphabet than it is to invent the internal combustion engine. Children are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on.

29,46,"AESTHETICS

By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. In common conception, the work of art is often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. Since the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience, the result is not favourable to understanding. In addition, the very perfection of some of these products, the prestige they possess because of a long history of unquestioned admiration, creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When an art product once attains classic status, it somehow becomes isolated from the human conditions under which it was brought into being and from the human consequences it engenders in actual life experience.
When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance, with which aesthetic theory deals. Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort and achievement. A primary task is thus imposed upon one who undertakes to write upon the philosophy of the fine arts. This task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognised to constitute experience. Mountain peaks do not float unsupported, they do not even just rest upon the earth. They are the earth in one of its manifest operations. It is the business of those who are concerned with the theory of the earth, geographers and geologists, to make this fact evident in its various implications. The theorist who would deal philosophically with fine art has a like task to accomplish.
If one is willing to grant this position, even if only by way of temporary experiment, one will see that there follows a conclusion which is at first sight surprising. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding and insight. It is, of course, quite possible to enjoy flowers in their coloured form and delicate fragrance without knowing anything about plants theoretically. But if one sets out to understand the flowering of plants, one is committed to finding out something about the interactions of soil, air, water and sunlight that condition the growth of plants. 
In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens. Yet so extensive and subtly pervasive are the ideas that set art itself upon a remote pedestal that many people would be repelled rather than pleased if told that they enjoyed their casual recreations, in part at least, because of their aesthetic quality.The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts: for instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. For, when what they know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides. Many people who protest against the museum conception of art still share the fallacy from which that conception springs. For the popular notion comes from a separation of art from the objects and scenes of ordinary experience that many theorists and critics pride themselves upon holding and even elaborating.

30,69,"0ral History

The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach, although they are often interested in the mechanisms of 'behaviour', study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Within the 'whole animal' approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals, often in their wild habitats. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, there is now a fruitful coming together of the two.
Among these types, it is the physiologists who like to emphasise that their methods are the more fundamental. However, even if we knew how every nerve cell operated in the performance of some pattern of behaviour, this would not remove the need for us to study it at a behavioural level also. Behaviour has its own organisation and its own units mat we must use for its study. Trying to describe the nest-building behaviour of a bird in terms of the actions of individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a page of a book with a high-powered microscope.

The Social Sciences

A problem facing all students who come to study a social science for the first time is that they must do two things simultaneously. They must familiarise themselves with the substance or content of their new subject and, at the same time, they must learn the methodology of the subject. That is, they must become familiar not only with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised, that is with the logical basis of the subject itself. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related. Because we are all familiar with social life through our everyday experiences we may feel that the social sciences are very largely a matter of common-sense. But, as a look at any textbook will quickly indicate, though each of the social sciences is concerned with people in society, each discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, each uses particular methods of study and each employs its own set of concepts. It is this set of concepts, the most basic ideas in a subject, which constitutes the 'logical basis of the subject', which enables the social scientist to go beyond everyday common-sense and which distinguishes one discipline from another.

Classical Architecture

To the classical world, that of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings. 'Architecture', says the Roman architect Vitruvius, 'consists of Order, and of Arrangement, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Propriety and Distribution.' For several of these terms he gives a Greek equivalent: his definitions probably derived from an earlier Greek authority whose writings are lost to us. Utility and Function are not part of this definition, though in his book Vitruvius does go on to describe the best form and arrangements for different purposes of structure; but here, at the beginning, the aesthetic emphasis, architecture as an art, has priority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was obviously a long prehistory of basic construction, of hut habitations simple in form and material, both in Greece and Italy, which did not match up to Vitruvius' artistic requirements. Though these were, by definition, inartistic they nevertheless contributed an essential element of form, which persisted into the later sophisticated architectural concepts.

Dione Reverend was a mere editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr John Gray. 'I took one look at the title and knew it would be a number one bestseller,' she says, chuckling, and she was right. The desperately understanding Dr Gray is now a multimillionaire and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr Gray's slim volume on how to bridge communication gaps between the sexes is the unofficial mascot of a huge and expanding self-help industry that may, as its insiders claim, answer some of American's myriad yearnings for betterment. It also feeds off those yearnings, creates hundreds more and - not incidentally - props up the entire world of New York publishing.
As Britain is learning, the genre can fill entire polls with tomes os quackish and histrionic as their covers - but there are worse. For every self-help title published, thousands are rejected as too derivative or specialised. This is no small mercy. As a new breed of heavyweight editor-cum-ogent goes looking for the next lightweight blockbuster, prose style is the lost thing on anybody's mind. Marketability is everything. 'How promotable is the author? What's the ""hook'? Is it universal enough?' Ms Reverend rattles off the key questions, then admits: 'If someone comes to me with a really catchy title, that's two thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.'

Autobiographies

There has to be a tacit understanding, a pact, between an autobiographer and reader that the truth is being told. Such at pact is, I would guess, rarely observed to the full. There are many reasons why the writer should lapse. There may be actions or thoughts which he feels it is simply too shameful to make public. There may be things he decides against putting down on paper because (as he rationalises) they are not important enough. There are also more complex and interesting reasons for surreptitiously breaking the pact. The autobiographer may decide that the ultimate goal of the work, the truth about himself, can be served by inventing stories that encapsulate the truth more neatly, more pointedly than strict adherence to the facts ever could. Or he may break the pact by deciding, from the beginning, never to adhere to it. He may call his book an autobiography simply in order to create a positive balance of credulity in the reader's mind that will be extremely convenient for him in his storytelling, and which, in the case of his more naive readers, may not be exhausted even by the time the story ends, so that these readers will go away thinking they have read a true history, when they have read nothing but a fiction. All of which can be done in no particular spirit of cynicism.

Dashiell Hammett's detective stories

Students of the detective story have explained the flourishing of this genre as an expression of the conflicts of late nineteenth and early twentieth century society. The detective story is essentially an allegory. The crime is a symbolic enactment of some innate human impulse of lust or greed, and its solution, at least in the traditional story, represents the reintegration of the personality with society, its lawless impulses quelled so that society can again function smoothly. In Hammett's peculiar version, society is returned to its former state, but that itself is shown to be corrupt and false.
The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's tales are two aspects of the same personality. The private eye and his prey understand each other and are, in a strange way, comfortable with each other. The private eye has a foot in each camp. From the point of view of the criminal he is a bit too straight, and from that of the law a bit too seedy. He is at once a crook and a competitor. The mission of the private eye is sometimes tempered by his sense of complicity, and sometimes his punitive zeal is intensified by his anxiety about this ambiguity.

SCIENCE WRITING

Today's greatest scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss that art and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar milieu: at the Grand Hotel (where he was staying while promoting his new book). Neither of us, it has to be said, felt much at home. As for writing a piece set in surroundings of such lifeless self-aggrandisement, Gould said: 'I couldn't do it: Trollope might but he knew the culture. And knowing the culture is central to being a successful writer. Science, for example, is a civilisation of its own. As a result, only scientists can make a good job of presenting it. If you don't live in the community and don't understand its rules, you are crippled from the start.'
One of Gould's axioms is: never write down to the reader. 'Make no concessions,' he says. 'You can simplify the language but must never adulterate it. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers notice that they are being patronised, your piece is

American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America, however, has only just discovered him - although the Wall Street Journal's description of Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose beats went all but unnoticed for most of the 20th century' is taking things too far. But now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked; the American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as icon and exemplar. His sell-appointed apostles recount the details of his deeds with awe; they extract lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors, and insiders refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined, resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, took Shackleton for a role model years ago. His firm specialises in 'communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises'. Such as? Such as 'this firm's plant blew up' or 'half the workforce has to go'. While not forgetting that Shackleton served time in public relations for a Glasgow steel works, it may be a trifle difficult to spot instantly the relevance of eking out the last bit of albatross in sub-zero temperatures to putting a spin on a derivatives trading disaster for the Internet.
'Even if a company manages its crises beautifully, it can still do a lot of harm by communicating sadly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. he was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose -- such as their lives. In some ways the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their objective, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn hack.
In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to duck and squirm, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept responsibility. His 1914 expedition was the one that became the stuff of legend. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally went down, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries the then kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men continually informed and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. 'He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling thry're being criticised.'
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. 'One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating, especially in America, a culture that is fanatically opposed to letting time sort things out,' says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you'll get your money back. To ""fix it"" and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a stinker, don't keep selling it.'
Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expeditions: 'He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavour is increasing.

The purpose of a map is to express graphically the relations of points and features on the earth's surface to each other. These are determined by distance and direction. In early times distance wha often expressed in units of time, for example 'so many hours' march' or 'a day's journey by river', but such measurements gave more information about the relative ease of crossing the local terrains than they did about actual distance. The other element is direction, but for the ordinary traveller, whose main concern was 'Where do I go from here?' and 'How far away is it?', the accurate representation of direction was not of primary importance. Partly for this reason, written itineraries for a long time rivalled maps. Even today, certain types of maps, for example those showing railway systems, may make little attempt to show true directions. Similarly, conspicuous landmarks along a route were at first indicated by signs, realistic or conventional, and varied in size to indicate their importance. Clearly the conventions employed varied with the purpose of the map, and also from place to place, so that in studying early maps the first essential is to understand the particular convention employed.
The history of cartography is largely that of the increase in the accuracy with which these elements of distance and direction are determined and in the comprehensiveness of the map content. In this development, cartography has called in other sciences to its aid. For example, instead of determining direction by observing the position of a shadow at midday, or of a constellation in the night sky, or even of a steady wind, use was made of terrestrial magnetism through the magnetic compass, and instruments were evolved which enabled horizontal angles to be calculated with great accuracy. 
The application of astronomical concepts, and the extension of the knowledge of the world through 
exploration, encouraged attempts to map the known world. Then astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but is flattened slightly at the poles, which introduced further refinements into the mapping of large areas. Meanwhile, the demands being made of the map maker were shifting significantly. The traveller or the merchant ceased to be the sole user of maps. The soldier, especially after the introduction of artillery, and the problems of range, field of fire, and dead ground which it raised, demanded an accurate representation of the surface features, in place of the earlier conventional or pictorial delineation, and a solution in any degree satisfactory was not reached until the contour was invented.
Then there was the archaeologist, the historian and, much later, the modern geographer, each with their own special requirements. In order to address these, the present-day cartographer has had to evolve methods of mapping all kinds of 'distributions', from geological strata and climatic regimes to land use. It is the present widespread recognition of the value of the map in the co-ordination and interpretation of phenomena in many sciences that has led to what may truly be called a modern renaissance o cartography.
It would be misleading of me to represent the stages summarily sketched above as being either continuous or consecutive. There have been periods of retrogression or stagnation, broken by others of rapid development, during which outmoded ideas have held their place beside the new. Again, cartographers have constantly realised the theoretical basis for progress, but have had to wait for technical improvement in their instruments before they could apply their new ideas. Since the easiest way to make a map is to copy an old one, and considerable capital has often been locked up in printing places or stock map publishers have often been resistant to new ideas. Consequently, maps must never be accepted uncritically as evidence of contemporary knowledge and technique. 
Clearly, the maps, many thousands in number, which have come down to us today, are the results of much human work and thought. They constitute therefore an invaluable record for the students of man's past.

34,24,"Othello

The transfer to London from Stratford of an exceptional production of Shakespeare's play Othello allows me to make amends for an unfair review that I wrote when the show opened last spring. Back then I complained that Ray Fearon was too young to play the title role and I was guilty of running down his acting. I still think its a distortion of the tragedy to remove the age difference between Othello and Desdemona but I eat my words about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance. Indeed the whole cast is magnificent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with the other young officers get dangerously out of hand, and the moment when Iago begins to lose control and has to struggle to get a grip on himself. And I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia prepares Desdemona for bed. The pace and tension throughout are terrific. Do not miss this production.

Lake Vostok

In the heart of Antarctica, nothing stirs. On the fringes of the continent there are penguins, seals and birds aplenty. But up on the great white plateau in the interior, life has no foothold. Except, that is, in a vast hidden expanse of freshwater named Lake Vostok which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometres of ice, directly below the coldest spot on earth. The water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists can hardly wait to probe its mysterious depths and discover what strange organisms lurk within. Geologists and glaciologists are hot on their heels. For two years now, researchers round the world have been plotting ways to uncover the lakes secrets, and, if they get their wish, in the next few years we will witness the decade of Lake Vostok.

Scientists

There was an interesting thing on the radio last week. It seems that a bunch of scientists are getting themselves hot under the collar over what drives them to be scientists; the expression 'because it's there' springs to mind. Sure we all know its the age-old quest for knowledge, the desire to understand everything from the atom to the black hole. But what these guys want to know is why we want to know all of this in the first place and why can't science explain why we want to know?
Surely, it's more important to know whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than get bogged down in debates over the point of it all.

35,56,"Enough Sleep?

Tiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition. As the richer, busier countries have grown, so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected, and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists, or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.
Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms, its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. 'People need more sleep,' says one leading sleep researcher. 'People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.'
Recently, a sleep researcher tried an experiment. He offered his subjects the opposite of the modern routine. 'I allowed them to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to reach an equilibrium of eight-and-a-quarter hours. That indicates a great rebound of sleep - sleep that they hadn't been getting!'
In Europe, such propositions are perhaps most thoroughly tested in a small unassuming building on a university campus in the English Midlands. The university sleep research laboratory has investigated, among many subjects, the effects of fatigue on sailors, the effects of airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.
For guinea pigs, they advertise in the student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid PS5 an hour, and asked to adjust their sleeping patterns according to instructions. Dr Louise Reyner provides reassurance: 'Some people are quite worried, because you're putting electrodes on their heads, and they think you can see what they're dreaming or thinking.'
In fact, the laboratory's interest is more physical. In a darkened room stands a motorway simulator, the front section of car facing a wide projection screen. The subjects are always told to arrive at 2pm, in the body's natural mid-afternoon lull, after a short night's sleep or no sleep at all. The projector is switched on and they are asked to drive, while answering questions. An endless road rolls ahead, sunlight glares; and the air is warm.
The young men all deny they are going to fall asleep. Dr Reyner has a video recording of one trying not to. At first the person at the wheel is very upright, wet and bleary eyes determinedly fixed on the windscreen. Then he begins to blink briefly, every now and again; then for longer, and more often, with a slight drop of the head. Each nod grows heavier than the last. The blinks become a 10-second blackout. Every time, he jerks awake as if nothing has happened. But the car, by the second or third occasion, has shot off the carriageway.
A coffee might have helped. Two cups, Dr Reyner says, even after no sleep at all, can make you a safe driver for half an hour or more. She recommends a whole basket of alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated chewing gum. Shift workers, she is quite sure, could probably use them.
But apart from these findings, what else do know about human sleep with any kind of certainty? It is known that humans sleep, like other mammals, according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness, from stage one sleep, the shallowest, to stage four, the deepest. When dreams occur, which is usually during the lightest sleep, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids, thus preventing injuries.
Beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested, for example, that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.
However, there is a strong degree of certainty among scientists that women seep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though they don't know why. When asked what sleep is for, some sleep researchers reply in cosmic terms: 'Sleep is a tactic to travel through time without injury.'
Moreover, people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor has investigated nocturnal British life between 1500 and 1850 and discovered that sleeping routines were very different. People went to bed at nine or ten, then woke up after midnight, after what they called their 'first sleep', stayed awake for an hour, and then had their 'morning sleep'.
The interlude was a haven for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time thieving. The poorest were the greatest beneficiaries of this quiet time, fleetingly freed from the constraints and labours that ruled their day-time existence.
By the 17th century, however, as artificial light became more common, the rich began to switch to the more concentrated, and economically more efficient, mode of recuperation that we follow today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution pushed back the dusk for everyone except some country-dwellers, by making most people work longer hours in lighted buildings.
Yet beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was widespread until quite recently, and according to a leading anthropologist, in some non-western settings there are still no rigid bedtimes. People go to bed for a few hours, and then get up again. The idea of a night's solid sleep does not apply. For certain tribal societies, human and animal noises and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators combine to make continuous sleep impossible.

36,39,"Art on TV

Why is it that television so consistently fails when it comes to programmes about the visual arts? Painting and sculpture should be natural subjects for the camera, which has the ability to show a whole work of art, then move in close to examine the details. Yet I can think of few series on television that have managed to convey both the pleasure and complexity of looking at them.
A good example of what goes wrong can be seen in Robert Hughes's eight part survey of American art, American Visions. Hughes is a critic you can trust, he has a personality that commands attention and he has been given nearly eight hours in which to introduce British audiences to a school of art that British galleries have totally ignored. I had expected the series to focus on great works of art. What I got instead was one about the way American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

Dealing in Metals

For 20 years I worked as an international metals dealer and gained something of a reputation as a speculator. Metals are regulated far less than other markets. With a bit of luck, a willingness to take a risk and a good understanding of how the market works, it's possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is part and parcel of the industry. The buccaneering culture fits nicely with a free-market global economy. But now the free-trade economists who claimed the market itself would maintain the price of scarce metals have found the opposite is happening. More minerals are being extracted and the cost of raw materials is decreasing. Taking inflation into account, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into allegations made against one of the multinational conglomerates that benefit from these cheap raw materials.

Extract from a Holiday Brochure

Abaco and its off-shore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas that stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer, to Cuba. Each one has its own personality, each one has something to offer.
The key to getting anywhere in the islands and cays of Abaco is a boat. If you don't get one thrown in with the room don't worry. Be happy. There are ferries galore. And water-taxis. Or, there are plenty of boats to rent if you prefer to go under your own steam.
But sailing is the most popular mode of transport here. Abaco is nicknamed 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason.
Those calm, naturally protected waters are also a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. It's not only at sea that gems can be found.

Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner's point of view.

Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. There are deadlines, there are restrictions, normally quite severe, on their length; and when published they claim houseroom only for as long as the newspaper they are printed in - a day or a week, at most a month. Moreover, the literary status of reviews tends to be settled by their ephemerality. It is usually supposed, not only by the public but, quite often, by the writers themselves, that reviewing is work that nobody would do if there weren't some reason -- shortage of cash would he cited most often, though another good reason is that you can't work all day on a novel or a 'serious'
book of any sort - which prevents them from occupying their time with something more valuable.
Yet reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to be bright, brisk and summarily fair in the six or eight hundred words of an ordinary newspaper review, quite another to control, without looseness of argument, the six or eight thousand words sometimes allowed by international journals. And the fifteen hundred words of a leading piece in the weekly magazines present some of the problems of both short and long. Not that length is the only consideration. For one thing, the reviewer obviously needs to think about the probable audience, the weekend skimmer at one end of the scale, the person already interested enough in the subject to tackle a serious review-article at the other. Finally, a reviewer needs to know quite a bit about quite a number of things; and must be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. It follows almost infallibly that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.
The American novelist Johh Updike, who rather looks down on criticism -- 'hugging the shore' he calls it - nevertheless enjoys some coastal reviewing in the intervals between his transoceanic novel-writing. Understandably reluctant to allow even his less ambitious voyages to go without any permanent record, he gathers together his every review, however short, into volumes with mildly self-deprecating titles. It might be thought that lesser persons should accept ephemerality as the penalty appropriate to their coastal caution, but it is hand to see why, if they can get away with it, they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the measure of permanence, and the measure of vanity, proper to their station, especially if they believe that some of their best writing has been 'buried' in reviews. I admit to feeling this about my own work.
My own principal occupation has been academic, and most of my 'serious' books are recognisably academic products, the sort of thing professors like, and are expected to do as part of their jobs. However, the English-speaking world (I think fortunately) acknowledges nothing comparable to the sharp distinction people from other cultures make between reviewing and literary study -- and so with us it is quite usual for the same people to do both. The days are gone when other academics reviled reviewer-professors for unseemly self-display, or waste of academic time, or betrayal of the dignity of their institutions. And complaints from non-professors, to the effect that the professors are taking the bread out of their mouths, are also less common than they were, partly because there is so much more reviewing nowadays that practically everyone can have some, partly, no doubt, because the bread is often such a meagre ration.
My own view is that these arrangements are good for both readers -- since they can be fairly certain the reviewer has at least some idea what he is talking about -- and professors, if only because the work helps to keep them sane. It also reminds them that they have a duty, easily neglected, to make themselves intelligible to non-professors. When talking among themselves they may feel some need to be impressively arcane, but when addressing intelligent non-professors they need to make sure they are communicating effectively.
Finally, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, and despite all that can be said to dignify it, reviewing must be a secondary occupation.

38,27,"Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results.
All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice

Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

McAndrews Hotel

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition, instigated by my grandmother, and by now it has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

39,42,"REMOVAL DAY

With her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.

The van said, Susan noticed, 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man, his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables, and his team of helpers, not so gentle.
It was a lovely house that she was leaving, an elegant four-storeyed building overlooking a tiny harbour. The years she had spent there, the years of the children growing up and leaving, hung around in the air, faintly present like agitated dust. 
When told that they had bought this house, Robert, then five, had asked thoughtfully, 'Mum, when you buy a house, how d'you get it home?' You could miss a little boy in the physical presence of the adult he had become; Robert was here, helping, and in particular making sure she didn't let on about the piano. Francesca was here too, also helping, in her bossy way, stubbornly certain that nobody but she, the family daughter, would be careful enough over a fine instrument like a Steinway piano.
'She doesn't look like she's going to cry on us,' observed Fred. 'That's something.' 'Do people cry?' Susan asked, intrigued. 'You'd be surprised,' said Fred. 'They go around merry as magpies helping out till its all in the van, then you look round and there they are, crying in the middle of an empty room. They're fine when we get to the new place, mind. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.'
She could easily imagine.
Left to herself, Susan would have warned the removers about the piano before accepting the estimate. Robert had said sternly that it was their business to see the problem, and their bad luck if they didn't. The piano now stood in solitary glory in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would leave it till last, naturally. Sitting on the bottom stair, for all the chairs were gone now, she remembered the time they had arrived.
The day she was living through now was like that day filmed and run backwards - the piano had been carried in first. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours the team of removal men struggled manfully with it, until it seemed they would simply have to give up.
They brought it up to the turn of the stairs, and down again, and cut out banister rails, and got it jammed anyway, while little Robert looked on enthralled, and young Francesca wailed, 'We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!' And of course they couldn't, not with a musical daughter destined to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it in, and a way had been found.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to the crisis and had resolved it. The piano had been left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in - there was much less of it then, they had been relatively young and hard up. And next day, to everyone's surprise, a builder had been engaged to take out the first floor window.
Then, from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from the inshore boats, a little crane was borrowed, and dragged up the hill by means of the local farmer's tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, hooked to the crane and gently swung safely through the gaping window, while the entranced children danced with joy at the sight of it.
However, the whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. 'That's that,' Peter had said. 'That's there for ever.' But for ever is a long time.
The children were increasingly too busy to come home at weekends, and Susan was no longer so mobile in the house, and puffing as she climbed the stairs. The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.
'Are you all right, love?' Fred was saying. 'Mind yourself, it's just the piano to come now, and then we'll be on our way.' She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. 'No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.
Truth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment's thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.
Only just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. 'Easy does it!' cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.
It was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. 'What's the joke, then?' asked Fred, but he merely started them off again.

40,61,"'You don't take sugar, do you? shouted his secretary, not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might, because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn't normally supposed to be there. Actually nowadays he was usually there all the time, having discovered that to take up his proprietorial privilege of staying away was tantamount to opening the floodgates. Not for the first time he pondered the easy, imperceptibly divided stages by which he had progressed from valued counsellor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch at carefully planned planning meetings complete with agenda, to hapless dogsbody moving one step ahead of catastrophe, with nowhere to park when he arrived at work in the mornings.
'This came,' she yelled, vaguely waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. 'From that chap in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it.' A typed label said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just under that it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see that word 'synopsis'. At the very least he wanted to see a label saying 'A First Draft'. Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not really want to see another, however heavily revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given an advance of several thousands of pounds for this book during the initial flurry of activity when Lancelot had bought the firm. One of several old friends from whom Lancelot had made the capital error of commissioning books, Ian Cuthbert was a particularly flagrant proof that in such circumstances the possessor of a wayward temperament, far from nerving himself to behave more predictably for friendship's sake, will actually become less 'pindownable' than ever.
Lancelot skipped the blurb come preamble which he had read for what seemed like the hundredth time and sampled the synopsis proper. There was scarcely a phrase that he did not recognise at a glance. He closed the folder and shifted it to one side. Plainly at this rate Ian's manuscript would never be forthcoming. As well as almost wholly lacking the brilliance for which its author was supposed to be famous, the synopsis, under its doggedly frolicsome tone, had the unmistakable dead ring of a lost conviction. Lancelot remembered tales of a famous author-about-town whose last book, published incomplete after his death, had been coaxed from him chapter by chapter, one payment at a time. But in that case, the payments were fractions of a hypothetical advance which had never been given in the first place. Ian's advance had been enormous; a blatant reversal of the sound business principle by which authors must deliver a manuscript now in order to be paid with inflated currency later.
Lancelot, who had read modern languages at Oxford, could remember the day when Ian Cuthbert had been the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of promise that it had made everywhere else feel provincial. Ian's contemporaries had plotted to take over the British theatre and in a remarkably short time they had actually done so. But their mental energy had seemed like indolence when you looked at Ian. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what one very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to overhear it. Yet for some reason, the whole frostily coruscating galaxy of Ian's creative intellect had remained locked in its closet. While less gifted deviants came out and conquered, Ian went further in. At the height of his influence as a literary taste-maker he was already notoriously difficult to deal with. Officially appointed by the relevant public agency to edit a comprehensive magazine of the arts, he was like a general with a million tons of equipment pinned down on the beach by nothing except an excess of opportunity. The magazine used up the budget for a dozen issues without appearing once. Similarly, his thrice-renewed three-year contract with one of the fashion magazines engendered little except legends about the size of his emolument, which was increased from generosity to extravagance in an attempt to make him produce more, and then from extravagance to munificence in an attempt to make him produce anything. At the editorial working breakfasts - there were always at least two of the titled photographers present to capture the scene for posterity - Ian spat witty venom through clenched teeth, and poured nitric acid on other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could scarcely be depended upon to turn up for his own funeral.

'Look here, it's no good!' said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice in tow, had just collected me and my trunk from the posh girls' school I attended. He had also just sat through Parent's Day, in the course of which I was presented with the Latin prize and the prize for the girl who had done best in her end-of-school exams. He had had a long conversation with my headteacher, and now here we were bound for home and holidays.
'What isn't?' I said, though I had guessed the trend of his thoughts from my father's unusual silence. He was a talkative man as a rule. 'You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,' he said. 'What with all those certificates. I was told you will get a scholarship to Oxford.'
'So?' I said, brazening it out. 'Mightn't that be useful?'
'I am also given to understand,' he went on, and then I knew the confrontation was coming, 'that you have ambitions to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!' My father knew quite a lot about barristers and the law.
'I just said that,' I said. 'I couldn't think of anything else to say!'
'And apparently,' he went on, 'you have the right sort of personality - you can pick the bones out of a mass of material pretty quickly, you have the gift of the gab and you enjoy performing.'
'I don't know about that,' I said. 'All I know is what I see in television dramas.'
'Be that as it may,' he went on, pulling himself together, 'I feel your heart's never going to be in the business now. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that I can't see you fancying it.'
The trouble was that, like most children of hereditary trades, I did feel confined by the family expectations. I could see there were various professions open to me, and I wanted to explore the possibilities. At the same time, like a coward, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as frightened of him as Maurice was - I was the favourite - but I found him formidable.
'It's too soon to know,' I said feebly.
'I tell you you're not going to want to join us,' said my father, who had an annoying way of usually being right in such prophecies, 'and it's a pity because you've got the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.'
'There's still Maurice,' I said, sullen. My father snorted. We both knew Maurice hated the business. 'Anyway,' I went on, 'you could always use me as a sort of consultant.'
It was not as if my mother was around to lend a hand - she had died early in my childhood and my father had brought me and Maurice up. Maurice was two years younger than I was, and because he was motherless, early in our lives I got into the habit of taking care of him. It was not a hardship. I loved Maurice. Because the business was so successful we lived in a good deal of luxury - in a big house in London, posh schools for both of us, nice clothes, parties, theatres, operas. My father knew all kinds of people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house buzzed with good talk and interesting encounters.
'I tell you what,' my father continued our conversation. 'You can go on helping us out in holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us you can. It will give you a bit of pocket money, and be a real help to me.'
'OK,' I said, relieved to be spared immediate choices and decisions, and especially the bout of depression and sulks my father would sink into if I opposed him. This was the way he controlled us. So it happened. In my last term at school, and then on vacations from university, I lent a hand, never more than about twice a year, and always on the safer assignments. I became one of the smarter undergraduates, with a little house of my own, a small but powerful white car, designer clothes, and a black dress with a Paris label that I intended to wear when I took my final exams.
It was in my last term that my father came up to see me and drove me out to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks to go. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree (in Law), and I knew that if I kept my head and spent these last precious days carefully arranging information in my mind, he might well be right. I felt poised, confident, concentrated.
This was not to be. My father told me that, in about a week, he needed me to do one last assignment for him, that it was the most important piece of business the family firm had ever attempted, and that he would see that it was more than worth my while. 
'But Dad,' I protested, 'I've got my final exams coming up, and I just need to concentrate on that. It's really important that I do well and I don't want to have to think about anything else just now.'
I could tell that such pressures were simply beyond my father's imagination (or was it that he was somehow jealous of my life away from him?) and that he would interpret a refusal from me as a heartless betrayal in his hour of need.
That was not all. As he described the procedures I saw more clearly than ever before the single-mindedness of my father -- the clarity and resourcefulness with which he set about his life's work, the dynamic energy, the perfect self-control of the man. In his way he was a sort of genius, and I bowed to that in him. It made my own plans and hopes seem less important.

42,25,"I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I end neither with a death or a marriage. Instead I leave my reader in the air. This book consists of my recollections of a man with whom I was thrown into close contact only at long intervals, and I have little knowledge of what happened to him in between. I suppose that by the exercise of invention I could fill the gaps plausibly enough and so make my narrative more coherent; but I have no wish to do that. I only want to set down what I know.
To save embarrassment to people still living I have given to the persons who play a part in this story names of my own contriving, and I have in other ways taken pains to make sure that no one should recognise them. The man I am writing about is not famous. It may be that he never will be. It may be that when his life at last comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Then my book, if it is read at all, will be read only for what intrinsic interest it may possess. But it may be that the way of life that he has chosen for himself and the peculiar strength and sweetness of his character may have an ever-growing influence over his fellow men so that, long after his death perhaps, it may be realised that there lived in this age a very remarkable creature. Then it will be quite clear of whom I write in this book and those who want to know at least a little about his early life may find in it something to their purpose. I think my book, within its acknowledged limitations, will be a useful source of information to my friend's biographers.
I do not pretend that the conversations I have recorded can be regarded as verbatim reports. I never kept notes of what was said on this or the other occasions, but I have a good memory for what concerns me, and though I have put these conversations in my own words they faithfully represent, I believe, what was said. I remarked a little while back that I have invented nothing but I have taken the liberty that historians have taken to put into the mouths of the persons of my narrative speeches that I did not myself hear and could not possibly have heard. I have done this for the same reasons that the historians have, to give liveliness and verisimilitude to scenes that would have been ineffective if they had been merely recounted. I want to be read and I think I am justified in doing what I can to make my book readable. The intelligent reader will easily see for himself where I have used this artifice, and he is at perfect liberty to reject it.
Another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is that the persons I have chiefly to deal with are of another culture. It is very difficult to know people and I don't think one can ever really know any but one's own countrymen. For men and women are not only themselves; they are also the region in which they were born, the city apartment or the farm in which they learnt to walk, the games they played as children, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed and the poets they read. It is all these things that have made them what they are, and these are the things that you cant come to know by hearsay, you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. And because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except from observation, it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book. I have never attempted to deal with any but my own countrymen, and if I have ventured to do otherwise in short stories it is because in them you can treat your characters more summarily. You give the reader broad indications and leave him to fill in the details.

43,15,"Fashion

Fashion is often seen as a modern phenomenon, entirely dependent upon nineteenth- and twentieth-century capitalism for its development. Most historians of fashion are at pains to point out, though, that fashion, at least in the sense of style and design, has a very long history. They often take the rise of the market and mercantile trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as their starting point.
As societies have developed in complexity, populations have expanded, and multiple technologies for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance. Consequently, it is difficult to say with any degree of certainty today what any item of clothing or adornment actually means. For example, a man's suit, supposedly an indicator of the most extreme uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Writer

Newspaper reports of publishers in bidding wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed idea of what life is like for your average novelist. Down at my end of the business - i.e. not exactly topping the best-seller lists - there are two ways of making ends meet. The wisest among us write in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if the book doesn't immediately get snapped up and turned into a film. Those such as myself, however, are literary odd-jobbers, subsisting on a bit of teaching, the occasional workshop and articles like this. I have heard tell of an in-house writing opportunity offered by a chocolate factory, but I've never managed to get anything like that. Somehow, though, by dint of juggling part-time jobs and credit cards and also, more often than not, thanks to the generosity of those names you find in Acknowledgements, the novel gets written.

Sudden Fame

The small venues we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell out and extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working, we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring followers. In a matter of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored by our admirers and all of our needs catered for by our management and other interested parties. Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced by a strange naive over-confidence that only naturally shy people who have been thrust into similar situations can relate to.

44,64,"Music - The Challenge Ahead

Technological advances continue to transform our lives at work, at home and in our leisure activities. Susan Hallam discusses their impact on music in Britain.

In the latter part of the 20th century, we saw a rapid increase in the opportunities available for listening to music through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos and a rapidly developing range of multi-media techniques. Along with this, there has been a decline in the performance of live music and in the full-time employment opportunities for professional musicians.
There seems little doubt that the widening access to music is likely to continue, fulfilling as it does so many human needs. On a national level, no major state occasion is without music. For individuals, it provides opportunities for numerous activities, formal and informal.
Indeed, a society without music is surely unthinkable and it seems that the issue is not whether there will be music in the 21st century but what the nature of that music will be, and also whether there will be a continued perceived need for people to learn to play musical instruments.
I would respond to the latter question on a positive note. The music industry is one of the major generators of income in Britain and musical skill and talent will continue to be important in preparing individuals to work in a variety of professions, in particular those related to the media.
In addition to its vocational significance, there is a growing body of evidence that playing an instrument may be beneficial to the development of skills at an earlier stage. Research in the USA has suggested that listening to or actively making music has a direct positive effect on spatial reasoning, one aspect of the measurement of intelligence.
While these results are still to be successfully replicated, other data from Europe has indicated that an increase in group music lessons can have positive effects on social relationships in school and on concentration in young children and those with behavioural difficulties.
Taking the idea behind such findings one step further, current research is investigating to what extent playing an instrument may even encourage the development of transferable skills. For instance, the need to practise regularly may assist in the acquisition of good study habits and focused concentration, playing in concerts may encourage habits of punctuality and good organisation.
For all these reasons, there is likely to be a continuing demand for instrumental teaching in the short term. What about the longer term picture? Is there likely to be a shift in focus and, if so, what direction will it take?
While there are many possible scenarios, I believe that two possibilities are likely. Firstly, the kinds of music to which people will listen will become more diverse. New genres will develop which will integrate different styles. Secondly, there will be an increase in the use of technology to compose and perform music. This will widen access to composition as there will be less reliance on technical skill but at the same time, it is likely to further reduce the need for live performance and musicians whose role is solely related to it.
Developing in parallel with this trend is a likely increase in the number of people, across the whole age range, who wish to actively participate in music making. Such activities are likely to be community based and will reflect the musical traditions of that community whatever they may be.
If this vision of the future is to be realised, what does the music profession need to do in preparation? The focus of instrumental tuition will need to change. Ways will need to be found to enable more people to learn to play a range of instruments, throughout their life span. 
As a result, the impact on the instrumental curriculum and the measures used to assess progress through it will be such that they will need to adapt to maintain their relevance for a broader sector of the population. Ultimately, they will need to encompass a wider range of musical skills.
Crucial to the success of the process will be the training of musicians. They will need to be able to motivate, inspire and teach learners of all ages, develop skills for working with large and diverse groups and acquire the communication, social, entrepreneurial and management skills necessary for community work.
This represents a fundamental change from traditional practice and it will be accompanied by the need to respond to demands for public accountability. Viewed positively, this should provide an opportunity for all those involved in music education to demonstrate the high quality of music tuition available.

Sometimes it seems that no matter how many possessions you have, you never feel secure. While it is reasonable to have a basic nesting instinct and create a home which meets your needs, there is a point where the motivation for acquiring things gets out of control. Modern advertising is moreover deliberately designed to play on our insecurities.If you don't have one of these you will be a lesser human being is one of the consistent underlying messages we receive. To discover just how much you are influenced, I challenge you to try not to read any advertising billboards next time you go down the street. These multi-million dollar messages relentlessly condition us in very persuasive ways without our ever realising it. We are bombarded by them - television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, tee shirts, the internet, you name it - all encouraging us to buy, buy, buy.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

Weather Watch

Countless observant people without any instruments other than their own senses originally laid the foundations of meteorology, which has progressed since the 17th century into the highly technical science of today. Satellites and electronic instruments relay endless weather information to us with the minimum of delay, computers solve in minutes abstruse mathematical sums at a speed beyond the capability of the human brain. Meteorological theory is peppered with long words which have little meaning to the non-professional. It sometimes seems there is no room left for simple weather wisdom, but nothing could be further from the truth. Human experience is still the vital ingredient which translates computed data into weather forecasts.

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors' battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units.

Summer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author's Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then 'ecotourism' would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets.

48,47,"The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action.

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. 'Hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue Brown says out of the corner of her mouth. 'Very poor.' It is a classic arrival-phase error, and one that Sue has encountered scores of times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,' she protests. 'It has three red stars, and I would expect better.'
To be the possessor of red stars means that the Globe is rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide published by the organisation she works for. However, even before our frosty welcome, a chill has entered the air. Access from the car park has been via an unmanned door, operated by an impersonal buzzer, followed by a long, twisting, deserted corridor leading to the hotel entrance. 'Again, not what I had expected,' says Sue.
Could things get worse? They could. 'We seem to have no record of your booking,' announces the receptionist, in her best sing-song how-may-I-help-you voice.
It turns out that a dozen of the hotel's 15 rooms are unoccupied that night. One is on the top floor. It is not to the inspector's taste: stuffiness is one criticism, the other is a gaping panel at the back of the wardrobe, behind which is a large hole in the wall.
When she began her inspecting career, she named an early reputation for toughness. 'The Woman in Black, I was known as,' she recalls, 'which was funny, because I never used to wear black. And I've never been too tough.' Not that you would know it the next morning when, after paying her bill, she suddenly reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves.
From the look on his face, her arrival has caused terror.
Even before she says anything else, he expresses abject apologies for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocks drain there,' he sighs. 'The whole floor will probably have to come up.` Sue gently suggests that as well as sorting out the plumbing, he might also prevail upon his staff not to usher guests into the room so readily. 'Best, perhaps, to steer them to the other lounge.' she says. Greaves nods with glum enthusiasm and gamely takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months, and you can see him struggling to believe Sue when she says that this dissection of the hotel can only be for the good of the place in the long run.
Not that it's all on the negative side. Singled out for commendation are Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who dished out a sheaf of notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner, too, has done enough to maintain the hotel's two-rosette food rating, thereby encouraging Greaves to push his luck a bit. 'So what do we have to do to get three rosettes?' he enquires. Sue's suggestions include: 'Not serve a pudding that collapses.' The brief flicker of light in Greaves' eyes goes out.
It is Sue Brown's unenviable job to voice the complaints the rest of us more cowardly consumers do not have the courage to articulate. 'Sometimes one can be treading on very delicate ground. I remember, in one case, a woman rang to complain I'd got her son the sack. All I could say was the truth, which was that he'd served me apple pie with his fingers.' Comeback letters involve spurious allegations of everything, from a superior attitude to demanding bribes. 'You come to expect it after a while, but it hurts every time,' she says.
Sue is required not just to relate her findings to the hotelier verbally, but also to send them a full written report. They are, after all, paying for the privilege of her putting them straight. (There is an annual fee for inclusion in the guide.) Nevertheless, being singled out for red-star treatment makes it more than worthwhile. So it is reassuring for Greaves to hear that Sue is not going to recommend that the Globe be stripped of its red stars. That is the good news. The bad is that another inspector will be back in the course of the next two months to make sure that everything has been put right. 'Good,' smiles Greaves unconvincingly.

49,15,"Three theories about sleep 

People spend about one-third of their lives asleep. It seems certain, therefore, that sleep has a vital function. However, what that function might be is still in debate. Scientists are far from being in agreement about precisely why so much of our precious time is given over to sleep. 
There seem to be three main theories. The most popular states that the functions and purposes of sleep are primarily physiological. It claims that we sleep in order to maintain the health of our body. In other words, biological processes work hard as we sleep to repair any damage done during the day and to restore ourselves to full efficiency. However, a second theory places more emphasis on the learning benefits of sleep. This theory holds that sleep allows us to process the information that we acquire during the day, and asserts that, without sleep, learning would not take place.

50,50,"The day I drew Picasso

Richard Cork recalls how, as an 78-year-old student, he came face-to-face with one of the most revered artists of the century.

Even seen at a distance, eating his lunch at an open-air restaurant in Cannes harbour, Picasso was instantly recognisable. I was an I8-year-old student, filling in time before university by travelling round Europe and Morocco in a battered and unreliable van. Having run out of money, I found a boat-painting job on the waterfront. But I spent much of the time drawing, and was lucky enough to be carrying an ample sketchbook when my encounter with the octogenarian artist took place.
Picasso was known to be a fairly reclusive figure who spent most of his time shut away working high in the hills. So I was doubly astonished to find him seated at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three companions. Without my friend's prompting, I would never have dared to walk over and ask for his signature. Nor did I imagine, as I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, that he would comply.
But my request was generously granted. Taking the large sheet I passed over, Picasso inscribed his name across the top of the paper. Then, as if unable to resist the blankness below, he added an exuberant linear flourish on the rest of the page. But Pcasso's art, even at its least representational, was usually anchored in observed reality. So the curves may well refer to a cloud, the wind-rippled sea or the shape assumed by Cannes harbour, dominating his lunchtime vantage point.
Delighted, I thanked him and embarked on a halting conversation. Since Picasso's English was even poorer than my French, an extravagantly dressed American woman at the table acted as our interpreter. She kept describing him as the Maestro, and it was difficult to combat her gushing interjections. But I did manage to tell Picasso of my voracious interest in art and my admiration for his work.
After a while, I resumed to the boat and proudly displayed the fruit of my visit. But the friend who had encouraged me to introduce myself to Picasso could see that the lunch party was still in progress. 'Is that all?' he asked, looking at the signature. 'Why on earth don't you go back and make the most of it? You won't get a chance like this again - and he probably wouldn't mind if you drew his portrait.'
Sketchbook under arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it wise not to ask him whether he'd mind having his portrait drawn: a refusal at this stage might have wrecked the whole delicate enterprise. So I simply stood by the table, propped my pad against an ironwork screen, got out a stick of crayon and stayed to draw.
Once he noticed, Picasso grinned like an imp and made my task wickedly difficult. He acted out a range of expressions, both ridiculous and macabre - rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue and brandishing his hand in fantastical shapes on either side of his forehead. The entire performance was carried out with the gusto of an instinctive clown.
I was tempted to give up the struggle, but the sheer high spirits of my playful sitter seemed tantamount to a challenge. However obstructive his antics, I felt that he was testing my persistence, in order, perhaps, to discover the true extent of my determination.
As if to bear this out, Picasso at last relented and lapsed into repose. For a few extraordinary minutes, he deliberately gave me the chance to study him without impediment. I noticed how tough and alert he appeared, still taut in a blue-and-white striped jersey. As compact as a wrestler, the deeply tanned figure resembled an athletic 60-year-old rather than a man who would soon be celebrating his 84th birthday.
I marvelled at the youthfulness of his clear, dark eyes, set with startling intensity in features remarkably unencumbered by the folds of slack flesh on so many elderly faces. The eyes were mesmerising, and I tried to give them the necessary forcefulness. After fastening themselves on whatever they wanted to scrutinise, they did not blink until the unwavering gaze moved elsewhere.
He also seemed curiously removed and alone, even though there was plenty of company nearby. His engaging burst of buffoonery could not disguise an underlying gravity of spirit. Content to let his friends do most of the talking, he sat in a very private and absorbed silence, pursuing his own isolated interests undisturbed.
When the American lady told me that the Maestro wanted to see his portrait, I became embarrassed and replied that it wasn't good enough to show him. Picasso insisted, however, and after I passed my sketchbook over, he gave my efforts a generous nod.
Then, to my astonishment, he announced that it was now his turn. I lost no time in giving him my crayon, and his hand applied a few swift, decisive strokes to the paper. In a matter of seconds, with beguiling assurance, he outlined a bearded face below the head which had taken me so many anxious minutes to produce.
He handed the pad back, and there was a drawing blithely at odds with my dogged strivings. Picasso had moved one eye onto my nose, and summarised my smile in a single, irresistibly vivacious line. I looked like a creature who had strayed from one of his more lighthearted mythological compositions. Perhaps he saw me as an intruder from another world, peering in at him with all the gauche curiosity of a young man amazed to find himself face-to-face with an artist he venerated.
I thanked Picasso, and asked him if he would be kind enough to sign the drawing. After consultation, the American explained that the Maestro says you already have his signature. So there were limits to the generosity he was prepared to bestow on me!
All the same, I look back now and wonder at my good fortune.

Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph
The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans, screenwriter, producer and aspiring director. The year began badly when Life and Limb, a film project he had been working on for months, fell through 'almost overnight'. His disappointment mingled with stomach-churning worry: it had been two years since he had earned any money and the promise of that film had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager.
A wise man, finding himself in Evans' position, would have got a job. He could have gone back to being a television executive, or begun a television project that had been on hold. Instead, he made a decision that most people, Evans included, would consider insane. He bought a ticket to America and set off for three months to research his first novel.
Although he was acting very much on impulse, the seeds for the story had been with him for some time, sown by a farrier he met on Dartmoor while staying with a friend. The farrier had told him the story of a docile horse that had turned, no one knew why, into a fiend. Its owners were desperate until they heard of a gypsy who, simply by talking to the animal, transformed its temperament in a matter of hours. Such men, the farrier said, were known as 'horse whisperers'.
Evans' imagination was captured. He began researching the subject with a view to writing a screenplay - he was, after all, a film-maker. But disillusionment with the film world following the demise of Life and Limb prompted him to write the story as a book. And so throughout the spring he drove across the US, stopping at ranches and learning about horses and the men who work with them.
'It was a funny time,' he says now. 'I was observing people, but essentially [ was alone and I really felt as though my life was falling apart. ['d tried for ten years to make a go of it as a film-maker, and here 1was, hugely in debt and wondering how [ was going to feed the children, and thinking maybe it was all just folly.'
He thought that again towards the end of August, by which time he had returned home and written the first half of the book. 'At that point the bank manager was getting really very heavy with us, and I needed to know whether it was worth going on. I plucked up the courage to show it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was ""fine"".'
When pushed, he ventured that Evans might get $30,000 as an advance on the book. 'I had in mind how much 1 needed to payoff a bit of the overdraft and keep us going, and it was more than that. ['d spent seven months on The Horse Whisperer, and there were at least another two to go. $30,000 was a really difficult figure. I was also advised to write a 12-page synopsis of the remainder of the book.'
In October. together with the first two hundred pages of the novel. this was sent to seven UK publishers on the eve of their departure for the annual spending spree at the internationally renowned Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days his agent was on the telephone to report that he had just turned down the first offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You what?"" And he said, ""It's OK, I just sense something is happening"". '
The events that followed have become publishing history. Within a week - a week of hotly contested auctions - the novel had been sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for 5550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for 53.I5 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.
'We couldn't believe it; we sat there with our jaws gaping. W e'd never sent the manuscript to New York, we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. Nor did they send it to Hollywood, but within that same week the major studios were fighting over it. 'My agent in the UK wisely involved an agent over there and when he phoned us to say, ""I think we can get $3 million outright,"" we laughed in disbelief.'
As they all agreed to this sum, it was decided that they should each 'pitch' to Evans. And so, one night in October, he sat in his study while four great film-makers rang, one after the other, to beg for the privilege of paying 53 million for an unfinished novel. Evans told me all this as we sat drinking coffee on a wooden verandah perched above the leafy garden of his home. He said that he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay of Tile Horse Whisperer.
'It's all been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that level is a very tough business, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to find myself writing a draft or two and then have them say, ""Thanks Nick, but now we'll bring in so-and-so"". '
He would be involved, he said, but at arm's length. The success of his novel had inevitably brought forth the offer of new backing for Life and Limb, but he was no longer sure that he wanted to make it.

52,42,"Hedgehogs 

A hedgehog is a small mammal characterised by the sharp spines which cover its body. The hedgehogs are found in many different parts of the world, none is native to either America or Australia. 
All species of hedgehog share the ability to roll into a tight ball when attacked, so that their spines point outwards. The effectiveness of this as a defence mechanism, depends, of course, on the number of spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have evolved to carry out weight, and consequently, they have fewer spines and are thus more likely to attempt to run into their attacker, using their ball rolling ability as a last resort. 
Hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and sleep for much of the day, either under cover of bushes or in a hole in the ground. Despite the fact that all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all choose to do so; in suitable conditions, some will stay awake all year round.

THROUGHOUT the ages, iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination, and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers, because they were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools.
They have also been feted as artises. Eighteenth-century smiths produced the wonderfully baroque ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The sinuous metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was always the work of a talented blacksmith.
But practitioners of these ancient skills had become almost extinct in Britain by the late 1960s, for heavy industry had ceased to have any use for them, and towerblock architects rarely used anything as graceful and pleasing as a wrought-iron handrail.
Over the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a revival - thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Even so, much of the work looks surprisingly cliched: manufacturers of gates and balconies still advertise their wares as 'classical' or 'Victorian-style'. You cant walk into a trendy design store without being assailed by rusty candlesticks with dangly bits.
Thankfully, alternatives exist and a series of events over the next few weeks aims to promote the blacksmiths craft. The first of these, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the
Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says: 'We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because, in a sense, both the general public and blacksmiths have had their blinkers removed.' Power tools have liberated smiths from all that labouring over a hot anvil, and they can now bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease. 'In short,' says Dawson, 'these artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.'
About 250 pieces have been produced for the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at PS90 and climb well into four figures. Most of the money raised will go to individual makers, 'but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of good ironwork,' says Dawson.
His own contributions consist of an eight-foot gate, and a standard lamp topped with a mouth-blown glass shade.
'My style results from just allowing steel to bend and flow into shape when its hot. It's a bit like drawing with metal in space,' he says.
Many of the artists admit to being fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are relatively malleable when cold, iron and steel are a tougher, more demanding medium. Susan May, a jeweller by training, says, 'It's quite magical, because its incredibly soft when its hot, but as soon as it cools down, it becomes really rigid and immovable again.'
Ann Catrin Evans' mild steel door-knockers and handles seem to have been inspired by those bleak castles that are a stock feature of horror films. One of her designs is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. 'I love the fact that steel is cold and hard,' she says. 'And the way it feels as though its there forever.'
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security.

54,36,"Hit and miss of mass marketing

AS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite.
Advertising's problems are more fundamental, and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are. That is the principal way in which advertising has gone astray.
Think about your own shopping habits. If you visit a supermarket you may leave with 30, 40 or perhaps 50 items listed on your check-out bill, the average number of items of all kinds purchased per visit of all kinds.
Many of these will not be advertised brands; some others will be multiple purchases of the same brand. At a maximum you will have bought a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands. 
Consumer durables? Perhaps a dozen a year. Cars? If yours is a new car, the statistical likelihood is that it is supplied by your employer.
If it isn't, you only buy one every three years. And though it may seem otherwise, you do not buy that many clothes either, and most of them will not be advertised brands.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare that figure with the 32,500 branded goods and services that, according to Media Register, are advertised. Let's ignore the 23,000 which spend less than PS50,000 a year, and concentrate on the 9,500 brands that Media Register Individually lists and analyses.
Mr and Mrs Average have bought 400 of that 9,500, and not all because of their advertising. That's about 4 per cent. So you can forget that naive claim usually attributed to Lord Leverhulme: 'Half of my advertising is wasted but I've no way of knowing which half.' You could say that 96 per cent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 per cent.
When you're watching TV tonight, count how many of the commercials are for brands you buy or are likely to buy in the future. For most people the figure seems to be about one in 16 (6 per cent) so the commercials for the other 15 (94 per cent) are, on the face of it, wasted.
You probably think you're a special case, that you are impervious to advertising. Almost everyone thinks the same. But you aren't and they aren't. The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.
Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The notion that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break might immediately rush out and buy all or even many of the brands advertised is ludicrous. People register only a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest, so waste cannot be avoided. That does not mean advertising isn't cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.
Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority, because the advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments. Media advertising works, despite its much publicised expense, because it is a cheap means of mass communication.
Nonetheless, all waste is gruesome. With smart targeting the advertiser can minimise the wastage by increasing the percentage of readers or viewers who will respond; but he can never know precisely who will respond. Even the most accurate and finely tuned direct mail-shot never achieves a 100 per cent response. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling. It is possible, just, to envisage a salesman scoring with every prospective client he speaks to. The same could never happen when media are used. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.
This is as true of Birth, Marriage and Death notices as it is of soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population) is doing well. Of soap powder, the two top-selling brands in supermarkets would be delighted with a million extra customers. So that any advertising campaign, for any product (or any political party for that matter) which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful: and that, as I began by saying, is but a tiny minority of the population.

55,46,"Science flying in the face of gravity

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories.

It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft.
But appearances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel.
There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places with the air of condemned men.
For 12 months, they had competed with other students from across the continent to participate in the flight. The challenge, offered by the European Space Agency, had been to suggest imaginative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions.
Those with the best ideas won a place on this unusual flight, which is best described as the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride yet devised. For the next two hours the Boeing's flight would resemble that of an enormous bird which had lost its reason, shooting upwards towards the heavens before hurtling towards Earth.
The intention was to achieve a kind of state of grace at the top of each curve. As the pilot cuts the engines at 3,000 metres, the aircraft throws itself still higher by virtue of its own momentum before gravity takes over and it plummets earthwards again.
In the few silent seconds between ascending and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it become weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel themselves closer to the moon than the Earth. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor.
Then the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. For 20 seconds we conducted a ghostly dance in the unreal silence:the floor had become a vast trampoline, and one footstep was enough to launch us headlong towards the ceiling.
We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else.
After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.
Our first curve completed, there were those who turned green at the thought of the 29 to follow. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes 'space time' for experiments and the Dutch students were soon studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet.
At the appropriate moment the device they had built to investigate this was released, floating belly-up, and one of the students succeeded in turning it belly-down with radio-controlled movements. The next curve was nearly its last, however, when another student landed on top of it during a less well managed return to gravitational pull.
Next to the slightly stunned acrobatic robocat, a German team from the University of Aachen investigated how the quality of joins in metal is affected by the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations.
Another team of students, from Utah State University, examined the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultra-violet sunlight. Their flight was spent attempting to produce the films under microgravity. They believe that once the process is perfected, satellites could be equipped with solar sails that use the sun's radiation just as a yacht's sails use the wind. 
After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning's breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.
This was a feeling that would stay with us for a long time. 'It was an unforgettable experience,' said one of the students.

56,24,"A history of the apple

Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage.

Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC

Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as 'windings'. They had little in common with the apples we know today.

Norman knowledge 1000 AD

From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended.

Mediaeval favourites 1200

Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word 'costermonger' - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a 'great store of grafts' including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Teynham in Kent.

Settler treasure 1750

By the seventeenth century apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who sailed to Canada, Australia, die US, South Africa and New Zealand took apples and apple-pips with them, counting these among their most treasured possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Settlement, took them to South Africa and the Pilgrim Fathers who boarded the Mayflower carried them to America. In North America the most famous apple-planter was john Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted seedling nurseries from Pennsylvania in the east through Ohio into Indiana in the west. The Indians regarded him as a medicine man and his apple-tree enthusiasm, odd clothing and religious devotion - he distributed religious tracts tom in pans for widespread circulation - stayed many folktales. He was said, for example, to be so kind to Gods creatures that he even slept with bears.

Modem Delicious 1850 

About this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer called Jesse Hiatt discovered something sprouting from the roots of a dead tree. The shoot grew into an apple tree bearing a totally new apple which Hiatt named 'Hawkey'. He sent it to a fruit show and on biting into one the judge exclaimed 'Delicious, delicious!'. In 1895 the apple was introduced to the trade as a 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

Granny Smith 1850

Another of the most famous modern apples was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of transported convicts, Maria was fiercely independent, rejecting both the criminal life of her parents and the bureaucratic hypocrisy of the colonial administration. She worked as a midwife in the small township of Eastwood in New South Wales, where she was known as 'Granny-Smith' because she took on responsibility for maintaining the farm and orchard, which was the family's main source of income. One day in 1868 she found a small tree pushing its way through a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and before long was harvesting the world's first major crop of green apples, soon to be famous all over the world. When asked how the tree came about she said, 'Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish' - a comment which referred not only to the fruit but also her own convict origins.

Uniformity ales 1950

Apples are now grown all over the world from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to small luxury orchards throughout Africa. Most, though, are grown commercially and come from just half a dozen varieties - usually chosen for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. While amateur gardeners in the UK have kept many old apple varieties alive, the US has lost forever most of the apples it had 100 years ago.
But consumers are starting to demand more variety. We can't leave the responsibility of saving diversity in our apples - or any other food - up to the random selections of amateur gardeners.

57,67,"The long-distance runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans' high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. This gorgeous, if lonely and isolated, spot is Nanyuk: for the past three years it has been my base for mid-winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands.
But not once on those trips had I trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. On my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, however, I broke a personal tradition. I both competed in my first-ever race in Kenya's oxygen-thin air and stayed at Kenya's national team training camp, which is where the country's top runners prepare for their annual assault on the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited by Kenya's national team coach when I finished fifth - behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan - in the World Championship 1O,000 meters race. It was an opponunity not to be missed. Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity.
These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race!
However, I don't believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing.
But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp soon provided the answers.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
It's a fairly basic affair, though: there are few comforts. The athletes live among the college's regular students and are housed six to a room in cinder-block dormitories.
The athletes' days at the camp are dominated by three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, followed by a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily regime began at six. We crawled from our bunks and assembled to be briefed by the coaches for the morning run.
""Run easy, you have a hard job today"", we were warned as we left by the coach who'd invited me.
The total distance covered each day was about 40 kilometres - a little short of a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, with just the one scheduled run of 20 kilometres, which certainly came as a welcome respite from the rest of the week's three daily work-outs.
Running apart, life was complication-free. A splash of water on the face and a brush of the teeth sufficed for pre-breakfast preparations. Breakfast itself consisted of tea, bread and boiled eggs, taken in a sparsely-lit, small dining area.
Lunch and dinner both had a similar menu: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach and tea. When the day's running was over, in the early evening, we would pile into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya's shrinking glaciers.
By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can't be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.
I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps

58,26,"I may be too old for this lark, but here goes!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He ponders what has made him -- and others of hi sage -- take the plunge.
This summer, I quit my job and resolved to rent out my flat and go travelling in South East Asia for a yeaL You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous.
It's not as if I haven't done the travelling thing before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned. was determined to do it again some day, But you know how it is ... I fell in love, embarked on a career, bought a Hat and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realised I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in that letter of resignation, it felt as though I'd taken charge of my life again.
I now have no tics. Many of my friends are now married with children and, while they wouldn't swap places with me, they envy me my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no burning career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake!
Why am I so nervous? In the first place, 1t's a question of making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I go about organising the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go.
T'm a shocking procrastinator. and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not hang around for the start of the football season?' Severing emotional ties makes it even more difficult.
I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still cope with backpacking. Will I be able to readjust to a more basic wav of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university?
Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to disentangle themselves from the lives they've made for themselves and head ofT for foreign climes.
Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, identifies a growing awareness that adventure is there for the raking: 'The penny's dropped. The sort of people who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realising that they can have it any time they want. They just have to be brave enough and organised enough and confident enough to do it.'
1-'0I' Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, it's a chance to have a final fling before settling down. They have bought 'I round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security to have the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a niggling thought at the back of your mind that. ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'm going to be in the same position I was in before when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take, When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!'
For Matt, who'd just got out of the Army, the year he spent travelling amounted to a period of metamorphosis. 'When you're in the military, there's a set wav of doing things, a pattern to the way you approach problems. I went away because I really needed to temper this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, in order to have a reasonable existence as a civilian.'
While there are as many reasons to go travelling at my time of life as there are travellers, there do seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts and so if your contract's just come to an end you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.'
For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in the tales of 'ordinary' travellers, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. 'If you're nor happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.'
Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to come to terms with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks nor. 'It's a sign of a better educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paving the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?""
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year , does nor believe he's running away. 'It's more a case of running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself' But he does feel some trepidation. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.'
I share Ben's reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I'm nor sure I'd be making this journey if [ hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.'
It may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement.

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who discuss their different professions: the highlights, the drawbacks and their typical working day.

A. THE BRAIN SURGEON

Name: Anne

Age: 34

ANNE'S DAY

""I get up at 6.30am, go the gym at 7am, get to work by 8am and start operating at 8.30am. I operate all Monday and Wednesday, as well as some Friday afternoons. Most standard head operations take three hours, but some operations take all day. I've worked ten hours straight through on occasion without eating or going to the loo.
Deciding when to operate, and what to do, can be stressful. I don't feel particularly stressed when operating, but sometimes I worry about what I'm going to do the next day. Brain surgery tends to be a last resort for a patient, but when it works it's tremendous, and more than makes up for the unsuccessful times. From 10am to 1pm I hold an out-patients' clinic, when I explain the operations. I enjoy this and find it quite easy to talk to the patients. If they get upset, I comfort them, but time pressure can make this difficult.
I leave work between 6pm and 8pm. Some nights and weekends I'm on call, and I always carry my bleeper. On holidays, I worry for the first three days about the people I've left behind, and at night I dream I'm operating. I'm hopeless at switching off.""

B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER

Name: Marita

Age: 31

MARITA'S DAY

""I get up at Z45am, leave the house by 8.20am, take the train to work and arrive at 9.15am. At 10.30am on Monday we meet to discuss what were doing, any problems or whether anyone needs help. We work in teams - in my team there are three senior designers, a company partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. The work usually involves ten to fifteen per cent design: the rest is production. I'll be given a brief by the client - with luck the company will have clear ideas about what they want to say, their target market and the form of the project. I then spend three or four weeks designing, researching and developing the project.
After this I present my ideas to the client and once they've agreed to them, we work out estimates and budgets, and I start commissioning photographers and illustrators. I liaise with the printers and make sure the needs of the job are being met, and on time. I spend a lot of time managing people. I have to be able to communicate with a broad range of people, and briefing them correctly is essential. When their work comes in, I assemble everything and send it to the printers. Keeping several jobs going at once can send stress levels sky-high. Deadlines are always looming, and no day has a set structure.
Lunch is at 1pm for an hour, when we try to get out to the pub. Otherwise I have sandwiches and work through. It's a great feeling if the client gives a good response to the designs you've done and you know the project has worked; it's a great disappointment when you've worked really hard and the job gets rejected. I get home at 7.30pm at the earliest; often it's 8.30pm and sometimes much later. I find it hard to unwind when I get back, especially if I'm very busy.""

C. THE CHAUFFEUR

Name: Linda

Age: 42

LINDA'S DAY

""I get up at about 7am most days, but two or three mornings a week I meet a long-haul flight from Heathrow or Gatwick and get up between 4.30am and 5am. At 10.30 or 11am I might go for a bike ride, or swim. Because chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I have to watch my diet and exercise quite carefully. I usually have a big breakfast, though, and just have snacks during the day. People often ask me to recommend restaurants, nightclubs or shops, so I have to know my way around. Luckily, a lot of the jobs are pre-booked, so I get a chance to look routes up beforehand. Not everyone is polite. Some passengers are anti-social, some arrogant, some downright rude. But most of the time people are very well behaved and I've built up a good rapport with my regular clients.
There are times when I hear a conversation in the car and have to make sure my eyes are firmly on the road and my ears shut. Sometimes the press have tried to make me talk about clients I've carried, but I won't. I work a seven-day week, up to fifteen hours a day. I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to get to bed by 11pm.""

D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER

Name: Tracy

Age: 27

TRACY'S DAY

""I get up at about 7am, leave the house at 7.30am and get to my first job. My assistant and I spend most of our time maintaining gardens we originally designed and landscaped. We do a few commercial jobs but most of our work is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At about 11am we get hungry and go to a local cafe for a big breakfast. I often look at my watch and wish it was earlier and that time didn't pass so quickly. In summer I may work until 10pm; in winter until 4.30pm.
The business office is at home, so when I get back I listen to any messages and respond to any calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I'll usually arrange a consultation with them in the evening - at about 7pm or 8pm. We specialise in using old materials, such as old bricks and unusual plants, to make gardens look as if they were built a long time ago. But sometimes people have a set idea of what they want, and it can be pretty horrible. Still, its very satisfying when we do a complete landscape from start to finish and then see all the blooms come out.
It's hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business line when it rings. I never have any trouble sleeping because the work I do is so physical that I'm always exhausted at the end of the day. I wouldn't say I'm very strong, but I'm fit. Physically, it's a very tough job, but it does let your imagination run wild.""

E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER

Name: Zena

Age: 27

ZENA'S DAY

""I arrive at the site by 8.30am. I'm assistant resident engineer at the site, so I'm looking after the building of a couple of bridges and a retaining wall - which prevents people driving off the road into a quarry. I check that the contractors are working to the schedule and specifications, with correct safety systems and minimum environmental impact. I help to co-ordinate the site professionals and find solutions to any problems.
The contractors start work at 6am, so my first task is to find out from the clerk of works what's been going on since I left the night before. The rest of the day is a reaction to whatever he tells me. Usually there's some paperwork from the contractors to look at, or there might be design queries to answer.
Lunch is usually for half an hour between 2pm and 2.30pm, but I tend to grab things to eat as I go along. The contractors have set mealtimes and when they're off eating it's easier to check things on site. Because we're checking their work it can cause conflict, so our relationship has to be as open as possible. I see the duty resident engineer once a day. However, if something really important comes up I don't wait to tell them before I act.

In the mere seven million years since we humans separated from chimpanzees, we haven't had time to develop any differences: genetically we're still more than 98 per cent identical to chimps.
On this grand evolutionary scale, whatever it is that separates humans from animals is a very recent development. Our biological history implies that our physical capacity for making art (whatever changes were needed in the human physique, brain, and sense organs) and anything else we consider uniquely human must be due to just a tiny fraction of our genes.
That's a large burden to place on a relative handful of genes. It should come as no surprise, then, that modern studies of animal behaviour have been shrinking the list of attributes once considered uniquely human, so that most differences between us and animals now appear to be only matters of degree.
For example, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees (which use sticks as eating utensils and weapons), and sea otters (which crack open clams with rocks). As for language, monkeys have a simple one, with separate warning sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle' and 'snake'. These discoveries leave us with few absolute differences, other than art, between ourselves and animals. But if human art sprang from a unique genetic endowment, isn't it strange that our ancestors dispensed with it for at least the first 6.9 million of the 7 million years since they diverged from chimps?
The earliest art forms may well have been wood carvings or body painting. But if they were, we wouldn't know it, because those materials don't get preserved. Not until the Cro-Magnons, beginning around 35,000 years ago, do we have unequivocal evidence for a distinctly human art, in the form of the famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces and musical instruments.
If we're going to insist that our recent creative burst finally does set us apart, then in what ways do we claim that our art differs from the superficially similar works of animals? Three supposed distinctions are often put forward: human art is non-utilitarian, it's made for aesthetic pleasure and it's transmitted by learning rather than by genes. Let's scrutinise these claims.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless"". The implicit meaning a biologist sees behind this quip is that human an doesn't help us survive or pass on our genes -- the evident functions of most animal behaviours. Of course, much human an is utilitarian in the sense that the artist communicates something to fellow humans, but transmitting one's thoughts or feelings isn't the same as passing on one's genes. In contrast, birdsong serves the obvious functions of defending a territory or wooing a mate, and thereby transmitting genes. By this criterion human art does seem different.
The second claim -- that only human art not is motivated by aesthetic pleasure -- also seems plausible. While we can't ask robins whether they enjoy the form or beauty of their songs, it's suspicious that they sing mainly during the breeding season. Hence they're probably not singing just for aesthetic pleasure. Again, by this criterion human art seems unique.
As for human art's third distinction -- that it's a learned rather than an instinctive activity -- each human group does have distinctive art styles that surely are learned. For example, it's easy to distinguish typical songs being sung today in Tokyo and in Paris. But those stylistic differences aren't wired into the singers genes. The French and Japanese often visit each other's cities and can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some species of birds inherit the ability to produce the particular song of their species. Each of those birds would sing the right song even if it had never heard the tune. It's as if a French baby adopted by Japanese parents, flown in infancy to Tokyo and educated there, began to sing the French national anthem spontaneously.
The role of learning in human art is also clear in how quickly our an styles change. Roman authors described geese honking 2,000 years ago, as geese still do today. But humans innovate so rapidly that even a casual museum-goer would recognise almost any twentieth century painting as having been made later than, say, the Mona Lisa. Connoisseurs can do better, of course. When shown a work with which they are not familiar, they can often identify not only when it was painted but who painted it.
Yet even connoisseurs would mistake the identity of two mid-twentieth century artists named Congo and Betsy. If judged only by their works, they would probably be identified as lesser-known abstract expressionists. In fact the painters were chimpanzees. Congo did up to 33 paintings and drawings in one day, apparently for his own satisfaction, and threw a tantrum when his pencil was taken away.
Congo and Betsy were honoured by a two-chimp show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art. What's more, most of the paintings available at that show sold; plenty of human artists can't make that boast.
These paintings by our closest relatives, then, do start to blur some distinctions between human art and animal activities. Like human paintings, the ape paintings served no narrow utilitarian functions; they were produced not for material regard but only for the painter's satisfaction. You might object that human art is still different because most human artists intend their art as a means of communication. The apes, on the other hand, were so indifferent to communicating with other apes that they just discarded their paintings.

61,62,"ECCENTRICS

An eccentric is by definition someone whose behaviour is abnormal, someone who refuses to conform to the accepted norms of his society. This, of course, immediately begs the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us, after all, have our quirks and oddities. It may be a passion for entering newspaper competitions, a compulsion for collecting beer mats, a tendency to write indignant letters to the press on every conceivable subject. Eccentricity is the assertion of our individuality. Within most of us that urge is constantly in conflict with the contrary force. It is as though in the depths of our psyche we have two locomotives head-to-head on the same track, pushing against each other. One is called individualism and the other conformity and in most of us it is conformity that is the more powerful. The desire to be accepted, loved, appreciated, to feel at one with our fellows, is stronger than the desire to stand out in the crowd, to be our own man, to do our own thing.
Notice, for example, how people who have unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behaviour, tend to congregate. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organise rallies where they can get together and discuss their common enthusiasms or problems. The important word is 'common'. They look for other people with whom they can share what in the normal run of events is regarded by relatives, friends and neighbours as an oddity. A crowd, even a small crowd, is reassuring.
Probably all of us recognise a tension within ourselves between the two forces of individualism and conformity, for at the same time that most of us are going with the crowd, we tend to resent any suggestion that this is what we are doing. We feel a self-conscious need to assert our individuality as when the belligerent man at the bar informs his small audience, ""Well, I say what I think."" Or the wary stranger to whom we have just been introduced announces, ""You must take me as you find me. I don't stand on ceremony.""
Any of us can, at any time, reverse this trend. We can stoke the boiler of individualism, assert our own personality. Many people have made it to the top in their chosen professions, basically by doing just that. One example is Bob Dylan, the American singer, who has gone on record as saying, ""When you feel in your gut what you are doing and then dynamically pursue it - don't back down and don't give up - then you're going to mystify a lot of folk. But that self-conscious assertion of individuality is not eccentricity, at least not in the early stages. When a pop singer deliberately wears bizarre clothes to gain publicity, or a society hostess makes outrageous comments about her guests in order to get herself noticed in the gossip columns, that is not eccentricity. However, if the pop star and the society hostess perpetuate such activities until they become a part of themselves, until they are no longer able to return to what most of us consider 'normal behaviour', then they certainly would qualify. For the most important ingredient of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics are not people who deliberately try to be odd, they simply are odd.
The true eccentric is not merely indifferent to public opinion, he is scarcely conscious at all. He simply does what he does, because of who he is. And this marks the eccentric as essentially different from, for example, enthusiasts, practical jokers, brilliant criminals, exhibitionists and recluses. These people are all very conscious of the world around them. Much of what they do, they do in reaction to the world in which they live. Some wish to make an impression on society, some wish to escape from society, but all are very much aware of society.

62,16,"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession
A
The rules for work are changing, We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yardstick is increasingly used in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be passed over and who will not. The new rules can he used to indicate who is likely to become a star performer and who is more prone to mediocrity. And, no matter what field we work in currently, they measure the trait- that are crucial to our marketability for future jobs, These rules have little to do with what we were told at school was important. The ability to do well in examinations is largely irrelevant to this standard. The new measure takes it for granted that we all have enough intellectual ability and technical knowhow to do our jobs. It focuses instead on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness - the 'people skills' that make up what is now commonly referred to as emotional intelligence.
B
In a time when few guarantees of job security have led to the very concept of a 'job' being rapidly replaced by 'portable skills', personal qualities begin to play an important role in the workplace. Talked about loosely for decades under a variety of names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills', there is, at last, a more precise understanding of these human talents as well as a new name tor them. 'Emotional intelligence' is generally defined as the ability to monitor and regulate one's own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. In our work-life it comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships. There is a common assumption that it simply means 'being nice', However, at strategic moments it may demand not 'being nice', but rather, for example, bluntly confronting someone with the uncomfortable truth. Nor does emotional intelligence mean giving free rein to feelings - 'letting it all hang out'. Rather, it means managing feeling so that they are expressed appropriately and effectively, enabling people to work together smoothly towards their common goal.
C
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a viral component of management philosophy. And the less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters - if only because a deficiency in these abilities can hinder the use of whatever technical expertise or intellect a person may have. There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, this crucial set of emotional competencies is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.
D
Whereas one's IQ undergoes few changes, emotional intelligence continues to develop as we go through life and learn from our experiences: our competence in it can keep growing. In fact, studies that have measured people's emotional intelligence through the years show that most people grow more adept at handling their own emotions and impulses, at motivating themselves and at honing their empathy and social adroitness. There is an old-fashioned word for this growth in emotional intelligence: maturity. Not only can emotional intelligence be learnt, but individually we can add these skills to our tool kit for survival. This is especially relevant at a time when it seems a contradiction to put the words 'job' and 'stability' together. Emotional intelligence is no magic formula for uncompetitive organisations, no guarantee of more market share or a healthier bottom line.

63,2,"Tapping into a food supply

In the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the primate, the rare and elusive aye-aye, bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae. The woodpecker, of course, uses its beak for chiselling into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey; the aye-aye, on the other hand, uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Though the aye-aye's strange way of feeding was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only now discovered how it locates the insects hidden inside the wood.
Dr Carl Erickson, of Duke University's Primate Center, has been investigating the hunting skills of two captive males, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle (Animal Behaviour, vol. 41 pp. 793-802). He first tested whether they found insects just by looking for the telltale visual signs of their presence. For example, holes on the surface might indicate sites where female insects had entered the wood and laid their eggs. Dr Erickson presented the aye-ayes with logs in which he had drilled several narrow holes. Some holes led to cavities containing mealworms while others were blank dead-ends. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, gnawing through the wood and clearly not requiring the visual clues of surface holes.
Perhaps the aye-ayes were locating the mealworms by their smell or the sounds they were making. But further tests showed that they didn't use these clues either. Logs in which the smell of the insects was prevented from leaking out presented no problem, and the aye-ayes also located dead (and therefore silent) mealworms.
If they weren't seeing, smelling or hearing the insects, how were the aye-ayes able to find them? Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those containing mealworms. They could apparently sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. Dr Erickson suggests that the animal is echo-locating, listening and perhaps feeling for reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are birds, such as the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, which do probe for or glean insects from wood, and so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant. Not only can the aye-aye be regarded as a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat rolled into one, but it also behaves like a squirrel (indeed, it was originally classified as one).

JONATHON PORRITT

TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER

Jonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'.
I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot, which was great, because I like winter.
My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. Mother said, 'If you can take the time and trouble to plant it with trees then you can have it.' The idea was that we would always have a stake in New Zealand, which is a lovely idea as my father was actually brought up there. And they found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, really, but it's quite good for planting trees on.
I've always been very keen and enthusiastic about land. I'd spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and helping out in different farming jobs, and so the idea of planting trees sounded like a very nice idea, and I was immediately keen. I think the rest of the family got enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968 it was one of those winters. It rained an awful lot, endlessly in fact, and in a way it's idiotic to think back on it as such an immensely happy time as it rained pretty well most days that we were planting, and I don't suppose I've ever been wetter or colder for such a prolonged period.
There was a moment of truth every morning: getting ready for the next planting session. Coming out of the Land Rover relatively warm and dry, with the rain coming down, and your anorak still clammy from the day before, boots still sodden, hands fumbling with slippery laces.
'The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts, ideas and reflections about life.'
In that first year I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful as I'd never planted trees seriously before all this. You have a planting bag around your neck which you fill with as many trees as you possibly can, and when your bag is full it's a nightmare, and it's only as it gets lighter that life gets easier.
In a way, the most difficult bit of the entire operation was getting the lines straight. You work out what spacing you're going to plant the trees at, and then you line up a series of three poles across as long a trajectory as you can get, and those poles then determine your lines. Once you're in line, you just plant all the way down the line till you get to the end, turn around and come back again. I enjoy hard physical work, and it certainly made me fit.
After a certain point you can plant trees almost on automatic, you become used to a rhythm, and you use the minimum number of spade strokes that you need to get the hole in the ground. The rhythm is something that everybody tells you about and, of course, it's true of many agricultural jobs that you actually have to train the body into a series of quite standardised moves, and then it becomes immensely easy: so you develop an absolutely regular process of taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it in, and moving on. Mentally, it's very interesting. The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts and ideas and reflections about life - a lot of my thinking about the natural world and our place in it, all of those things that have since dominated my life, first began to pop through my head in those days.
I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees gradually grow, which has been very satisfying when you actually planted the things and you do then have a kind of stake in what happens and how they prosper.
I always dread reading in the newspapers stories of another high wind in New Zealand, or Worst Drought Ever Hits New Zealand. Such headlines make me feel extremely apprehensive. However, it worked out extremely well and those trees are now 20 years old, and in good fettle.
The only postscript I should add is that I took a term off from teaching, and I went back there in 1984, completely on my own for three months. And I wrote my first book there, Seeing Green. There's a little cabin on the tree farm which is fantastically basic, just a bed, a table and a chair. In the mornings I would do my writing; in the afternoons I would go off and prune the trees, and then do research in the evenings.
The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong.

65,1,"BOOK A

Steve Martin's Compelling Evidence is compelling indeed. The narrator, a lawyer struggling to build a new practice after being forced to leave a high-
powered law firm, finds himself manoeuvred into defending his boss's wife when she is tried for her husbands murder. The trial scenes are riveting, with the outcome in doubt right up to the verdict, and a really unexpected twist in the final pages. This is a terrific debut into a crowded genre.

BOOK B

Curtains for the Cardinal begins with a bang, and plunges the charismatic Sigismondo, troubleshooter for the aristocracy of the Italian Renaissance, into a turmoil of politics, clerical intrigue and high-wodety murder from which we are always confident he will emerge unscathed to disclose the guilty parties. The plot is convoluted and the book is about 50 pages overweight, but it is still great stuff.

BOOK C

File Under: Deceased introduces a refreshingly different new detective from a first novelist, Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, ideally positioned, it seems, for a bit of investigating when a strange man falls dead at her feet. Undaunted by attacks from various quarters - perhaps tax inspectors are used to this sort of thing - and the disapproval of her handsome local detective sergeant, gutsy, versatile Leah is a winner in every way.

BOOK D

Double Deuce by Robert B. Parker sets that most literate of private investigators, Spenser, the job of assisting his friend Hawk to clear drug dealers out of a deprived estate in rundown Boston. The slick dialogue comes almost as fast as the bullets, but there are few corpses and more philosophy than usual. High-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

BOOK E

False Prophet by Faye Kellermann, features her usual pair of detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, investigating an attack and burglary at the house of a legendary film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and eye for odd human behaviour make this an entertaining mystery.

BOOK F

Husband and wife, Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, write as a team. Blood Red, Snow White features another lawyer, another female client, but the action is all outside the courtroom and the defender finds himself becoming the victim as the plot unravels. All the classic ingredients of romance, money and violence are mixed efficiently to produce an engrossing suspense novel.

BOOK G

Dead for a Ducat by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher in a new role, that of intended victim. The hilarious collection of characters are brought together to film the story of Robin Hood, but Philip isn't the only person to feel this is not the way his career should be developing. Simon Shaw never fails to entertain, but in moving his star actor from black comedy to farce, he gives a performance below his usual high standard.

BOOK H

Fall Down Easy is Lawrence Gough's best book for some time. Canadian police hunt a versatile bank robber who preys on female bank tellers.

Health farms and country house hotels offering spa facilities report that business is booming. We asked five journalists to check out some of the places that are available.

A. HENLOW GRANGE

I welcomed the opportunity to go to Henlow Grange for six days as I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the main part of the huge 18th-century house was the most comfortable possible and I was instantly soothed.
On Day One I did nothing and slept lots. But from Day Two I started going to body conditioning and doing as many classes as I could (stretch and tone, yoga, body alignment, to name but a few). All the instructors are highly trained. I couldn't believe how supple I began to feel as the week progressed.
They have every possible treatment, including aromatherapy (I've never been so relaxed), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial, which lasts for an hour, really does make you feel like a new person.
The staff in the treatment rooms deserve a bouquet. T hey couldn't have been friendlier, nicer or more professional. The whole atmosphere is one of vitality and enthusiasm. Henlow are planning a major refurbishment this year, which will include a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available and you can ride around the grounds. If you're not feeling energetic and the weather's on your side, grab a magazine or enjoy a peaceful walk in the garden.
During my stay, my mood improved and so did my appetite. l left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted for ages. I'm definitely due another visit. This is the perfect break for the stressed working woman. Save
Room 5 for me!

B. SHRUBLAND HALL

The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was evident from the moment I climbed the vast staircase into the reception area. The Hall has an impressively decorated library, a charming conservatory and lots of space, so you don't have to speak to anyone if you don't want to.
On arrival everybody is given a medical, which includes an examination and a check on weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which I found a bit disquieting as I'm in good health. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem discovered in the examination was immediately passed on to the fitness instructor and we worked on it in the group workshops and also in an extra session of individual instruction.
Each patient is given a specific diet to follow. Although I lost weight without fasting, I was still hungry enough to develop a fierce headache on the second day. A typical daily menu for me was a breakfast of grapefruit and honey, hot lemon and boiled water; a choice of salads for lunch; and a mixture of exotic fruit, yoghurt and a flask of hot broth for supper. If you're not fasting or on a light diet, then you'll eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and nicely presented, so you needn't suffer too much! You have a massage or water therapy on alternate days. All extra treatments are competitively priced.

C. CAREYS MANOR

Careys is not a health farm and doesn't pretend to be. It's a fine old manor farm with inviting log fires and a spacious lounge. If you're counting calories, you'll have to miss out on the gourmet food. Rich sauces and delightful creamy confections are conjured up by the French chef. It's a good job the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and soft-water pool so I could work off some of the tempting indulgences. (You can opt for a 'health-conscious' diet if you really want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got an expert opinion on an old, sometimes painful, shoulder injury. The physiotherapist recommended good posture, remedial exercises and massage. Carey's manages to be comfortable and luxurious, laid-back and sedate. If you want to break out, there is great surrounding countryside to explore.

D. CLIVEDEN

Cliveden is a majestic country home and is also a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and much more. There are stunning woodland walks and gardens around the 376-acre National Trust estate.
And there's Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant with dishes to make you clutch your stomach. In ecstasy. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu; the choice was staggering. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice-cream. I climbed into bed a happy woman!
Next morning I dutifully spent a few hours in the gym playing with exercise equipment to burn off a few calories in time for my next meal. In the Pavilion I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils. Then I had an aromatherapy massage. 
I thought of all the other reports my fellow journalists would make, about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments to tone and firm the body. Cliveden has all these if you want to use them -- before indulging yourself at Waldo's.

E. SPRINGS HYDRO

The best and the worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it really is the most delicious I've ever tasted. The worst, because it's a huge slab of 360 calories, which sets you back if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the fabulous aromatherapy massage. I chose the relaxing oils blend, dropped off to sleep twice during the massage, floated back to my room and had my most refreshing night's sleep in years.
The premises are modern and purpose-built, efficiently run, with up-to-the-minute facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are plenty of therapists and beauty rooms so there's little difficulty in scheduling appointments. A variety of treatments are on offer, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are an eclectic mix -- from entire football teams to mums and daughters, best friends and singles. Ideally, I would have a break here about once a month.

67,34,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas...

It is strange how many musicians, even leading ones, come from homes without music. Out of the blue, Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of totally unmusical parents in a country district of southern Sweden, has at the age of 30 established himself as unique among the world's trumpet-players today.
His records are continually opening up new repertory, not just concertos by long-neglected composers of the baroque and classical periods, but new works too. When you meet him, bright-eyed and good-looking, he seems even younger than his years, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet.
Recently in one of London's premier concert halls he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, something of a party-piece for him, while on television a whole feature was devoted to his work and development, filmed both here and in Sweden.
Born near Malmo, he owes his career to the accident of a Christmas present when he was only eight.
His father, unmusical but liking Louis Armstrong's playing, had the idea of giving his only son a trumpet. Being a serious man, he didn't pick a toy trumpet, but took advice and bought a genuine grown-up instrument.
The success of the gift was instant. The boy never stopped playing. His mother managed to contact the second trumpet-player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, whom she persuaded to give her son lessons.
Bo Nilsson was an up-and-coming musician, and at once spotted natural talent. Hardenberger consistently blesses his luck to have got such a teacher right from the start, one who was himself so obsessed with the trumpet and trumpet-playing that he would search out and contact players all over the world, and as a 'trumpet fanatic' was 'always looking for another mouthpiece'.
There the mature Hardenberger has to draw a line between himself and his teacher. 'The trumpet is so primitive an instrument,' he explains, 'that you can't build a trumpet that is acoustically perfect. Whatever you do, it will have imperfections. Besides, you can't find two mouthpieces exactly the same. To me it is a matter of getting to know the imperfections and making a relationship with them.'
From the very start Hardenberger seems to have had the gift of finding the right compromise, and making that relationship. Without any sense of boasting, he explains that even in his boyhood years the characteristic Hardenberger sound was already recognisable, 'the first thing I acquired'.
And unlike the great British contender among virtuoso trumpet-players, John Wallace, who developed originally from a brass-band background and then through working in orchestras, Hardenberger has always thought of himself as a solo artist pure and simple.
From early boyhood he had as a role-model the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, another player who bypassed the orchestra. The boy bought all his records, and idolised him.
His parents gave him every chance to practise, and went along with his ambition to make trumpet-playing a career. It was then a question of where, at 15, he should be sent to study. America, Bo Nilsson's first choice, was thought to be too far away and too dangerous, which meant that he went instead at the age of 16 to study in Paris with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed his prejudice against going into an orchestra, saying that 'Playing in the orchestra is like digging in the garden.'
He was objective enough about himself to know that he played the trumpet better than others of his age, but it was only at the end of the first competition he entered, at the age of 17 during his first year in Paris, that he came to realise that in addition he had a particular gift of communicating.
Thibaud suggested that he should enter the competition just for experience. Hardenberger learned the pieces for the first round only, but he won through to the second. Luckily he already knew most of the pieces in that round too, but on getting through to the final he was faced with a concerto that had already daunted him. He didn't win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance, realising that though he 'played like a pig', people did listen to him.
Quoted like that, Hardenberger's realism about his work and his career may sound arrogant, but that would be a totally false impression. Thoughtfully he refuses to try and analyse what such a gift of communication might consist of, as 'You risk destroying it in trying to explain.

Women on a winning streak

To excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to just a haw brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, skier

""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well or it's windy and you can't see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

""Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I am because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming and running.
My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise.""

C. Annabel, 26, rower

""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity so the women's squad is basically a shambles. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

""At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different.
The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer

""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages.
When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!
You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been classed as eccentrics. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection always trying to get round with a perfect lap.""

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I'd really be one, c) racing is very social.
Men and women usually compete together but when an event is given coverage in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course.

Yvonne Coppard

Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game -- surveillance of a suspicious bookshop -- when she realises that one of its rare customers is her
Uncle Jim.
He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard.
When Emma finds her life in danger, things take a dark and compelling turn - her confinement in the cellar of a derelict house is stunningly handled.
This book reveals the minutiae of family life, the bonds of childhood friendship and warns that adults aren't always the protectors they ought to be. A vital and convincing read.

Backtrack

Peter Hunt

Two teenagers, 'peasant' Jack and Rill, a boarder at a posh girls school, join forces on realising that relatives of both were involved in an apparently inexplicable 1915 train accident, in which eight people died. Varied viewpoints and documents -- maps, first-hand accounts, hurt records, railway histories -- throw an ever-changing light on the incident, so that the reader works as hard as the two protagonists to understand what happened and why. A clever, complex novel which rewards close attention.

Pigeon Summer

Ann Turnbull

Mary Dyer doesn't really fit into her family or male-dominated culture; for one thing, she, a girl, loves her father's racing pigeons and when he must go away to find work, Mary knows enough to carry on managing the loft and winning prizes, despite increasing conflict with her harassed mother. Set believably in 1930, this readable tale has a sound basic message that 'There are different kinds of cleverness', which can't be bad. Thoughtful readers should find satisfaction here.

Yaxley's Cat

Robert Westall

Unusually, Robert Westall uses the viewpoint of a mature woman for this chilling story of rural prejudice and persecution. Rose, to escape from her materialistic life and her smug husband, rents Sepp Yaxley's cottage with her two children. A ferocious cat, and bizarre items found in cupboards, reveal the answer to why Yaxley disappeared, but the newcomers' presence arouses local hostility to the point where their own lives are at risk. By the end, the threatening violence is controlled, but Rose feels just as dismayed by the methodical ruthlessness of her teenage son. Utterly gripping.

Someone's Mother is Missing

Harry Mazer

At the poor, shambling, noisy end of the family there's Sam - fat, overtalkative and awed by his supercool and sophisticated cousin,
Lisa, from the apparently rich end of the clan. When Lisa's privileged world crumbles, it's Sam who helps her to find some balance, out of which both gain a better sense of reality and the value of family.
The pace is slightly slow in parts but there's a gentle humour and the developing closeness of the two teenagers is convincingly handled. It could be interesting to both boys and girls, which is a bit of a rarity.

Stanley's Aquarium

Barry Faville

Barry Faville writes with assurance and humour, vividly evoking his New Zealand setting and creating an intelligent and likeable first-person narrator. Robbie takes a jon gardening for elderly Stanley, finding him at first fascinating and later repellent; when she finds out what he keeps in his aquarium and what he plans to do with them, the book takes 'thrillerish' twist without losing its sharp insight into character and relationships. Unusual and compelling.

Dodger

Libby Gleeson

A painful, sad story where the troubled personal relationships plus the stormy school life of Mick are told though a skilful blend of flashback, a teacher's letters to a friend, the boys own notes and sympathetic narrative. Coming to terms with the negative expectations of others and his own poor sense of self-worth is achieved through a role in a school play and by an impressively sensitive first-year teacher.

70,3,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING

I thought everyone would be pleased, but one of my colleagues was absolutely furious. 'What do you mean?' she raged. 'If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?'
I suppose my inability to explain how one afternoon I had been a packet-a-day, life-long smoker, and four hours later I was not, was faintly irritating. I find it curious myself.
The stop-smoking session was an interesting mixture of group therapy and hypnotherapy and it took place exactly two months and three weeks ago.
I had not intended to stop and I did not even particularly want to. For one thing, I wholly resented the remorseless pressure from the anti-smoking mob - and I still do. For another, I had low blood pressure and a long-living and healthy family. I did not cough or feel unwell and threw off colds more easily, it seemed to me, than friends with consciously healthier lifestyles.
On that unexceptional Thursday afternoon, I had simply gone along to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about other people trying to give up. 'I shan't be trying to stop myself, it wouldn't be fair,' I announced firmly. 'Since my motivation for being here is writing, not stopping, it would not be right to expect your method to work on me.'
I could not have been more reasonable. After all, I positively enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. I thought the counsellor looked at me rather knowingly.
We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wished and most of the afternoon was conducted in a room so smoke-filled that we had to open the windows.
I noticed with interest that when I was told to smoke I was reluctant to do so -- and so were the others.
I suppose what happened was that the stop-smoking messages made intellectual sense. Just as smoking itself had become a challenge in the face of opposition, so the notion of stopping began to feel attractive.
The possibility of not being a smoker was beginning to make me feel powerful. It was a secret feeling that had nothing to do with anyone except myself. Could I also conquer the world?
In many senses, it was easy. The physical craving, the pangs of desire for nicotine, in just the same place where you feel hunger, faded after a minute or two and I experienced them over only four or five days.
The one activity - my work - that I thought would be the most difficult to accomplish without cigarettes did not cause a single problem. I had really believed that I would not be able to work to deadlines unassisted by nicotine and that for the first time ever I would fail to write a story to order.
Surprisingly, pottering around at home on weekend mornings proved to be the most difficult thing - and it still is.
I am increasingly coming to the view dat for me smoking had a great deal to do with displacing boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself.
Yes, I do miss my cigarettes, but not too much. Each 'new' experience as a non-smoker has to be addressed - eating out, waiting for an aeroplane, booking into a hotel, a theatre interval.

71,13,"The Cabinet-Maker
Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him
Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, tucked under a railway arch in East London, and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well, fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But a glance around the workshop reveals that Hurst is obviously busy, with good reason not to waste a minute of his time.
The arched space is full of half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in an amazing array of natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built up a very nice reputation for himself. His order book is always full for several months in advance, despite the fact that he does not really promote himself. Word has spread that if you want a decent cupboard or table, bookcase or kitchen units, Hurst is your man.
Of course, finding a furniture-maker is not that taxing a task. Wherever you live in the countryside, the craft is alive and well. But finding a cabinet- maker who prides himself on making beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is less easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says wearily. As a craftsman who sets himself exacting standards, he is continually disappointed by some contemporary furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He rails against shoddy, mass-produced furniture, and craftsmen who churn out second-rate pieces.
Such a quest for perfection is obviously a key to Hurst's success. That and his talent. This man is not coy about his ability. Indeed, his blatant self- confidence is as surprising as his initial brusque manner. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says, with a deadpan expression. 'I have always been good at making things.' If it were not for the self-deprecating mood into which he slipped towards the end of our interview, I would have believed his conceit to be wholly genuine.
Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says nonchalantly. Almost all of his commissions come from private individuals ('l used to do some commercial work for companies but it was soul-destroying'). Some clients have returned time and again. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he is honest enough to admit that relationships with clients do not always run smoothly. 'The most infuriating clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favourite clients are the exacting ones.'
If Hurst has every reason to be pleased with himself, he is also gracious in his praise for others - where it is due. With a sudden shot of modesty, he says: 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (the leading college of furniture design). However, he is also unremittingly critical of those craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also has little time for degree shows, in which students exhibit their work but at the same time are 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.'
Confident Hurst may be, even brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. Indeed, his parting shot displays a welcome down- to-earth approach to his craft and a streak of humility strangely at odds with his earlier self- confidence.

72,65,"Life was getting out of hand

Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour.

Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.
These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.
However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -
a PS48 call-out fee, a labour charge of PS15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.
This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.
So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.
I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.
Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were becoming too apt to collapse in front of the television, or slot in a video, I sent back the rented colour equipment and we returned to the small black-and-white portable.
It is a real strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on what is really worth watching. We now spend a lot more time walking the dog (who never liked television anyway), reading, talking or pursuing other hobbies.
One of these, in my own case, is sewing; and here is another gadget that went by the board. My old Singer sewing machine is now an ornamental plant table, and as l cannot afford to replace it, I have taken to sewing by hand.
We have come to believe that we could not do without it, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be unmanageable without the appliances of science we certainly do not want to relinquish them. Pity the generations whose lives were blighted by tedious and blister inducing toil. Even our brains are relieved of exertion by computers that not only perform miraculous calculations with amazing speed but now provide entertainment.
In fact, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the advantages are numerous. For a start, I can sew and listen to the radio - another rediscovered pleasure - or I can talk with family and friends. If it is a simple task, I can watch the programmes I do want to see on television, and alleviate my puritanical guilt at sitting in front of the box by doing something useful at the same time. And what a lovely, cosy feeling it is to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea for company.
Quite wrongly, I had tended to think with horror of the women who sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen and household items by hand. I thought of those long hours, the strain on the eyes and so on. 
There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand, a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured. I find things get done surprisingly quickly, and the pace of life suddenly slows down to the rhythm of my own hands. I am also freed from one of the most detestable aspects of late 20th century life the need to rush to finish an activity so that I can rush to the next.
Meanwhile I have regained control of my sink, where I plunge my hands into the suds and daydream while doing the washing up agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, activity.
The result of all this brooding is that I now prowl the house with a speculative eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower?

73,18,"Seven Up

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits.

My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

We were in a snow cave 91m below the summit when my climbing partner, Dougal Haston, began a conversation with Dave Clark, our Equipment Officer, about the relative merits of various sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, as only Dougal and I were present. Putting this down to oxygen deprivation, I then found myself talking to my feet. Already the cold was getting into the balls of my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. It wasn't survival that was worrying us so much as the quality of our survival.
Over the next two days I relived our time spent on the summit ridge. I realised that I couldn't have been there with a better man than Dougal Hatton. He inspired great confidence in me and by now I was climbing with a calm presentiment mat somehow or other it was all going to work out. I realised I had to get a better rhythm going in order to reach the summit - which is what I did.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. In April 1976 Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days humping equipment and food up to the base. Only after the first day of climbing did we realise the enormity of our undertaking. On the lower face we followed a route put up in 1967, but at half height we pursued a new route, as planned, heading directly for the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb
'alpine style', with our equipment and food on our backs. It would be the first time a major new route had been climbed here in such a way.
We climbed up the compressed snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and by the third day my sleeping bag was sodden. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because the air pressure in the polar regions is lower, has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. It seemed to us that we were up at around 7,000m, instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the intention of climbing Mt. Kenya. It was though the unexpected offer of a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro that we came to climb Africa's highest mountain.
On our approach we got ourselves lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. On the second day we came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool. Never before had I been so pleased to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, which is a 305m-high icicle. After a deluge of falling rock and ice we prudently retired and opted instead for the Umbwe route to gain the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a party up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route, and suggested that we go with them.
After three days of sitting out bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier stretching up to the summit had been swept by vicious winds and glistened with pure ice. With a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to miss out on the glacier. Instead we went across the north ridges towards the standard route and joined the large number of people wandering along the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit and just before it got dark we camped outside the refuge.
Back at base camp we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and felt, when they learnt that I had already climbed four, that I should do me same. This was the first time I had seriously thought about such goal-orientation -- something I had previously tried to avoid.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain towards the end of November 1992 and travelled the thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At this time of the year the sun is always well above the horizon, throughout the day and night, and when the wind stops blowing it is utterly quiet. As in other polar regions, in the keen, clean air, there is such an invigorating atmosphere that the spirits are raised just by being there. On December 7 we left camp and headed off towards the summit. Against expectations, with winds gusting at around 80 kms per hour and temperatures below minus 50degC, we all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

Our team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. 
After a few days' acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-
afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

On our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.
We had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am.

We invited four leading naturalists to tell us about the wildlife classic that has influenced them most.

At least it wasn't hard to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, one advantage of longevity is that I have had the chance to meet some of the giants who pioneered thinking in the field. Of these, none stood, indeed, still stands, taller than a small, frail woman, Barbara Ward. I can't think of anyone else more at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She has synthesised her experience of various environmental movements into her own compelling philosophy. Unwillingly 'volunteered' to cover the field, I found, as a young journalist, that she, more than anyone, made it all make sense.
Picking the book was much harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But despite its title (which sounded old-fashioned, even in 1976), The Home of Man is, to me, Barbara's most important book. Its focus is on the explosive growth of the world's cities, but its canvas is the great themes to which she devoted her life. It is as eloquent and as impassioned a plea as exists for what we would now call 'sustainable human development'. In the hundreds of books I have read since, I have yet to meet its equal.

When I open the pages of Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the long calls of herring gulls, recall the smell of the guano in the hot sun and visualise the general hullabaloo of the colony. This book explains superbly, through words and pictures, the fascinating world of animal communication.
Read Signals for Survival and then watch any gull colony, and the frenzy of activity changes from apparent chaos to a highly efficient social structure. You can see which birds are partners, where the boundaries are and, later on in the season, whole families can be recognised.
A distinguished behaviourist, Niko Tinbergen came from that rare breed of academics who wish to explain their findings to the layperson. His collaboration in this book with one of this century's most talented wildlife artists, Eric Ennion, was inspirational and has produced a book of interest to anyone with a love of wildlife. His spontaneous style of painting came from years of watching and understanding birds. With just a minimal amount of line and colour, he brings to life how one gull is an aggressor, how another shows appeasement. This is the art of a true field naturalist.

Most definitely, My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that has had the greatest influence on my life. Beyond the obvious reason that it ultimately led me to a wonderful husband, and an exciting career in conservation, this extraordinary book once and for all defined my devotion to the natural world.
I was doing research work into animal vocalisations in Madagascar when I first read the book. I had been there two years and was discouraged by the number of setbacks I was encountering but when, at the end of the day, I opened My Family and Other Animals to where I had left off the night before, the world became a brighter place. Animals, people, joy and beauty inextricably woven together - a microcosm of a world worth saving.
Many people say that our species is the worst because of the terrible things we have done to the others. But I like to think back to Gerald as a boy in My Family and Other Animals, looking at the world's inhabitants as a whole, a family whose members, be they good, bad or indifferent, are nevertheless so intertwined as to be inseparable. And that is a concept we all need to grasp.

A copy of The Shell Bird Book, by James Fisher, found its way into my school library shortly after it was first published in 1966. I was drawn to it at once, especially to the 48 colour plates of birds by Eric Ennion, painted, as the jacket puts it, ... with particular skill and charm'. It was those Ennion images which captured my attention.
I already had copies of other bird books and had spent several holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to begin sketching what I saw as an aid to identification. But in The Shell Bird Book there was so much more to feast on. As well as the glorious Ennion paintings, there were chapters on migrants and migration, a review of the history of birds in Britain, and, best of all, a chapter on birds in music, literature and art.
It was the broad span of ornithological information and the exciting images that steered me towards being more of a generalist in my appreciation of birds and the natural world. The book made it clear that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid and as possible as a rational and scientific one.

Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks again to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game.

After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older.
Chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win.
In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense: a chess clock is used to ensure that each player completes the stipulated number of moves in the allotted time - failure to do so results in immediate loss of the game. But now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. It is significant that, of the world's ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30.
Nor is it only the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess is played off the board - and not just the battle for psychological advantage that Mr Fischer wages so well. Every professional must now take seriously his pre-match preparation, not least because the age of computer databases has had a profound impact on chess. A small portable computer can hold one million chess games, and give instant access to hundreds of games of a prospective opponent.
In one recent contest, each of the protagonists employed large teams of assistants to work round the clock searching for flaws in the other's repertoire. The opening stages of a chess game are now analysed to near exhaustion. Simply being better prepared in chess opening can be the deciding factor in the game.
The chess world today boasts more first-rate players than at any stage in its history. Hundreds of grandmasters chase modest prize money the world over. Success demands physical as well as mental exertion. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension.
The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. When this occurs, each player has only seconds to make several moves or face instant forfeiture. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for reflective intellectuals. The game descends into a primeval struggle in which nerves, tenacity and an overwhelming will to win separate victor from vanquished.
At the top level of chess, the pain of losing is unbearable. Winning brings immense satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one victory is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready for the struggle the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with play on every day, and there is an all-year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more exacting. The 1984 encounter between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be aborted after several months on the grounds of mutual exhaustion. Mr Karpov had shed around two stone (10kg) in weight.
Can Mr Fischer defy these odds? He once declared ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess.""
This sentiment made his exodus from the chess world after 1972 seem even more inexplicable. But in some respects it was a fitting end to his story. It immortalised Bobby Fischer.
If he has come back for the money, he is onto a good thing. Whatever happens in his match with Mr Spassky, each will end up several million dollars richer.

Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases
A
Abyss
Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. Production design and special effects are hugely impressive. It's only the dialogue and characterisation that creak For all the craftsmanship which goes Into the film-making, the story Itself IS strictly B-movie material.
B
The Thin Red Line
The video release of this version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal directed by Andrew Marton makes a fascinating counterpart to Terrence Malick's new film. Whereas Malick's approach IS mystical and poetic, Marton made a much more conventional war movie. albeit one that is often truer to the book. He concentrated on a single soldier, and on his relationship with his abrasive sergeant. Malick's film IS Infinitely richer and more complex, but Marton's version has ItS moments. The flashback sequence, In which the soldier dreams of the wife he longs for, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus Imagery of the woman on the swing.
C
On Guard
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this corny but highly watchable swashbuckler IS a cut above most musketeer adventures It has a consummate villain In Fabrice Luchini's clammy politician, orchestrating death and destruction behind the scenes Vincent Perez makes an exuberant (If rather short-lived) hero, and while Daniel Auteuil is perhaps too moody a presence for a romp like this, he too has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film-makers peddle costume-drama cliches with so much Wit and sparkle It never seems to matter.
D
Character
A handsome but dour tale, set In turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The excessively detailed production and costume design leave the film looking like a museum piece. Taking his cue from the surroundings, Jan Decleir is endlessly morose as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who behaves ruthlessly when evICting tenants. HIS antagonistic relationship with his son IS at the core of the story, but the film-makers seem too busy laYing on the period detail to do Justice to the dark and vicious parable.
E
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
This digitally re-mastered video re-release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship to ItS best advantage. The sound editing, in particular, stands out every footstep, creaking floorboard or barking dog registers loud and clear. The storytelling IS relentlessly cruel and whenever there's a lull, It only takes a burst of Morricone's magnificent music to quicken the pulse On a moral level, there Isn't much to distinguish between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef) and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all of whom seem equally unscrupulous as they maraud across the post- Civil War West.
F
The Longest Day
'Forty-eight International stars' trumpets the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras as well, this is one pudding which is definitely over-egged The early sequences, in which the battle-hardened veterans walt for confirmation of when the invasion will happen, drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers.

Ever entered a store and come away with more than you intended to buy? We reveal the selling devices shops use that are designed to make you spend, spend, spend.

A. The image of freshness 

Supermarkets know from their market research that shoppers place a premium on fresh produce being in stores. They may place their fruit and veg at the entrance of a store, or even a display of house plants for sale, to enhance this. They may also provide an in-store bakery that wafts irresistible fresh bread smells around a large area of the store. The colour of the store's fixtures may heighten the image, too - for example, green may be used because of its association with fresh produce. The bulk of what supermarkets sell -
pre-packaged grocery items such as frozen foods and washing powders - may be quite different from this image.

B. Displaying to advantage

The location of products in the store is considered all-important in determining how well a particular brand sells. Nowhere is this more developed than in supermarkets. With computerised stock-control, supermarkets can find out the parts of the store from which shoppers will select items most often. In these areas can be found products with the highest mark-ups or ones which, though less profitable, sell very quickly. 
Traditionally in retailing, 'eye-level means 'buy-level' -- shelves at eye height are eagerly sought by manufacturers, or may be reserved for certain own-brand items. 'Dump bins' containing special offers tempt those who find it hard to resist a bargain.
Increasingly popular is 'complementation' - placing dessert or salad dressings, say, over units containing ice-creams or items that may be eaten with salads such as burgers.

C. Spreading staples around the store

Supermarkets may spread low price staples such as bread, tea and sugar around their stores and a long way from the entrance - shoppers have to pass tempting, higher-profit lines on the way. In similar vein, chainstores may locate the products they have a good reputation for as far away from the store entrance as possible. They can rely on a degree of customer loyalty towards these products, so they gamble that shoppers will go actively looking for them around the store, passing other wares that might tempt them.

D. Less sells more

Chainstores have transformed the presentation of their wares in recent years. Much of the pioneering work has been done by the Next chain, which turned away from the 'pile them high, sell them cheap' approach to popular fashion. Next stores have a 'boutique' appeal - they're noted for displaying limited fashion-wear on the shelves, giving the impression that the merchandise is exclusive. Of course, Next's clothing is not less mass-produced than that of their rivals - the company's success is as much a testament to good store design as it is to well-designed clothing.

E. Tempting totals

Food shoppers, it seems, are more responsive to the overall size of their weekly or fortnightly bill than to the prices of individual items. Supermarkets take advantage of this by stocking a mix of low mark-up staples and high mark-up items, so it shouldn't be assumed everything that a supermarket sells is cheap. Low prices are of direct appeal to the thrifty shopper.
It's often said that supermarkets deliberately lose money on certain staples to draw shoppers in - known as 'loss leaders'. More commonly, their low prices are achieved by buying in huge quantities from manufacturers, by offering them a prominent place to display their products or by exceeding sales targets - all of which attract big discounts from the manufacturers.

F. The all-important price-tag

Shoppers tend to buy fewer items in chainstores and may be more aware of individual pricing as a result. So the importance of pricing, say, a blouse at PS14.99 as opposed to PS15, still holds. (It's also a useful device, apparently, to reduce theft among the shop's own staff, who are obliged to ring up a sale in order to give the penny change.)

G. Lighting to effect

Both supermarkets and chainstores give careful thought to lighting. With chainstores, the aim is to achieve lighting which is as close to natural light as possible so that shoppers get a fair idea of what the colour of the clothes will be like in daylight. With supermarkets, special lighting (and mirrors) may be used to enhance certain foods, particularly fresh fruit and veg.

H. Walk this way

Many chainstores have divided up their floors with different carpeting - one pattern for the routes through a store and one defining sales areas. Shoppers are drawn naturally along these routes known within the trade as the 'Yellow Brick Road'. It's not always successful - some shoppers are reluctant to stray off the routes into the sales areas. Marks and Spencer for example, use wood or marble covering for routes, encouraging shoppers to walk on to the more welcoming carpet in sales areas.

I. In-store promotion

As you enter a supermarket, giant colour photographs of succulent roasts, fancy cakes and cheeses hit you - irresistible if you've had nothing to eat before setting out on your shopping trip. In the United States, 'video trolleys' are being tried out in a number of supermarkets. Each trolley has a screen which advertises products as you shop. Sensors at the end of shelves trigger relevant advertising - so the shopper passing the cook-chill cabinets, say, may receive an ad on the screen for ready-made moussaka.

78,7,"From here to paternity

A. The theatre director

Because of my bizarre personal life, which I cannot be proud of, I have been blessed with 35 years of small children and I can honestly say I have loved every minute. I had the pleasure of feeding the baby this morning and that for me is what being a father is all about.
I'm terribly lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, music. It creates a great bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become a friend rather than a father.
I don't believe in physical violence. I have been guilty of slapping my children in anger, but I don't condone it. I'm sure I have not been a deeply attentive father but I have always tried to be available. I'm here if they need me, always on the basis that they ring me. As soon as you start chasing them to ask why they have not been in touch, you impose this terrible burden of guilt. My parents did it to me and I would never do it to my children.

B. The advertising executive 

I was young when they were born, only around 25, and I admit I found the responsibilities and limitations quite irksome. It aged me quickly, but at the same time it kept me young, which is something I have always valued. 
As they became teenagers, they introduced me to things I could have drifted away from: music, youth culture, clothes. In a funny way that has been invaluable as far as running the agency has been concerned. I have never felt out of touch. 
Because I was struggling to establish the business when they were young there were things I missed: first concerts, sports days. I'm sad about that, but there are compensations now, like being able to take them on holidays to the south of France.
They get on well with a lot of our friends and they come to parties with us and advertising awards ceremonies without feeling intimidated. I think it has been an advantage that I do something they see as glamorous and interesting.

C. The politician

My first child was born just as I was about to be elected onto the Greater London Council, and the others followed in quite quick succession. My wife and I vowed that we would carve out time for them but since I have become more and more politically active, time has become a real problem. 
I make it a condition that I will only accept weekend meetings and public appearances where there are facilities for one or more of the kids to come with me. If I did not they would just get squeezed out. This way they have a sense of what I do when I am not with them and there is no feeling of Daddy disappearing.
I've noticed more and more MPs bringing their kids to the House. Maybe we are all becoming more conscious of the need to involve our children in our lives.

D. The writer

My first marriage broke up when Kate and Bonnie were quite young, so I was forced to examine the whole area of fatherhood more closely than I might otherwise have done. I made enormous efforts to stay in touch with the children. My ex-wife and I even experimented with living next door to each other for a while, so they could come and go as they wished, but I think Kate and Bonnie would say now that they found that quite confusing.
Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a very good father. It is true I was around a lot, but, like a lot of Seventies parents, I think I treated the kids as adults too soon. Kate was complaining only the other day that we were too liberal. I think I could have introduced more systems, more order. Instead I took this very loose approach. I regret that now.
I still worry about my elder daughters as much as I do about my youngest. In that way your kids never leave you.

E. The TV presenter

I was ready for kids. I'd hit 30, met my wife, we had a lovely house, so we thought, ""Why carry on going to the shops every Saturday spending our money on new sofas, when we could have a kid instead?""
Having my daughter Betty has forced me to come to terms with who I am and what I am. You feel you are doing something very special when you conceive a child, and you are. But you are also becoming just one more parent in a great long line of parents. It's a great leveller.
I do resent it occasionally but if ever there is a moment of irritation, it is dispelled by just one look at her. A baby's smile is the greatest self-preservation mechanism in the world.

Transition. It's a pleasant word and a calming concept. Change may frighten some and challenge others. But transition means going surely and sweetly from somewhere present to somewhere future. Unless, that is, it is newspapers' 'transition' to the online world, an uncertain and highly uncomfortable process - because, frankly, it may not be a process at all. 
But surely (you say) it is bound to happen eventually. Everybody knows that print newspaper sales are plummeting while visits to the same papers' websites keep on soaring. Just look at the latest print circulation figures. The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and many of the rest are down overall between 8% and 10% year-on-year, but their websites go ever higher. 
All of which may well be true, depending on timing, demography, geography and more. After all, everyone - from web academics to print analysts - says so. Yet pause for a while and count a few little things that don't quite fit.
So if sales in that area have fallen so little, perhaps the crisis mostly affects newspapers? Yet again, though, the messages are oddly mixed. The latest survey of trends by the World Association of Newspapers shows that global circulation rose 1.1% last year (to 512 million copies a day). Sales in the West dropped back but Asia more than made up the difference. 
As for news and current affairs magazines - which you'd expect to find in the eye of the digital storm - they had a 5.4% increase to report. In short, on both sides of the Atlantic, although some magazine areas went down, many showed rapid growth. 
You can discover a similar phenomenon when it comes to books. Kindle and similar e-readers are booming, with sales up massively this year. The apparent first step of transition couldn't be clearer. 
Yet, when booksellers examined the value of the physical books they sold over the last six months, they found it just 0.4% down. Screen or paper, then? It wasn't one or the other: it was both. 
Tales like these of young people abandoning newspaper-reading are wildly exaggerated. Turn to the latest National Readership Survey figures and you'll find nearly 5,000,000 people aged between 15 and 35 following the main national dailies. 
And even within Europe, different countries have different stories to tell. There's Britain, with a 10.8% drop in recent years (and a 19.6% fall for quality papers), but in Germany the decline has only been 7% all round - with a mere 0.8% lost to quality titles. And France shows only a 3.1% fall (0.8% at the quality end of the market). 
Such varying national trends may well reflect a situation far more complicated than the prophets of digital revolution assume. America's media analysts used to argue that booming online advertising revenues would pay for change and, along with lower production costs, make online newspapers a natural success. But now, with digital advertisements on newspaper sites actually dropping back, such assumptions seem like history. 
Already 360 US papers - including most of the biggest and best - have built paywalls around their products. However, the best way of attracting a paying readership appears to be a deal that offers the print copy and digital access as some kind of joint package. 
In other words, print is also a crucial tool in selling internet subscriptions. And its advertising rates raise between nine and ten times more money than online. 
Of course this huge difference isn't good news for newspaper companies, as maintaining both an active website and an active print edition is difficult, complex and expensive.

80,64,"Ordinary people, ordinary lives

Most of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like, the sort of people they were in their youth? The glimpses rare diaries give us are frustratingly incomplete, family anecdotes only half remembered. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often intend to write things down, but never get round to it. We may leave videos rather than photographs, but the images will remain two-dimensional.
Hannah Renier has come up with an answer: she writes other people's autobiographies, producing a hardback book of at least 20,000 words -- with illustrations if required - a chronicle not of the famous, but of the ordinary.
The idea came to her when she talked to members of her family and realised how much of the past that was part of her own life was disappearing. 
""When I started I didn't take it nearly so seriously as I do now, having met people who genuinely will talk and have led interesting lives,"" she says. ""They would say they are doing it for their children or for posterity, but they are getting quite a lot out of it themselves. They enjoy doing it.""
The assurance of confidentiality encourages her subjects to overcome any instinct of self-censorship. 
""I had the confidence to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who made and lost one fortune before making another. ""I was surprised at what came out. There were things that hurt, like my divorce, and the pain was still there.""
""I did it for my family, so that perhaps they could learn something, but I have not yet let my children - who are in their thirties - read it. They were hurt by things in my life and there are a lot of details which I don't feel I want them to know at the moment. If they insist, I'll let them. But I think I'd rather they read it after I was dead.""
He also recognised patterns laid down in childhood, which showed themselves in repeatedly making the same mistakes. It is something Ms Renier has detected in other people. ""It's amazing how many people really have been conditioned by their parents,"" she says. ""The injunctions and encouragements that were laid down in childhood have effects for the rest of their lives. They become caught in repeating patterns of behaviour. They marry the sort of people of whom their parents approved -- or go in the opposite direction as a sort of rebellion.""
""A lot of disappointments come out. Sixty years later they still are regretting or resenting things that were never resolved with their parents. There is no age of reason. If people had hang-ups in their youth, they still have them in middle age. They live their lives in an attempt to impress a parent who wasn't impressed and if that fails some of them seem to be seeking permission to say 'I can't stand my mother'.""
Recorder rather than inquisitor, Ms Renier keeps her distance. ""It's not for public consumption and I'm not there as a very nosy person. People have got carried away and told me something, then said, 'I'm not sure if that ought to go in'. I put it in anyway - they can remove things when they see the draft. But generally people want to be honest, warts and all.""
""It's not vanity publishing, it's not people saying 'Gosh, I've had such an interesting life the world's got to know about it.' Things are moving much faster than at any time in history and we are losing sight of what happened in the past. It's a way of giving roots. We need some sort of link to our ancestors because people don't sit around in an extended family any more. People want a little immortality.""
Each book involves up to 30 hours of taped interviews which Ms Renier uses as the basis to write the life story, rearranging the chronology and interpreting. Modern technology allows her to produce everything except the binding with its gold lettering: choose your own colour of library buckram, pick your own title.
Fascinating to the private audience at which each book is aimed, the results are obviously not of the dirt-at-any-cost school of life story. Ms Renier organises her material logically and writes well, the final content is as good as its subject. The hook that emerges does not look like a cheap product - and carries a price tag of nearly PS3,000, with extra copies at PS25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the cost - inevitable with the time involved -- clearly deters many people.
""I thought it would be a more downmarket product than it is,"" she says.

A. INDIA

GIIANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN

Ghanerao Hotel sits at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small rural village dominated by craftsmen. It mixes English country-house tranquillity with Indian symbolism. The Ghanerao family have lived there for 400 years and today, Sajjan Singh and his wife have opened their home to paying guests. The facilities are basic, with hot water arriving by bucket, but the spartan aspects of life at Ghanerao just add to its appeal.

B. NEW ZEALAND

HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK

One of my favourite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zcaland's South Island which I came across by chance when I was climbing. We had been flown up to near the top of a glacier and had climbed to the peak and then had to walk all the way down. When we finally reached the bottom, to my astonishment, there was this hotel. It was on its own in the most stupendously beautiful countryside, very wild and very high up. To come down the mountain battered and exhausted and find yourself in extreme luxury, with a man playing Cole Porter on the piano, was extraordinary.

C. MAURITIUS

BEACI ICOMBER PARADIS HOTEL

On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is isolated on its own peninsula in one of the quietest corners of the island. If you drive from here, the road winds along the coast past beaches with no-one on them but fishermen.
The hotel isn't small and there are plenty of takers for the free watersports, but you can easily escape from all the other people along nine kilometres of private beach; you have only to swim a few yards out into the Indian Ocean and you can barely see the hotel for palm trees. Sit on the beach in the evening when everyone has gone and as the light drains from the sky you'll feel far away from everything.

D. ST LUCIA

LADERA HOTEL, ST LUCIA

The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the Caribbean's most dramatic settings. Quiet and far off the beaten track, it stands at an altitude of 1,000 feet, its open rooms looking out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea some view first thing in the morning! The style is colonial, with furniture in mahogany and greenheart wood, and four-poster beds screened with muslin netting.

E. TURKEY

THE SPLENDID HOTEL, INSTANBUL

This hotel, on Buyukada in the Princes Islands is the perfect place to escape the noise of Istanbul. The islands are only an hour by boat, and are simply idyllic. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and fabulous twenties wooden architecture. The islands are a cross between Key West and the Old South, and the landmark building is the Splendid. All in wood, painted white with red domes, it's a copy of a turn-of-the-century hotel on the French Riviera. Today it's a little run down, but has lost none of its charm.

F. FRANCE

CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY

In the tiny village of Etoges, in the heart of Champagne, is a beautiful seventeenth century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, the chateau, until recently a family home, has 20 rooms which are all different, some with four-poster beds - one even has a large billiard table. There are special weekend rates for two nights with breakfast and dinner plus complimentary champagne (their own brand - if you want to take some home).

G. KENYA

THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI

The Fairview is that rare bird in Africa - a comfortable hotel that hasn't decked itself out in feathers of upmarket gloss and tasteless luxury. It's an indispensable staging post, always full of travellers recuperating from one safari and planning the next. Overnight guests have been known to arrive, take one look at the gardens, the bedrooms and the dining-hall menu, and decide on the spot to stay for a week. There are even apartments set aside specially for those who make up their minds to settle in for a few months. The hotel's leafy acres and scattered buildings are laid out on Nairobi Hill, a world away from the overhead bustle of the city centre. I don't know of any better place to sit and watch the sudden African sunset, sipping draught beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner - braised zebra and two veg, following by jelly trifle.

H. ITALY

HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO

The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the visitors hook at the Hotel Splendido. Ever since, a galaxy of the fabulous has drifted in and out of the hotel's portals to play, stay and be seen: Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Nowadays, you are more likely to find yourself in the company of a soft drinks billionaire or a rubber-tyre heiress. But this old Monastery-turned-villa-turned-hotel is still, as its name suggests, quite splendid and there is enough reflected glamour to perk up any weekend break.

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some of the new British talent, from poet to pop star, heading for the top
A
Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, is the author of three critically acclaimed plays. He is currently adapting his first play, Peaches, into a screenplay. 'It's low budget but we don't know how low,' he explains. 'It certainly won't be over PS30 million, but then it could be 30 quid.'
Although obviously gifted, the most extraordinary thing about Nick is that before he wrote Peaches he had never been to or read a play in his life, 'When I wrote the play, I never even imagined it would get put on,' he says. 'It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the logistical problems. I knew absolutely nothing then.'
He left school at 16, only to return a year later, After A-levels, he enrolled at the Young People's Theatre, 'I realised I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard rather than read because of the rhythm and rhyme,' he says, 'Suddenly I was surrounded by like-minded people. It was the first time I'd been in an educational environment and actually enjoyed myself. It was very stimulating.'

Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has come a long way in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a television comedy series, and has just finished a punishing tour around the country with comedy star Steve Coogan,
He's always worked hard, Even as far back as Bristol, he was honing his art in comedy clubs. 'It was very theoretical at university,' remembers Simon, 'It made me realise I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy, People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and you've got good material, it's a wonderful thing to make people laugh.'
He has performed with the comic am Funny Business, but his relationship with Steve Coogan that has proved the most fruitful. 'He saw my show and, as I was a huge fan of his, he could probably see me mimicking him,' admits Simon. 'It was comedy clubs. 'It was very theoretical at university.' remembers Simon, 'It made me realise I didn't want to be a straight actor and that I'd always been more interested in comedy. People think that comedy is the hardest job in the world and it really isn't. If you've got the courage and you've got good material, it's a wonderful thing to make people laugh.'

Ciaran McMenamin, 24, came to the public's attention when he disco-danced into their living rooms as the lead in the series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star, The critical reaction was extremely positive and his subsequent rise has been meteoric. 'It's been a really good showcase for me,' he says with a smile, 'I'm now in a situation where I can pick and choose what I do, which is what I've always wanted.' It is an unusually comfortable position to be in, especially when you consider that he has only just graduated, But glance at Ciaran's early career, and it's obvious such recognition was always on the cards.
Encouraged by his mother, he went from playing lead roles at school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years, 'Basically I was using acting as an excuse not to do homework,' laughs Ciaran. 'But I suddenly decided I wanted to make a go of it because I had a knack for it, and a passion for it.'
Now he is more or less sitting back and waiting for the plaudits to roll in - but ask him what he thinks of the fame game and he suddenly becomes pensive, 'When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and the interviews but you soon realise it's not what you're acting for. It's not about that, It's about getting respect for doing good work.'

Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer in the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three- album deal with Domino Records, Neil and the other half of Matrix, Rick Brown, are already tipped to be huge when their single, Chimera, is released shortly, 'The record company's idea of good sales is very different to mine,' he says, 'They're talking smash hit, but I've no idea, For me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy.'
Unlike so many new pop sensations, Neil has actually worked very hard for his success, He left school at 16 and has been trying to break into the music business ever since, 'It's funny how things happen,' he says, 'I'd been slogging away doing student gigs for eight years and I was starting to get a bit jaded, I was just about to give up when this happened.' By 'this' he means meeting Rick Brown, who already had contacts at Domino, and forming Matrix, It couldn't have happened at a better time, 'There were times when I was thoroughly depressed - and I've been in some atrocious bands, But hopefully it will all have been worth it.'

Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more prizes, awards and academic honours than anyone twice his age, He is already well known on the poetry circuit, where he has been touring and giving several readings a week for the past six years, Now his first novel, Hidden, will be published in March, 'It's a story of obsessive love. It was a very strong idea that I couldn't do as a poem.'
Stephen was a huge fan of creative writing at school, but became disenchanted with education later on, 'I decided not to go to university but it wasn't until I became very bored with stuffing envelopes at a theatre that I decided I should.' After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992, 'I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer - they always thought I'd be a reader because that's all I did as a child.' With his poetry receiving such critical acclaim, his move into novels is indeed brave. 'There's a framework with my poetry and less scope for me to do something hideously wrong,' he explains. 'Because a novel can be any length of words, there are more words that could be bad words.

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I'd been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin's skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn't really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin's life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I'd almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition.

CHARLES SPENCER

A. Tamburlaine the Great

Marlowe's ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands' staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe's play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher is in terrific form in the title role, somersaulting from the balcony, sliding down a rope head-first as he delivers a speech, demanding and getting the audience's complete attention as his eyes glint with a mad lust for power and glory. Great stuff.
Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

B. Women Laughing

Welcome London transfer for the late Michael Wall's fine play, seen at the Manchester Royal Exchange in May. The first act creates an atmosphere of unsettling menace as two married couples chat on a sunny suburban lawn. In the second half the location shifts and the piece becomes a powerful, compassionate study of the devastating effects of illness. The British theatre lost a talent of great promise when Wall died at the tragically early age of 44.
Royal Court Theatre, London SW1 (0207 730 1745)

C. Amphibians

Billy Roche is the latest in the long line of Irish dramatists to have enriched the English stage. All his plays to date have been set in his native Wexford, and this latest piece explores the decline of the fishing industry with his usual mixture of rich characterisation, painful emotion and sudden moments of quirky humour. The play sprawls a bit aimlessly at times, but builds to a blistering climax.
Barbican 3 Pit Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

D. Murder by Misadventure

Traditional thriller involving our old friend, 'the perfect murder'. This time it is Gerald Harper and William Gaunt who play the crime-writing partnership intent on killing each other, and though its all rather familiar stuff; the twists and turns are handled with ingenuity.
Whitehall Theatre, London SW1 (0207 867 1119)

E. The Alchemist

Young director Sam Mendes finds the gold in Jonson's great comedy of 17th-century confidence tricksters. First seen at the Swan in Stratford last year, the show works just as well on the Barbican's main stage, with Jonathan Hyde, David Bradley and Joanne Pearce repeating their fine performances as the wicked trio of con-artists.
Barbican Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

F. The Madras House

Peter James' production of Harley Granville Barkers rich, panoramic comedy about fashion and the position of women in Edwardian society transfers to London after its success at the Edinburgh Festival. The staging is stylish, the acting excellent, the play itself an unjustly neglected classic.
Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, London W6 (0208 741 2311)

G. Dreams from a summer house

This delightful new musical finds playwright Alan Ayckbourn in unusually benign form as he relocates the Beauty and the Beast story deep in the heart of London suburbia. A lush score by John Pattison and an unashamedly schmaltzy celebration of romantic love combine to make this good-hearted show a real winner. London impresarios looking for a hit should board the next train to Scarborough.
Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough (01 723 370541)

H. The Merry Wives of Windsor

David Thacker's lacklustre production of Shakespeare's most farcical comedy came perilously close to being awarded the dreaded thumbs-down symbol, but this disappointing, crudely designed show is redeemed by first-rate comic performances from Ron Cook as the French physician Dr Caius and Anton Lesser as the explosively jealous husband, Ford. Almost everyone else looks faintly embarrassed, as well they might.
Shakespeare Theatre, Stragford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

I. The Voysey Inheritance

Another major Granville Barker revival, now touring the regions. This story of an apparently respectable solicitor who bequeaths a corrupt financial legacy to his son results in a marvellous play.

Six people talk about their typical working day

A. Credit Card Executive

I get up at 6 am to arrive at the office around 7.30 am. I manage all the customer development programmes for our regular credit card users. My responsibilities include the launch and management of the Membership Rewards scheme in the major European markets. I have to keep in touch with existing card users, acquire new ones and build relationships with partner companies.
I use the first 45 minutes to organise my day and then I respond to any e-mail messages. I manage all the advertising for the membership programme across Europe, so I meet with our marketing staff and the advertising agencies to establish a strategy and work on future developments. I have meetings scheduled for most of the day, but at all other times I make sure I keep my door open for anyone to come and ask me questions.
There are nine customer service units around Europe and I have to travel to the different markets once or twice a week to discuss issues that come up. When I'm in London, I leave work between 6.30 pm and 7.00 pm.

B. Record Company Executive

I get to work for 10.00 am and go through the post - between ten and twenty demonstration tapes a day, letters from producers and information about concerts, as well as invoices from session musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing at about 10.30 am - producers, publishers and so on, and there are meetings arranged throughout the day to talk about campaigns or projects for a particular artist. This might involve the press, marketing and the managing director.
When I listen to demo tapes I am very aware that people are bringing in their life's work, so I try to be constructive. I instinctively know if the sound is appropriate for our record label. Once I've signed a band, we start on the first album - choosing the songs, producer, and additional musicians. Then I have to communicate my vision of the album to the rest of the company for marketing and selling. I also oversee budgets and spending.
I leave work at 7.00 pm at the earliest and most evenings I go to gigs - sometimes I see as many as five new groups a night. Sometimes after a gig I'll visit an artist in the studio. Most of my socialising evolves around my work. I often don't get home until 1.00 am - when I put on a record to help me wind down.

C. Sales Director

I get up at 8.00 am and drive to work to arrive at 9.30 am. I open the post, look through the diary to check if we're going to see any clients that day, then wait and see who turns up.
I love taking people round the showrooms - there's nothing better than reaching an agreement with someone, selling them a piece of furniture and knowing it's going to a good home. We sell antiques from PS1,000 to PS6,000 and buy from the London salerooms, country house sales, our private clients and overseas.
A lot of what we buy needs restoration. We have a full-time restorer in the shop, and I spend a lot of time liaising with gilders, picture framers and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while I drink coffee at odd moments, to keep in touch with what's going on in the business, and I often pop into the Victoria and Albert museum to compare furniture.
I do the accounts one day every month and every three months I do the tax returns. At 5.30 pm I go home. It usually takes me about an hour to switch off.

D. Air Traffic Controller

I work a set shift pattern, and when I'm on an early shift I leave the house at 6.00 am. At 7.00 am I relieve the night shift and take over one of the four control positions in the tower.
We have a rotating timetable, which means that I work for about an hour and a half at one of the stations, go off for half an hour and then come back to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor and the watch manager all sit near to each other and work as a team, controlling the aircraft movements.
In winter we deal with about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are much quieter, and I usually get a chance to read up on new air traffic requirements between 12 and 4.00 am.
It's important to be really switched on in this job, so even if I'm only a bit under the weather I have no qualms about being off sick. I find the work quite stressful and it can take a while to wind down at the end of a shift. Eventually I'd like to be watch manager, and then maybe even general manager of the airport.

E. Shop Manager

If I'm on an early shift, I leave the house by 8.00 am. The first thing I do is get the electronic point-of-sale system up and running.
I always make sure there's someone to watch the till and I co-ordinate people's lunches and breaks. I spend the morning helping customers, finding and ordering books for them. I enjoy serving customers, although it can be a bit annoying if they come in waving reviews and expect you to run around gathering a pile of books for them.
Between 2.00 pm and 4.00 pm most weekdays, publishers' reps come into the shop and I spend some time discussing new titles for the months ahead. I have to consider how many, if any, of a particular title the shop is likely to sell. When we want to feature a new title, it's essential that I make sure it's delivered in time.
The early shift finishes at 5.45 pm. Two days a week I do a late shift, and then I close down the computer system, lock up and go home.

F. Financial Analyst

I listen to the news at 7.00 am, then get up and take a taxi to arrive at work at 8.45 am. First I get in touch with our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in the region I'm responsible for.
I assess financial risk for multi-national companies operating abroad, so it is my job to try to warn clients well in advance of anything that could go wrong in that country. I provide three services: an on-line executive preview, or newsflash; a security forecast, which is an extended preview plus a forecast for the next six months; and a travel information security guide.
From 9.15 am to 9.30 am I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I'm going to follow. My first executive preview has to be on-line by 10.00 am and my second deadline is 11.00 am, so I have to be quick chasing up stories. I type them, send them through to my editor, who edits and approves them, then I re-check and make any necessary alterations before they go through the system. 
I travel to Africa about three times a year, to report on specific events or just to keep up with what is happening. I leave work at around 6.00 pm.

86,9,"BRINGING UP BADGERS

'What now?' was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an 'open farm' six years ago, we've established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box -- a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.
I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her.
I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours.
Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute 'mum', they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.
The vets post mortem revealed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle feeding any animal it is important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can overflow into the lungs. In Willows case this had caused an infection that would have been difficult to rectify, even with the help of antibiotics, in one so small.
Disheartened by my failure, I continued rearing the others. But fate works in strange ways: six days later a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. Behind some silage bags he had discovered a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return; the area had been disturbed too much and already the cub was cold and hungry.
Willow II joined the fold. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females and over the next few days I discovered why his mother had left him. Never had anything been so difficult to feed. To place the bottles teat in his mouth and cajole him into drinking I had to keep moving it around and squeezing it. After a full 10 minutes he would latch on to it as if he had not drunk all day. By the end of April the females were weaned on to creamed rice and then literally anything. It was to be a different story for Willow. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food, tipping it over or just sitting in it. Eventually I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages he was ready to move on to something else.
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast; a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. The usual diet for badgers is 60 per cent earthworms, plus beetles and bugs, baby rabbits, mice and voles and even shoots or roots of plants. Certainly my badgers were much better off than other cubs that year; the summer was exceptionally hot and digging for earthworms must have been almost impossible.
By August my foundlings had begun to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the cider orchard; in its long grass, everyone was fair game. The cubs would get excited, ruffle up their fur so that they looked like snowballs and chase each other's tails. As 'human badgers' we were included in this sport. I learnt to avoid those playful charges that ended with a sharp nip, but Derek accompanied us only occasionally and so never grasped this skill: his reactions to being caught were sometimes as colourful as his bruises.
It was during two of these late-night walks in the very dry period that I spotted odder badgers in our field. Presumably they were having to extend their territories to find enough food, although badgers are very territorial and will kill others that wander into their territory. We were even warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so sheet metal was placed over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers, and such was the response that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With advice freely given, we designed our badgers' new home. Daniel, one of our sons, drew up the plans and we built a sett complete with tunnels, an enclosure and a badger gate facing the same way as their nightly walks.
It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. As the sett began to take shape, the badgers would explore it before going on their walks. Eventually walks were forgotten in the excitement of climbing through the tunnels and sorting out bedding.
The cost of the building work was far more than we envisaged but a local bus company (the aptly named Badgerline) sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated building materials. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own.
Early one evening they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later I crept back to see if all was well, to be met with the sight of three badgers curled up in their chambers sound asleep.
These days my walks with them are not as regular, especially as they are not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally (she has joined a neighbouring sett) but
Bluebell and Willow II still rush up to say hello before they go dashing off into the night.

87,4,"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?

Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Some GPs, midwives and physios use it regularly for pain relief.

A. What's it all about? 

Traditional Chinese medicine sees health as a state in which the energy of the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. According to the theory, energy or Qi (pronounced chee) flows around the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each linked to an internal organ, and lots of tiny meridians take Qi to every cell. When the flow of Oi is upset, blocked or weakened, the body is said to be out of balance: weakness or illness may result. During a consultation with a traditional acupuncturist, he or she will try to find where imbalances occur in the Qi. This is done by feeling pulses on your wrist, examining your tongue and assessing your general appearance. He or she will ask about your medical history, current health, general well-being, state of mind, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin. He or she may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

B. Over three hundred points
 
The points used for acupuncture are related to meridians so won't necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often say they feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated. This is either done by hand or by attaching the needle to an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this sensation shows the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian.
There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

C. Science tells us how

Without accepting the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, doctors here have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief. This is because they have been able to provide scientific explanations of how it might work. For example: 
* It has been suggested that stimulating particular nerves blocks pain signals and stops them from reaching the brain.
* Some scientists believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances (endorphins).

D. What type of pain can be treated?

Many people with chronic long-term pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine and post-operative pain are commonly treated with acupuncture.
Other types of pain which acupuncturists claim to treat include menstrual pain, facial nerve pain and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

E. Modern use for an ancient treatment

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, one development has been rather more recent. The use of acupuncture instead of anaesthesia during surgery only started in the 1950s. It was this that helped to convince some doctors outside China that there was more to acupuncture than mind over matter.
In China today, acupuncture is used during all sorts of operations, from tonsillectomies to caesareans, and is even used in open heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation or with drugs. It's claimed that the pain is more or less eliminated, but it varies from person to person. It's hard to imagine many of us finding the option of lying awake on the operating table very attractive. But acupuncturists say that acupuncture anaesthesia involves none of the side-effects of conventional anaesthetics (e.g. nausea), and you recover from it more quickly.

F. Always effective

As with most complementary therapies, clinical trials to evaluate acupuncture are difficult to run. But trials that have been done have shown that 50 to 80 per cent of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it won't work for everyone and that people vary in their responsiveness.
Traditional acupuncturists say that for chronic long-term pain it will usually take between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief. But some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.

G. A different approach to pain

But Western and Chinese medicine view pain rather differently. Like most alternative therapists, an acupuncturist views his or her patient in a holistic way. This means not just focusing on specific symptoms. An acupuncturist spends a long time making a diagnosis, trying to find underlying weaknesses in the Oi. He or she will also want to know what external factors are causing the pain. For instance, is the pain worse in the cold, heat, damp or wind? Does it feel sharp, dull, throbbing, constant or burning? These are seen as important factors in deciding how acupuncture can be used to treat the pain. It's unlikely that your average medical doctor would take such things into account, isn't it?

H. Traditional or not?

Some medical professionals do have traditional acupuncture training. Others - including many GPs who practise acupuncture reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations.
But many traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine is it possible to bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure - something that is very difficult to assess in trials.

EVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world, where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? How do they get away with it? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try, a century after Darwin's death, to settle the matter.
Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. That is, in a crowded and hence competitive world, the individuals best suited to the circumstances - the 'fittest' - are the most likely to survive and have offspring.
But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance, and Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection'. The driving mechanism was simply that females liked -- in his words - 'beauty for beauty's sake'.
But Darwin's friend and collaborator, Alfred Russel Wallace, though in many ways more 'romantic' than Darwin, was in others even more Darwinian. 'Beauty for beauty's sake' he wanted nothing of. If peahens chose cocks with the showiest trains, he felt, then it must be that they knew what they were about. The cocks must have some other quality, which was not necessarily obvious to the human observer, but which the hens themselves could appreciate. According to Wallace, then, the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.
Now, 100 years later, the wrangle is still unresolved, for the natural behaviour of peafowl is much harder to study than might be imagined. But 200
birds at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds yet are used to human beings, offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues at
Whipsnade have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
In practice, the mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.
But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down. William Hamilton of Oxford University has put forward the hypothesis that showy male birds in general, of whatever species, are the most parasite-free, and that their plumage advertises their disease-free state. There is evidence that this is so in other birds. But Dr Petrie and her colleagues have not been able to assess the internal parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks to test this hypothesis. This year, however, she is comparing the offspring of cocks that have in the past proved attractive to hens with the offspring of cocks that hens find unattractive. Do the children of the attractive cocks grow faster? Are they more healthy? If so, then the females' choice will be seen to be utilitarian after all, just as Wallace predicted. 
There is a final twist to this continuing story. The great mathematician and biologist R A Fisher in the thirties proposed what has become known as 'Fisher's Runaway'. Just suppose, for example, that for whatever reason - perhaps for a sound 'Wallacian' reason a female first picks a male with a slightly better tail than the rest. The sons of that mating will inherit their father's tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This is how the runaway begins. Within each generation, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring, and the females predilection for long tails will increase commensurately. Modern computer models show that such a feedback mechanism would alone be enough to produce a peacocks tail.

89,56,"We changed lives for a day!

Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex.

A. Amanda's story

I'd never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I'd survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else!
I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first!
By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I'd remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated.
After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say 'Pardon?', which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a 'quiet' day!
I never realised how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shrinking violets, but in fact you definitely need to be quite bubbly, as well having the ability to keep a cool head and deal with what is known in the trade as a 'high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers!
I'm really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets chaotically busy. I wasn't too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a lousy waitress because even the rich Americans didn't tip me a bean!
I must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing!

B. Cindy's story

I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a 'mum' for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I'd been warned the girls were cheeky, but in my ignorance I thought I could handle it. Little did I know!
As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery I thought I'd have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house and do the washing.
At 1 pm I picked up Katie, whizzed around the supermarket and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could! I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they'd soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realised it was just a ploy so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating deals with them.
I never realised how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.

Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school.

C. Rosemary's story

On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I dithered for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I?
Looking at a sea of faces -- about 400 pupils -- at assembly, I hoped I melted into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm.
After that it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails.
By lunchtime I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There's so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials.
Alter lunch there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which really showed up my rusty French.
Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I'll stick to farming, anyway!

D. Hilary's story

I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she manufactures ice-cream, yoghurt and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to he checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!
Alter feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!
I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year.
Farming seems romantic but the reality is very different.

90,66,"A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few surviving collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculpture in the world, comprising over six hundred works. The first thing to remember about the collection is that nothing here is genuine. All the sculptures are accurate replicas cast from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is housed in a purpose-built gallery with excellent natural light. The advantages of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures originally set up together but now split between various museums all over Europe can be viewed together as originally intended. Nearly all the most celebrated works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in one afternoon.

B. Cambridge Darkroom

Cambridge Darkroom is a centre for photography with community darkrooms and a gallery showing a varied exhibition of photography and related media. We regularly run courses and workshops for people of all ages and abilities, including our popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course and Master Classes with invited photographers. We have a membership scheme whereby all our members can use our darkrooms. We also encourage young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to develop their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We stock photographic books and an magazines and carry a full range of photographic materials.

C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology

The Sedgwick Museum houses a magnificent collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks and minerals of all geological ages, and from all parts of the world. It also houses Britain's oldest intact geological collection, that of Dr John Woodward (1665-1728). It includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original early 18th century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was Professor of Geology and keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his long life, he added enormously to the collections, laying the foundations of a truly outstanding museum. The collection is arranged by geological age so that the major changes in life on Earth can be traced through time.
The new Whewell Gallery houses the beautiful minerals and gems of the collection. The displays are accompanied by full explanatory labels to explain both their nature and modern use.

D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs

There are over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs in the collection, taken by members of the university's staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and undertakes photographic work throughout Great Britain. The photographs are of considerable general interest as a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the effects of human activity from prehistoric times to the present day. There is a small display in the entrance hall and the knowledgeable library staff will be happy to deal with canicular enquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed but copies can normally be purchased. These are made to order and ordinarily take about a month.

E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre

Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre, the second oldest and longest surviving centre in the world, is one of the regions most unusual tourist attractions. Hours of enjoyment are to be had creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates off tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By formulating resin copies, known as facsimiles, the centre has made it possible to preserve the originals and still make brass rubbing an accessible pastime to all. The brass plates, as an alternative means of memorial to the tomb statue, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Through various revolutions most of the beautiful brasses were destroyed.

The study of handwriting to reveal a person's character is gaining support

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting, as much as anything else, that would determine your suitability for the job.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions.
She says: 'Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.'
According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: 'Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

The person behind the handwriting: examples analysed by graphologist Patricia Marne. 'I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.'

'Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.'
Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. 'You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.'
A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.
Ms Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form 'threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the 'i' are a bid for attention, and crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronising attitude.
Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.
This will happen soon, she believes. 'It's actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.'
Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them.

A.
The career of citizen Tristan Smith, set in the fictional republic of Efica, is an extraordinary parable of human power, history and humour. In a feat of considerable literary skill, the author has created a world with its own history, traditions and customs.
The book is notable also for its humour, and for the author's unique vision, which is here combined with his penetrating psychological insight in a novel which is difficult but rewarding.

B. 
Harriet is poised and middle-class, with an architect husband and her own business. 
Ordinarily, she would never have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who looks after her ageing father and has brought up her grandson, Leo, since he was three.
Their lives are shattered when the teenage Leo viciously attacks Harriets son, Joe, in the street. After the court case both boys refuse to talk about what happened. Leo, who had been a model pupil and had never been involved in a fight before, will not explain what came over him, while Joe recovers physically but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is tortured by the effect on her son and ministering to him takes over her life. Sheila is so wracked with guilt that she requests a meeting - from which their unusual friendship grows.
The great strength of the author has always been in depicting how people react to upheaval in their lives. He also captures the mothers sense that, no matter how hard she tries, she can never do enough.

C.
Shortlisted for the Booker prize, this book follows the fortunes of one of the most isolated of the Scottish Orkney islands and its inhabitants over a long and uneventful rural history.
The book sets this narrative against pertinent moments in Scottish history, as vividly imagined in the daydreams of the young protagonist, Throfinn
Ragnarson, who disappears abruptly at one point in the book, only to return after the Second World War, having now learnt to appreciate the simplicity of his worthy ancestors lives.

D.
Following his recent blockbuster success, the author has produced a sequel resonant with the same gentle irony and acid observations of family life which made its predecessor so appealing.
Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her spirited companion, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life remains the same winning combination of vanity, charm and reluctant kindness, and Rosie provides an ally in her continuing and highly enjoyable manipulation of both suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora is forced to acknowledge the passage of time that brings a new generation to centre stage.
The author is skilful at exposing the haunting sadness that hovers beneath the seeming ordinariness of life. He is attuned more to the shadows than the bright lights of human activity and identifies the randomness of events.

E.
Six disparate people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the islands of the South Pacific in his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. With her awe-inspiring mastery of descriptive language, the author charts the personal voyages of self-discovery with which each of these mariners prepares to return home, their own spirits quickened and made ardent by the experience of life adrift on 'the desert cities of waves'.
The author uses startling images to convey her themes of memory and awareness.

Four academic writers discuss the topic of international voluntary work. 
 
A.
It is hard to argue that the actual contribution to development amounts to a great deal directly. Whilst volunteer tourists can get involved in building homes or schools, they have usually paid a significant fee for the opportunity to be involved in this work: money that, if donated to a local community directly, could potentially pay for a greater amount of labour than the individual volunteer could ever hope to provide. This is especially so in the case of gap years, in which the level of technical skill or professional experience required of volunteers is negligible. Hence, it is unsurprising that many academic studies allude to the moral issue of whether gap year volunteering is principally motivated by altruism - a desire to benefit the society visited - or whether young people aim to generate 'cultural capital' which benefits them in their careers. However, the projects may play a role in developing people who will, in the course of their careers and lives, act ethically in favour of those less well-off. 

B.
Volunteering may lead to greater international understanding; enhanced ability to solve conflicts; widespread and democratic participation in global affairs through global civic society organisations; and growth of international social networks among ordinary people. In this scenario, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an outcome where benefits accrue to volunteers and host communities, and contribute to the global greater good. However, if volunteering is largely limited to individuals of means from wealthier areas of the world, it may give these privileged volunteers an international perspective, and a career boost, but it will do little for people and communities who currently lack access to international voluntary work. Those who volunteer will continue to reap its benefits, using host organisations and host communities as a rung on the ladder of personal advancement. 

C.
At its worst, international volunteering can be imperialist, paternalistic charity, volunteer tourism, or a self-serving quest for career and personal development on the part of well-off Westerners. Or it can be straightforward provision of technical assistance for international development. At its best, international volunteering brings benefits (and costs) to individual volunteers and the organisations within which they work, at the same time as providing the space for an exchange of technical skills, knowledge, and cross-cultural experience in developing communities. Most significantly, volunteering can raise awareness of, and a lifelong commitment to combating, existing unequal power relations and deep-seated causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development. 
 
 
D.
Volunteer tourism seems to fit well with the growth of life strategies to help others. Such limited strategies, aimed at a humble 'making a difference', can appear positive and attractive in an anti-political climate. The personal element appears positive - it bypasses big government and eschews big business. Yet it also bypasses the democratic imperative of representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, most often ones that seek to work around rather than transform the situations of poor, rural societies. Cynicism at the act of volunteering is certainly misplaced. The act of volunteer tourism may involve only simple, commendable charity. However, where volunteer tourism is talked up as sustainable development and the marketing of the gap-year companies merges into development thinking, this is symptomatic of a degradation of the discourse of development.

94,10,"Chewing gum culture

It's fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today's gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture.
This was not always the case, though. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree, a shrub found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Grecian women, especially, favoured mastic gum to clean their teeth and sweeten their breath.
American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees when the bark was cut. Lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States in the early 1800s making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree of the Central American rainforest.
Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew, and soon a whole industry was born based on this product.
Yet repeated attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed. As the chewing gum market has grown, synthetic alternatives have had to be developed.
Today the few remaining chicle gatherers, chicleros, eke out a meagre and dangerous living, trekking for miles to tap scattered sapodilla in near-100% humidity. Conditions are appalling: highly poisonous snakes lurk ready to pounce and insects abound.
Most alarming is the unpleasant little chicle fly that likes to lodge its eggs in the tappers ears and nose.
Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below.
Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a forest camp, where it is boiled until sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is no picnic either, with a monotonous and often deficient maize-based diet washed down by a local alcohol distilled from sugar cane.
Yet, punishing though this working environment is, the remaining chicleros fear for their livelihood.
Not so long ago, the United States alone imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year just 200 tonnes were tapped in the whole of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.
Meanwhile, the world's gum producers are finding ingenious ways of marketing their products. In addition to all the claims made for gum - it helps you relax, peps you up and eases tension (soldiers during both world wars were regularly supplied with gum) - gums greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay.
Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes this. Our saliva, which neutralises the acid and supplies minerals such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride, is the body's natural defence. Gum manufacturers say 20 minutes of chewing can increase your salivary flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavours. Glycerine and other vegetable oil products are now used to blend the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial - but some flavours still need natural assistance.

95,23,"In search of true north - and the man behind Halley's comet 
Dr Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, aims to retrace Sir Edmund Halley's quest to chart compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Astronomer Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is best known for the comet that bears his name. Yet one of his greatest accomplishments, in the eyes of his contemporaries, was to chart, using calculations made on his sea voyages on the warship Paramore, the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now known as 'declination', that is, the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without it, sailors were unable to correct their compasses. It was therefore impossible to deduce longitude precisely and navigate the oceans.
So it was that Halley, one of only two men in the land at that time paid to conduct scientific research, set sail for the Cape Verde Islands with the grand plan of charting declination in the North and South Atlantic. The trip was quickly aborted because of crew insubordination, but Halley returned to the seas a second time.
This voyage took him and his crew to Rio de Janeiro, down past South Georgia, up again to Newfoundland and back to England. From these travels Halley published, in 170I, a 'New and Correct Chart shewing the Variations of the Compasse in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More sophisticated successors to this primitive cartographic effort proved indispensable to seamen for more than a century, before a slow change in the terrestrial magnetic field rendered them inaccurate.
If all goes well, Halley's accomplishments will be celebrated once again. Dr Clark, himself a keen sailor, plans to commemorate the three-hundredth anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore.
PS70,000 will have to be raised before he embarks, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is providing support for his efforts to do this. Dr Clark became fascinated by Halley during a two-year posting to Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read biographies of the great scientist. 
'Halley led a remarkable life: Dr Clark says. 'He was not only a respected scientist but also led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer but also did research in geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the positions of the stars, and also found time for other interests.'
It was during this period that Halley developed a diving bell and also advised Sir Isaac Newton during his writing of Principia Mathematica, the foundation of classical physics. Recreating the voyage, Dr Clark says, will afford Halley the recognition he deserves. The projected expedition, which he has entitled 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific merit.
It will involve making the measurements that Halley made, but with far more precise instruments. These measurements need to be updated because the terrestrial magnetic field is slowly but constantly changing.
The data collected should help to refine the existing mathematical model of Earth's magnetic field, called the international geomagnetic reference field. 'It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. That's because you need to know true north to measure the direction,' says Dr Clark.
'On our expedition we can use global positioning satellites to determine that.' The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy have offered to supply instruments. By chance, a Danish satellite will be taking similar measurements over the globe.
Dr Clark hopes that his measurements will plug any gaps in its coverage of the Atlantic Ocean and, he points out, it is also useful to have ground-based measurements as a comparison. It is easy to forget just how significant Halley's Atlantic journey really was. It was the first dedicated scientific expedition on the seas and Halley became the first civilian who was appointed naval captain to pursue what many regarded as an obsession with declination. Does Dr Clark possess the credentials to make his parallel voyage a success?
As well as spending two years in Antarctica and working in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey, he has already sailed the 13,000 kilometres from Rio de Janeiro to England. He envisages that the expedition will be completed in four stages, with four different crews.
And does he share Halley's obsessive trait? 'I am prepared to give up my life for eight months to do this, so I suppose some people might think I'm obsessed.

96,10,"A lot of advice is available for college leavers heading for their first job. In this article we consider the move to a second job. We are not concerned with those looking for a second temporary position while hunting for a permanent job. Nor are we concerned with those leaving an unsatisfactory job within the first few weeks. Instead, we will be dealing with those of you taking a real step on the career ladder, choosing a job to fit in with your ambitions now that you have learnt your way around, acquired some skills and have some idea of where you want to go. 
What sort of job should you look for? Much depends on your long-term aim. You need to ask yourself whether you want to specialise in a particular field, work your way up to higher levels of responsibility or out of your current employment into a broader field. 
Whatever you decide, you should choose your second job very carefully. You should be aiming to stay in it for two to three years. 
This job will be studied very carefully when you send your letter of application for your next job. It should show evidence of serious [line 26: beginning] career planning. Most important, it should [line 26: end] extend you, develop you and give you increasing responsibility. Incidentally, if the travel bug is biting, now is the time to pack up and go. You can do temporary work for a while when you return, pick up where you left off and get the second job then. Future potential employers will be relieved to see [line 34: beginning] that you have got it out of your system, and [line 34: end] are not likely to go off again. 
Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was the perfect first job in that 'OK ... they were very supportive people. I was gently introduced to the work, learnt my way round an office and improved my word processing skills. However, there was no scope for advancement. One day I gave in my notice, bought an air ticket and travelled for a year.' 
Juliette now works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. 'In two and a half years I have become more able and my job has really grown,' she says. 'Right from the beginning my boss was very keen to develop me. My job title is the same as it was when I started but the duties have changed. From mainly typing and telephone work, I have progressed to doing most of the correspondence and budgets. I also have to deal with a variety of queries, coming from chairmen of large companies to people wanting to know how to start their own business.

Five celebrities tell Andrew Morgan their favourite memories of railway journeys.
A Andrea Thompson - Newsreader
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to get back there as often as I can. There's a local train from Cannes along the coast which crosses the border with Italy. It takes you past some of the most amazing seascapes.It never matters what the weather is like, or what time of the year it is, it is always enchanting. Out of the other window are some of the best back gardens and residences in the whole of France. You feel like someone peeping into the property of the rich and famous. The travellers themselves are always lively because there is an interesting mix of tourists and locals, all with different itineraries but all admirers of the breathtaking journey.
Raj Patel - Explorer
I have enjoyed so many rail journeys through the years, but if I had to pick a favourite it would be the Nile Valley Express, which runs across the desert of northern Sudan. The one misfortune in my youth, growing up in South Africa, was missing out on a family train journey from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park. I was regarded as being too young and troublesome and was sent off to an aunt. When I came to live in England as a teenager, I still hadn't travelled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I ever saw and its great glass dome filled me with wonder.
Betty Cooper - Novelist
I am indebted to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. It was on the train that my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was absolutely wonderful. Someone happened to mention that pink was good for the brain, and I've never stopped wearing the colour since. What I remember about the journey itself, however, is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile to Ll,!XOrI.t was, without a doubt, the perfect way to wind down after all the wedding preparations.
Martin Brown - Journalist
We were working on a series of articles based on a round-the-world trip and had to cross a dessert in an African country. There wasn't a road, so the only way we could continue our journey was to take what was affectionately known as the Desert Express. The timetable was unreliable - we were just given a day. We also heard that, in any case,the driver would often wait for days to depart if he knew there were people still on their way. When it appeared, there was a sudden charge of what seemed like hundreds of people climbing into and onto the carriages - people were even allowed to travel on the roof free. During the night, the train crossed some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It was like a dream, like travelling across the moon.
Arisu Mezuki - Actress
I imagine most people's favourite impressions of trains and railways are formed when they are young children, but that's not my case. I was brought up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains, let alone travelled on them. It wasn't until I was a teenager that trains began to dominate my life. I made a film which featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, disused stretch of the line which had been lovingly maintained by volunteers. That's where my passion for steam trains began. When we weren't filming, we took every opportunity to have a ride on the train, and, when I went back last year, it was as if time had stood still.

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean we can't stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.' 
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures; including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. 
The Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' 
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"". This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.'
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a SO-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. 
There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever before seen them.

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners.
This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says.
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now.
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always.

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire.
'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is such a tranquil, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly giving an animal a cuddle. Some of the members of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get pressurised. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning out cages or handling rats. I'm fascinated to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo so I'll stay put.'
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo.
'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave thme a green polo shirt instead to work in -which was just as well, as I got very dirty. As I stroked one of the elephants, I reckoned Mandie would probably be packing up clothes in the cupboard. By five o'clock, I stank but I'd had such a brilliant day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.'
Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, went on location with the television gardening programme Ground Force.
'I was extremely excited about meeting the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the programme presenter, was really nice. One of the things I liked was the chance to be in the fresh air. Depending on my shifts, I sometimes never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was great fun. I thought I was pretty strong but I felt weak compared with the rest of the team. My romantic vision of landscape gardening had not included physical hard work or meticulous planning. I was more an enthusiastic than effective gardener, so I don't plan to give up my other job.'
Charlie Dimmock, landscape gardener with the TV programme Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital.
'I made beds and handed out tablets. I expected to faint when I was doing some jobs, but I amazed myself by finding that it didn't bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt tremendously 'girlie' compared with my normal male environment. I feel my job is a real waste of time compared with nursing. My day at the hospital was not exactly pleasant but it left me with a great sense of satisfaction.'
Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent the day with the airline Ryanair as a member of the cabin crew.
'I changed into the uniform, and the moment I put it on I felt completely different- people suddenly look up to you. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety, what to do if someone had a heart attack-which I knew about from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me and I felt very self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn't sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to look after.'
Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with the airline Ryanair, spent the day as a personal trainer in a gym.
'I was dreading doing this swap as I don't do any exercise. I was amazed at how much attention you give to one person. In my job you meet 130 passengers four times a day. I was very surprised at lunch to see that some of the trainers didn't eat ultra-healthily, but they all drink lots of water. I wouldn't swap my job for this.

101,42,"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page. Yet very few call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. 
Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where, to quote the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy', she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. 
That the PCC did not launch an investigation itself is a scandal. It should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the famous actress, has held back from making a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC [line 25: beginning] take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks? [line 25: end]
To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by their rivals and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not be sympathetic and editors would have to refuse to publish such material. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. 
If the PCC decided to take on this role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage him or her to make a complaint? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless? In addition, celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up, and then be outraged to find it wasn't. Above all, the role itself is too enormous. How could the PCC realistically monitor the whole of the British press: national, regional and magazines? 
Then there is the embarrassment factor to consider. However seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they really want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect the majority simply want to put it behind them and get on with their lives. Of course, one or two may have other reasons for keeping quiet. A worse story may exist, that they have managed to keep from the press, and they realise that this may also become public knowledge if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. 
One British comedian also suffered at the hands of the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneak photographer during a family holiday. His reason for this was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', saying that they thought it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, they thought he had a sense of humour.

102,60,"A NEW LIFE

The Farmer
Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm.
'After 14 years in business, I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. But I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years when I was made redundant. It came out of the blue. I didn't get a particularly good pay-off but it was enough to set up the farm with. My break came when I got to know the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. Through supplying them, my reputation spread and now I also supply meat through mail order. I'm glad
I'm no longer stuck in the office but it's astonishing how little things have changed for me: the same 80- to 90-hour week and still selling a product.'
The Painter
Ron Able white was a manager in advertising but now makes a living as an artist.
'My painting began as a hobby but I realised I was getting far more excitement out of it than out of working. The decision to take redundancy and to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I talked to was very helpful. I think I was the first person who had ever told him, ""I don't want to go back to where I've been."" He was astonished because the majority of people in their mid-forties need to get back to work immediately- they need the money. But we had married young and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We went to the north of England, where we didn't know a soul. It meant leaving all our friends, but we've been lucky in that our friendships have survived the distance - plenty of them come up and visit us now.'
The Haymaker
After working for five years asa company lawyer, Katherine Goodison set up her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients.
'My job as a lawyer was fun. It was stimulating and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realised I didn't want to become a senior partner in the company, working more and more hours, so I left. A lot of people said I'd get bored, but that has never happened. The secret is to have deadlines. Since it's a fashion-related business,you have the collections, next year's shapes,the season-there's always too much to do, so you have to run a very regimented diary. I feel happier now, and definitely less stressed. There are things I really long for, though, like the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I'm totally responsible for the product. If I do a rubbish job, then I'm the one who takes the blame. Of course, you care when you're working for a company, but when your name is all over the promotional material, you care that little bit more.'
The Masseur
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London.
'I had been in financial markets from the age of 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but I never found the work rewarding. I was nearly made redundant in 1989, but I escaped by resigning and travelling for a year. I spent that year trying to work out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the world's best gymnasiums and talked to the owners about how they started up. I knew that to change career I had to get qualifications so I did various courses in massage.Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I never used to feel in control, but now I have peace of mind and control of my destiny.

103,36,"Where I get my energy

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. 

A. Jeanette Kupfermann

Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning, I get tremendous energy. Anything to do with rhythm gives me energy, too - at the moment I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive and energising. I think you can feel drained if you're bored, maybe feeling life is pointless. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' 

B. Linda Kelsey

Magazine editor: 'I have so much work to do but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. I need a fair bit of sleep so when I do get it I feel really good. When I'm 
running at six hours' sleep a night, I feel a bit wet. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's finding the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and I try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've done exercise, my spirits rise amazingly. I get very low patches in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's probably good to eat something then.' 

C. Annie Nightingale

Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, grab the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You've got to achieve things and set yourself various goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my line of business there are lots of lively young people and you can't help being affected by that. I love tearing around the place on jobs, having a mad life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photographs but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them processed and can't wait to get them back. 
I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and it's a good release for my mind when I'm doing a lot of travelling.' 

D. Floella Benjamin

Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family and I think that being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give out so much and have an inbuilt resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered off by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill you get when they smile back. It's far better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' 

E. Deborah Moggach

Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything in the world is making a garden out of complete wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I smashed up all the concrete and dug in loads of soil. It was far better than any amount of workouts or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that somebody wants to read what I'm writing - I find it difficult to write in a void. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private property,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.' 

F. Katherine Monblot

Therapist: 'I believe you must have an interest in and respect for what you do in life. I like to take risks and I get bored quickly, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don't want to do wears you out. I used to be a member of various committees and resented the demands they made on my time.

104,29,"Studio Audiences 

What's it like to be in the audience when a television programme is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. 

Like technical difficulties,studio audiences are just another common feature of television life,and yet to many of us they remain a mystery. Watching them getting excited on game shows, for example, we sit back and ask ourselves - just who are these people? 
Of all the audiences for live entertainment, the studio variety is widely considered to be the lowest of the low. I have heard it said that even people who work in television treat studio audiences with scorn - or, as one cameraman put it,'like cattle'. 
I had assumed that studio audiences were made up of silly people desperate for two seconds of fame. But there's no such thing as a typical studio audience. They come from all classes, professions and income groups. Television tries to attract different types of people for different types of programme. 
Those of us who prefer to watch television from home can't see why anyone would want to watch television from a studio. Why would anyone bother to apply for tickets, travel long distances, and suffer hours of boredom in the discomfort of a studio just to watch what they can see at home? 
One theory is that people hope that for a second they might appear on television. I didn't believe this until I spoke to Angela: 'Why had she come?' It was a chance to appear on television.' Another theory is that people are curious to take a look behind the scenes. But the most common explanation I heard was simply a case of 'a friend gave me a ticket'. 
Few of us have ever sat in a studio audience, yet we think we can imagine what it is like. You sit there, squashed among strangers, while someone flashes cards with APPLAUD or LAUGH on them - and you clap or laugh accordingly. This may reflect the reality of some television, but not all by any means. As one studio manager puts it, 'We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.' 
But is there any real difference between what you experience in a studio and what you see on your television at home? For Claire, sitting in a studio is 'more exciting', while Charlotte liked the feeling of involvement with live television. 'Last year I saw my favourite comedian. When you see him on television at home you miss out on a lot.' 
What I missed out on was the sight of live actors - from where I was sitting all I could see was the back of somebody's head. The opening scenes were shot so far from where I sat that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

On the very last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to catch the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. That airy, light, clean, polished feeling I generally got in the station had been lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage stuffed the benches, and swarms of college kids littered the floor with their bags.
A grey-haired man was walking around speaking to different strangers one by one. Well-off, you could tell: tanned skin, nice sweater, soft, beige car-coat. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I had been thinking I wouldn't mind talking to her myself. The man said, 'Would you by any chance be travelling to Philadelphia?'
'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?'
'No, New York, but I'll be ...'
'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and he moved toward the next bench.
Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to
Philadelphia?' When the woman told him, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say a thing, just marched on down the row to one of the matched-luggage couples. I straightened up from my pillar and drifted closer, looking toward the platform as if I had my mind on the train.
Well, I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't, of course.
No doubt, I struck him as unreliable. He just glanced quickly at me and then swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. By now he was looking seriously stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!'
She lowered her book. She was thirtyish, maybe thirty-five - older than I was, anyhow. A school- teacher sort. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Why, yes, I am.'
'Then could I ask you a favour?'
I stopped several feet away and frowned down at my left wrist. (Never mind that I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could sense how she went on guard. The man must have sensed it too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!'
They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples hauling their wheeled bags behind them like big pets on leashes. Next I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. So I put her on a train this morning, stopping for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife in a state. She hardly said ""hello"" to me. You see my daughter'd forgotten her passport. She'd telephoned home from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do next.'
The woman clucked sympathetically. I'd have kept quiet myself. Waited to find out where he was heading with this.
'So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get somebody here to carry up her passport.'
A likely story! Why didn't he go himself, if this was such an emergency?
'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked him.
'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.'
This seemed like a pretty poor excuse, if you want my honest opinion. Also, it exceeded the amount of bad luck that one family could expect. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded!

Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than PS150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up

107,16,"So you want to be an actor

If you tell someone that you want to make a career as an actor, you can be sure that within two minutes the word 'risky' will come up. And, of course, acting is a very risky career - let there be no mistake about that. The supply of actors is far greater than the demand for them. 
Once you choose to become an actor, many people who you thought were your closest friends will tell you you're crazy, though some may react quite differently. No two people will give you the same advice. But it is a very personal choice you are making, and only you can take responsibility for yourself and for realising your ambition. 
There are no easy ways of getting there - no written examinations to pass, and no absolute guarantee that when you have successfully completed your training you will automatically make your way in the profession. It's all a matter of luck plus talent. Yet there is a demand for new faces and new talent, and there is always the prospect of excitement, glamour and the occasional rich reward. 
I have frequently been asked to define this magical thing called talent, which everyone is looking out for. I believe it is best described as natural skill plus imagination - the latter being the most difficult quality to assess. And it has a lot to do with the person's courage and their belief in what they are doing and the way they are putting it across. 
Where does the desire to act come from? It is often very difficult to put into words your own reasons for wanting to act. Certainly, in the theatre the significant thing is that moment of contact between the actor on the stage and a particular audience. And making this brief contact is central to all acting, wherever it takes place - it is what drives all actors to act. 
If you ask actors how they have done well in the profession, the response will most likely be a shrug. They will not know. They will know certain things about themselves and aspects of their own technique and the techniques of others. But they will take nothing for granted, because they know that they are only as good as their current job, and that their fame may not continue. 
Disappointment is the greatest enemy of the actor. Last month you may have been out of work, selling clothes or waitressing. Suddenly you are asked to audition for a part, but however much you want the job, the truth is that it may be denied you. So actors tend not to talk about their chances. They come up with ways of protecting themselves against the stress of competing for a part and the possibility of rejection. 
Nobody likes being rejected. And remember that the possibility is there from the very first moment you start going in for parts professionally.

108,46,"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 

How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. 
The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a
sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians.
Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. 
What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment. They stress, however, that their main aim is to turn out 'rounded and well-balanced individuals'. 
There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.
In addition, while most former pupils at music school feel that they benefited enormously from the range of high-quality music teaching available, many express reservations about the wisdom of restricting the academic programme, which definitely takes second place to musical activities. Many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent, well able to deal with academic pressure, and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it may be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education. 
Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment; for instance, at a school with a first class music department, or else by combining a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience.

I don't like landscapes which are completely untamed. It's the human element which is important to me. It's the same when I travel abroad. Lovely villages with old temples attract me, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went away to school in England and on Saturdays I would cycle to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. Cycling was a release from school. I loved exploring the bleak hilltops, the sheltered valleys and old villages. Coming from Scotland myself, I found the landscape familiar yet different and I still go back there today. I used to describe my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, at which I subsequently made my name.

There is a miniature railway that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by amateurs. I always travel first class as it doesn't cost much more than the regular fare. The scenery is not spectacular. The train moves across Romney Marsh with its sheep, and alongside a canal. But there is one point on the journey that I always look forward to - when our miniature world takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers spy on people at random points in their day, making a cup of tea, doing the washing up, unfolding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It's the ordinariness of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields and sheep and a distant grey sea. That makes me look more closely, to search for something that opens my eyes.

The Hartland Peninsula is a remote and lovely coast. The beaches are hard to reach and scattered with rocks, so crowds are largely non-existent here. They attract a few brave surfers but most visitors prefer instead to reflect on the majesty of the sea. The coast, which faces the Atlantic, is notorious for shipwrecks. There are coast walks which you can combine with trips inland up beautiful damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns and wild flowers. We stay in modest self-catering accommodation with a family who have some property in the village of Southole.

My favourite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a landscape of wide-open moorland which is perfect for hiking. There are not many residents and not many visitors either. It's an unknown corner, empty and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I discovered the area by chance when I was a student, and since then I've made an annual visit, either alone, or with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he's growing up in an urban environment.

I purchased Glenthorne, my favourite house in Britain. It was a question of obtaining pure peace and reconnecting with my English roots and coming home. I grew up in what is now known as Sri Lanka, but at the age of twelve went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to cycle around the moors and village backstreets. We had a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway you'd never return.That place was Glenthorne. It's the place of my dreams.

Exercise is essential for mind, body and spirit. It's one of the best ways to maintain a perfect balance when all around you everything seems more and more unbalanced and the world becomes ever more fast and furious. 
Don't groan because this is yet another article about fitness. The reason why there are so many is that it is seriously good for you. There are plenty of reasons why you should exercise and very few - for most of us why you shouldn't. Exercise improves muscle tone and provides quick changes in body shape. It improves muscle power and promotes good posture - the way in which you hold your body when sitting or standing. It helps prevent those muscle imbalances which can lead to injuries. It provides quick improvement in specific problem areas such as thighs, stomach and upper arms. It improves the condition of the heart and lungs and blood circulation. 
Probably all these reasons have been thrown at you time and time again, so maybe you are bored by them and have switched off. All right then, this should make you sit up and take notice. Did you know that exercise helps to ease depression and tiredness, and that it helps to regulate sleep patterns? Also that exercise is instrumental in controlling stress? Not only this, but exercise can help to relieve certain medical conditions. 
By now you should be influenced a little by these arguments. If not, common sense alone should tell you that exercise is good for you. 
There are plenty of types of exercise you can do aerobics, calisthenics, jogging, working out with free weights, working on weight machines. There is one point you should note - training too hard and with too much weight may cause injury, so start slowly and carefully. If you're not sure, you should consult your doctor on what's good for you personally. 
No amount of exercise will improve your body shape if you don't have good posture. This practically determines how you look and feel. Not only is a stiff or sagging body unattractive, it also lacks energy and is more likely to suffer from minor health complaints. 
If your body tends to slouch, imagine that the top of your head is connected to a helium balloon, which is trying to pull you up into the sky. This will help you to lift the chest for fuller and easier breathing. At the same time, it lengthens the abdomen, making the body look much slimmer. If the chest is well balanced when you are standing, you can see your ankles. 
Stretching the muscles improves flexibility and ease of movement, and helps you to maintain correct posture and to prevent muscle tears and injuries caused by overuse. If done four or five times a week, it will guarantee a more flexible,fitter body. So stretching should play an important part in your exercise routine, which should be performed both slowly and precisely.

THE NATIONAL TRUST 

The National Trust is an organisation whose aim is to conserve the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to one of the wardens employed by the Trust to look after the beautiful areas it owns. 

Common sense. That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' 
Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. 
'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. 
Since he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' 
Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth. 
Conservation is one of the main aspects of Gareth's work, along with public entry to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills and so on.' 
Gareth is certainly keen on his job and despite never being off duty, he obviously enjoys every minute of his work, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just walk into the area, demand everything, then walk out again as if it's their absolute right. Having to be nice to those people gets on my nerves!'

In our fast world of phones, fax machines and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. 
Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. 
When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a 
week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. 
There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. 
Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice and she has stayed with us. 
My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer, when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. 
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends of their own in Texas, organised by my penfriend.

We always went to Ireland in June. Ever since the four of us began to go on holidays together we had spent the first fortnight of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It's a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who bought the house, the Malseeds, have had to add to the building, but everything has been done most discreetly.
It was Strafe who found Glencorn for us. He'd come across an advertisement in the days when the Malseeds still felt the need to advertise. 'How about this?' he said one evening and read out the details. We had gone away together the summer before, to a hotel that had been recommended by friends, but it hadn't been a success because the food was so appalling.
The four of us have been playing cards together for ages, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia and myself. They call me Milly, though strictly speaking my name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko picked up his nickname at school, Dekko Deacon sounding rather good, I suppose. He and Strafe were at school together, which must be why we call Strafe by his surname as the teachers used to. We're all about the same age and live quite close to the town where the Malseeds were before they decided to make the change from England to Ireland. Quite a coincidence, we always think.
'How ve1y nice,' Mrs Malseed said, smiling her welcome again this year. Some instinct seems to tell her when guests are about to arrive, for she's rarely not waiting in the large, low-ceilinged hall that always smells of flowers. 'Arthur, take the luggage up,' she commanded the old porter. 'Rose, Tulip, Lily and Geranium.' She referred to the names of the rooms reserved for us. Mrs Malseed herself painted flowers on the doors of the hotel instead of putting numbers. In winter, when no one much comes to Glencorn Lodge, she sees to little details like that; her husband sees to redecoration and repairs.
'Well, well, well,' Mr Malseed said, now entering the hall through the door that leads to the kitchen. 'A hundred thousand welcomes,' he greeted us in the Irish manner. He was smiling broadly with his dark brown eyes twinkling, making us think we were rather more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel the others thinking that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn, all was well. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. 'You look younger every year, all four of you,' she said, causing eve1yone in the hall to laugh again. Arthur led the way to the rooms, canying as much of our luggage as he could manage and returning for the remainder.
After dinner we played cards for a while but not going on for as long as we might because we were still quite tired after the journey. In the lounge there was a man on his own and a French couple. There had been other people at dinner, of course, because in June Glencorn Lodge is always full: from where we sat in the window we could see some of them strolling about the lawns, others taking the cliff path down to the seashore. In the morning we'd do the same: we'd walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee in the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon we'd drive somewhere.
I knew all that because over the years this kind of pattern had developed.

Style informs every part of our lives today from clothes to interior decoration and accessories. Jo Foley provides a taste of the trends for this year's followers of fashion.
Ned Ingham: Dress Designer
Ned Ingham makes dreamy, romantic wedding dresses. 'People would do well to avoid the traditional, rather stiff dresses and the 'frilly' look in favour of much simpler styles,' he explains. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a schoolboy. Then, at the age of 16, he enrolled at fashion school, where he gained the technical skills to cut and construct clothes. But you do not have to be a bride to own an Ingham dress: he also designs long, classic evening dresses, given a fresh touch by up-to-the-minute colours and fabrics. For the less adventurous, Ingham's designs include a classic summer navy-blue suit, the centrepiece of the Englishwoman's wardrobe for most of the 20th century. But in his hands, it looks as new as tomorrow.
Sally Quail: Jeweller
Although she once worked for an art dealer, Sally Quail has had no formal training in jewellery. It was only when she could not find an engagement ring she liked that she decided to design her own. The resulting enquiries encouraged her to set up as a designer in 1990. Now her pieces are sought out by many stars of stage and screen. Her signature style is large semi-precious stones set in gold to make magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings fashioned after those worn in the 18th century. However, she has recently begun to use the most precious stone of all - diamonds. 'It must reflect my age,' says 36- year-old Quail. 'I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond and that is when I began working with them.'
Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer
Just four years after setting up in the fiercely competitive fashion business, Lily Grimson, with only an introductory course in art and design behind her, has had two of her creations selected for a major design exhibition. Whatever the shape and form of her designs, they are never ignored. All of Grimson's fashion bags are handmade in the UK.
The Grimson handbag is not simply a container - the bags are full of glamour, whether fashioned from the finest calfskin or the heaviest silk. A combination of chic and care makes a Grimson bag something special.
Peter Little: Hairdresser
For over 20 years, Peter Little has taken his scissors to some of the world's top heads. Everyone who is anyone has had their hair styled by this man. 'Most women want real-looking hair and a style they can manage at home,' he says. So his approach is a novel one - to ensure that his clients never appear as if they have just walked out of a salon. But this carefree attitude and casual look does not come cheap - PS250 for the first appointment, and there's a three-month waiting list. Trading on his celebrity, Peter has produced his own range of hairdryers and other styling equipment. Now, those who can't make it to his salon can create their own styles back at home.
Penny Pratt: Florist
In addition to running her tiny shop, Penny Pratt is a flower consultant for a large chain of supermarkets and provides floral ideas to a number of top restaurants. All of this is good going for someone who has no floristry qualifications and gave up her job as a teacher 10 years ago in order to do 'something different'. And her simple, yet incredibly modern, creations have begun to capture every design prize in the flower business, which has helped her in setting up her own London Flower School. She has recently combined her skills on extremely successful lecture trips to Japan and the USA. She says, 'Flower arrangements are much simpler these days. Keep them simple but strong and don't have too many leaves - they are too large and architectural.

The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost PS250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8degC but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14degC and 25degC at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached.

116,17,"Running a business in the countryside 

Five women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside. 

A.
'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over PS200,000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small, and I wanted work I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I was married, so my husband suggested I set up a computer-aided design business. It needed a huge amount of money and things were difficult in the beginning. But I have been very careful, making sure that I told the bank manager if I was likely to overspend. Being in the house is a big saving, and I can carry on working in the evening if I want. It has remained a small business. We hardly ever deliver work - people from the area tend to collect it from us.' 

B.
'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greetings cards. 'I trained in art at university, and wanted to work in a museum. But when I married, we went to live in the countryside, where there wasn't that sort of work. So I decided to set up my own business and I produce a range of 50 greetings cards which I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The disadvantage of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business comes completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work down from London as I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to exchange ideas with other people any more, but generally there are more advantages than disadvantages.' 

C.
'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has seen good times and bad. 'I started my business eight years ago. Then this type of business was expanding, and in two years my turnover went from PS24,000 to PS80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to sack them because of the decline in the economy, which was painful because it is not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am right back almost to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes. I have to be prepared to cut my prices when it's necessary and to look at different opportunities.' 

D.
TESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty per cent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The disadvantage is that it requires discipline to shut the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience had been in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.' 

E.
MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of PS250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs. Then I started getting requests from friends and relatives, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago I rented a small building and everything is made there - we have a baker and assistant, and a professional cake-icer. I don't cook at all now, as I run the commercial side.

117,31,"Behind the dolphin's smile

People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. 

Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They are among the most intelligent animals we know, they are sensitive to human emotions, and they allow us to dream of wonderful freedom out in the wild seas. 
This love affair has been encouraged by TV. First there was Flipper, and now there's Darwin, the star of Seaquest. However, these happy portrayals hide the reality of life for dolphins in the polluted and overfished seas of the 
late twentieth century.
The population of North Sea harbour porpoises (one kind of dolphin) is estimated to have been reduced by up to 89,000. You may expect such popular animals to be protected by law and taken care of in special marine reserves. This is not the case, however, and the lack of plans to look after them may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our times. 
Forty different kinds of dolphins are recognised worldwide. In the waters of northern Europe, the greatest number of dolphins are the striped, the common, the bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two generally live far out in the open sea. They are normally seen only in small groups, flashing quickly past ships, and we know very little about them. 
The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises, on the other hand, were once a common sight near to European coasts. Bottlenoses are particularly social and used to be found on the Channel coast and in river mouths in Britain, including the Thames. Resident populations can nowadays be found only in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the skin injuries found on the few that still remain indicate that they are suffering from stress. 
The complicated habits of the dolphins make it difficult to decide on the exact reasons for this reduction in numbers. The overfishing which is dramatically reducing the world's fish stocks and which is threatening to destroy local fishing industries, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. 
They are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them. In many modern fishing methods, huge nets are left to float or are pulled at great speed through the sea. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have been washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks, ropes and cuts on their bodies show that the main cause of death was the fact that they had been caught by such nets. 
Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies. The females then produce milk that is rich in pesticides, thus passing the poison in a concentrated fashion on to their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin being poisoned and killed by its mother's milk. 
But perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is the one posed by human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet

118,40,"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain. 

Kendra Slowinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park. 'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 
'I'm too involved in what I'm doing - concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else. I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.' 'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. 
'I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them.' These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.' 
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the 
opening ceremony.
'As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.'
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra. 
'But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.'
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing. 
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra. 'As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.' 
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. 'So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned. '
Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event.

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean.
Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teach- ing, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots.'They are used to these conditions, which mean they can't stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. Adive can last for 16hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button.' The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. 'No one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.'
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but Ido it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"".' This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. 
The relief was incredible - we were still alive!'
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had 
studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD.

120,20,"The Collectors 

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and the reasons why so many people enjoy the same hobby.
 
I have always loved collecting and collectors and one in three adults indulges in this hobby. It is a world of passion, envy and enthusiasm and delight. However, if you enter this world, remember one thing: in the end, if you do not fall in love with an object, do not collect it. 
Since the beginning of time, people have had the urge to collect. When primitive man collected pebbles, he hung them around his neck. Attracted by their shapes and colour, these pebbles represented man's first attempts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the intervening centuries, nothing much has changed. Small boys and girls still collect stones and seashells just for the beauty of their forms and colours. 
I have been collecting all my life. Everything from flowers such as tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was of stones picked up in my parents' garden. Aged six I had the good fortune, although it did not seem so at the time, to be sent to a school in a remote part of England, a cold and windy place surrounded by hills. When my parents came to visit me they used to take me to the local museum, which was full of objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these objects. 
Surprisingly I am not alone in being interested in collecting objects. One in three adults indulges the same passion. The reasons why people collect has become a subject of great interest. The current thinking is that, for some individuals, it is the only aspect of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it's just something I enjoy doing.
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He owned a 'room of wonders'. This was a collection of natural and artificial curiosities. There were cups made from coconut shells, carved ivory beads and pieces of Oriental china. Another aristocrat, Catherine the Great of Russia, collected more than 4,000 paintings.
However, you do not have to be rich and powerful to start a collection. I have collected items as different as tulip bulbs and china cups, searching out examples of each type with incredible determination. I remember the day that I persuaded a fellow collector of tulips to part with one which I wanted to add to my collection. I planted it and watered it until one year it vanished - stolen by another collector. 
One collection that I made was of American rag dolls - 350 of them. I looked all over the USA for these dolls, searching out each variation in design with delight. This collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. Next morning, I stood inside the front hall and saw the remains of furniture and my collection. I am not certain which saddened me more!
It is, I suppose, the way that collections change hands that has always interested me. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king, a poet: it is this that gives value to the goods that are traded in the markets of the world. As small objects become a popular collector's item, so they begin to rise in price.

121,15,"Father and son start Gold Rush 

Terence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. 
After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. 
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. 
Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. They then set about digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to form a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. 
Now they are running short of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put PS50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' 
As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. 'It would encourage more people to come here if they are right,' said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, 'but if these two find gold I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.' 
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s, when thousands were employed in hundreds of mines dotted around the countryside. One of the last remaining mines at Clogau-St David's, which produced wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. 
Now, however, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens.

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is very good for business.
Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bushy-bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their modest home in Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA, and reliving their childhood. In front of them lies a wooden board covered in round plastic pieces. They are playing the ancient game of pichenotte, one which, they insist, is unlike any other.
Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer originally from Quebec, Canada, brought the game into the USA and introduced it to his family. It wasn't long before, on just about every weekend and holiday, the family were playing the game and, as Dave says, 'having the best time ever'. Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico. But Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he'd made out of old wooden food crates, was not forgotten and they continued to play regularly. If visitors dropped by they were often fascinated, for the game was completely unknown in southern USA.
One day, three years ago, Dave set up the ancient pichenotte board and, realising how cracked and battered it had become, decided to make a new one. This turned out to be a beauty. A relative noticed and wanted one. Then a friend wanted another. Curious as to how great the interest might be, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new game boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. 'People there started to watch,' says Dave, 'and say, ""No way I'm playing that silly game."" Then they'd sit down, and pretty soon you couldn't them up from the table!'
When people started asking about the origins of the game, Dave decided to do some research. The roots, he discovered, were probably in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. That was adapted into a game called 'squails' which was played in pubs in Britain and, a century ago, British people emigrating to Canada brought the game with them. Pichenotte is the name of the French-Canadian version of the game that developed in Quebec.
Pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people, is clearly a game of skill. Each competitor gets 12 pieces or 'pucks'. These are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using the middle or index finger of one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. Three concentric rings around the hole are worth 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Eight tiny posts present obstacles. The game usually lasts just two minutes.
When they saw how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made a couple more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money changed hands and the game's popularity grew. So much so that championships began to take place and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. With word spreading more widely, the boards began to sell as fast as the brothers could make them. Eventually, they decided to go into the pichenotte business full-time.
They set up a workshop in the garage of their house and started turning out boards. More than 450 have been produced to date. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighs 12kg and is lcm thick. As Norm explains, 'They're very durable, as they have to stand up to lots of wear.' They are available, at $595 each, from the brothers' website.
As yet, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to produce pichenotte celebrities. Nonetheless, the day is not far off when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes rather than a saw and piles of wood.

123,33,"Interview Tips

First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' 
As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's
what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.'
Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for
the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' 
Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs.

124,69,"THE SHELL ARTIST

At the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.

There are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list. For the moment though, he will stick to the skill that he has been delighted to perfect over the past ten years: making delicate and unusual objects out of shells.
'Tell me if I am boring you,' he says, as he leads me round his apartment showing me his work. There is a fine line between being a bore and being an enthusiast, but Cooke need not worry: he fits into the latter category, helped both by his charm and by the beauty of the things he makes.
He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. 'I shan't be at all bothered if people don't buy them because I have got so used to them, and to me they're adorable. I never meant to sell my work commercially. Some friends came to see me about five years ago and said, ""You must have an exhibition - people ought to see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery"".' The result was an exhibition in London, at which 70 per cent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the enormous prices the pieces command - around PS2,000 for the ornaments an empty space above the fireplace would seem a small sacrifice for Cooke to make.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at PS225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists that he has nothing to do with the prices and is cheerily open about their level: he claims there is nobody else in the world who produces work like his, and, as the gallery-owner told him, 'Well, you're going to stop one day and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.'
'I do wish, though,' says Cooke, 'that I'd taken this up a lot earlier, because then I would have been able to produce really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing the best I can now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started.' Still, the work that he has managed to produce is a long way from the common shell constructions that can be found in seaside shops. 'I have a miniature mind,' he says, and this has resulted in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.
Cooke has created his own method and uses materials as and when he finds them. He uses the cardboard sent back with laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker ('If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!') and washing-up liquid to wash the shells. 'I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,' he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, colour gradations and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.
Cooke's quest for beautiful, and especially tiny, shells has taken him further than his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines, to name but a few of the beaches where he has lain on his stomach and looked for beauties to bring home. He is insistent that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who write him letters accusing him of stripping the world's beaches. 'When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?'

125,21,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages. 
'Never again,' I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and, because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learnt to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep.
Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too [line 10: beginning] anti-social, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life line 10: end] is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. 
Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. 
We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organising our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money and music. 
The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name. It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the [line 29: beginning] station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. [line 29: end]
Only by actually seeing Europe, by watching the changing landscapes and seeing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles, can you really have an accurate picture of the continent in your mind. Everybody knows what is there, but it is meaningless until you view it yourself. This is what makes other people's holiday photos so boring. 
While the train trip won't allow you to discover anything new in the world sense, it is a valuable personal experience.

126,55,"Five-star luxury meets up-to-date technology

The five-star Merrion Hotel, which has just opened, is the result of considerable research into customer requirements and nearly two years' work converting four large eighteenth-century houses in Dublin. Creating a new hotel in this way has allowed the latest technology to be installed. This has been done for the benefit of staff and guests alike.
At the Merrion, General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know the guests by name. However, for details of his guests' preferences, he relies on the hotel's computer system. It can deal with return clients in the extra-special way that is appropriate to a five-star hotel.
Though the system cost PS250,000 to install, it will pay itself over time, according to MacCann. He praises its efficiency and talks enthusiastically of the facilities it offers.
For example, a guest who requests certain music CDs during a first stay will find those same CDs ready for him on a return visit. This is thanks to the guest-history facility which allows staff to key in any number of preferences.
Hotel guests the world over frequently complain about room temperature. Another hi-tech system controls this essential area of comfort. Guests have the opportunity to change the temperature themselves within three degrees either side of the normal l8degC but, in addition, each individual room can be adjusted by any amount between 14degC and 25degC at the front desk.
For guests, though, it is the other technology offered in their rooms which is most likely to find favour. This is particularly true for the business user, and MacCann estimates that up to sixty-five per cent of his business will come from this part of the market. To provide the best service for such needs, the hotel has taken the traditional business centre and put it into individual bedrooms. Each one has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that doubles as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing facility.
Technology changes so quickly these days that the hotel has had to try to forecast possible improvements. Extra cables have been laid to handle whatever scientific advances may occur. The televisions are rented rather than bought, so that they can be replaced with more up-to- date models at any time. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when necessary.
Despite the presence of all this very up-to-the-minute equipment in the rooms, MacCann says they have tried hard not to make guests feel threatened by technology. The one hundred and forty-five bedrooms, large and well-furnished, are both comfortable and welcoming. There are, of course, a swimming pool and gym, six conference rooms, two bars and two restaurants, and a beautiful garden at the heart of it all.
As at all luxury hotels, the food that is offered to guests must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud's Dublin restaurant already had two Michelin stars when he agreed to move his restaurant business to the Merrion. Being part of the hotel site has huge benefits, both for him and the hotel itself. He has been able to design a new kitchen and take it into the modern age. There are better parking facilities than at the previous address, too. From the hotel's side, they are able to offer a popular and successful place to eat, with no financial risks attached.

127,13,"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you'll probably find her revising for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 

'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. 
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. 
Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. 
The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. 
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become accustomed to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' 
As a busy model though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can ring at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modelling now, you never have time for us"".' 
Kira has the looks, ability and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession.

Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than PS150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up

Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching.
For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go. Who would stay in a one-horse town, the back of beyond, the end of the world, the sticks? That's all she had heard for years. They were all going to get out, escape, see some life, get some living in, have a real kind of existence, and some of the others in her class had gone as far as the towns of Ennis or Limerick, where an elder sister or an aunt would see them settled in. But out of Jo's year, none of them were going to Dublin. She was heading off on her own.
Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would come to no harm. Her father said that he hoped they kept the place warm; hostels were well known for being freezing. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel as waitresses, said she must be off her head to have stayed a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her and discussing her, as she answered the advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too dear!
There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't so much 'Flat to Let', more 'Third Girl Wanted'. The fact that it said 'own television' made Jo wonder whether it might be too high a class for her, but the house did not look in any way overpowering. An ordinary red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs. And a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and went on climbing.
'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' printed on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that toffee-nosed girl going out? I can't stand that kind, I can't stand them.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just poked around and pulled a face and sort of giggled and then said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her in here, would we, Pauline?'
Pauline had a psychedelic shirt on, so colourful it almost hurt the eyes, but even so it was only slightly brighter than her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with amazement. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I rang.' Nessa said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it.

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a come-what-may attitude to the garden, rather like an affectionate aunt who is quite happy for children to run about undisciplined as long as they don't do any serious damage.
With two forthcoming exhibitions to prepare for, and a ready supply of subject material at her back door, finding time to work in the garden has been difficult recently.

You're not happy in your job at the moment, but you don't know how to change? Kitty Doherty gives some good advice. 

 
The answer for more and more people who want to change their job is to turn to a careers adviser. You will be asked to write a brief history of yourself and then sit through a number of tests known as 'psychometrics'. A summary of the findings is then given and various careers are suggested, as well as the possible retraining needed. 
I decided to try out Career Analysts, one of the largest organisations giving career advice. Taking the careers test was like being back in my science exams. I was with a group of about ten people and we were answering questions against the clock. I had to remember that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometrics would give an accurate picture of me. They involved things like picking out mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching up similar shapes in a set. 
I then had a long chat with an adviser and from this, plus the results of the test, he produced a report giving his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of the adviser's conclusions, though I was a little dismayed to find out that I had done quite badly in the scientific, technical and practical tests. I am sure that a lot of sick people are glad that I never became a nurse. It was reassuring, though, to be told that I had made the correct decisions as far as journalism was concerned. 
Rethinking your career needn't involve a massive change of direction. Last March, after working as a marketing manager with a large insurance company for five years, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. 'Losing my job was the perfect opportunity for me to take a step back and look at my career to date. I wanted to re-examine the skills and interests I have,' says Donna. Some of the results were surprising. 'I hadn't realised that I had such a gift for design. But in the end I had to balance the cost of retraining in design against my financial commitments,' she says. Other suggestions were put forward, such as taking a year off and working in the Far East. 
'I decided to use the skills I already had and move into something more suited to me than insurance. I am now working as a Public Relations officer. I am sure I would have got to this point without Career Analysts but they helped me realise, objectively and independently, what I definitely wanted to do. I have sent half a dozen friends there, who are all happy with the service.' 
There are those who feel that they definitely would not have got to that point without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services led 26-year-old Juliet Greene to make some life-changing decisions. 'After working for a major bank for six years, I decided my job was dull and I needed a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I went to Career Counselling Services with a completely open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,' she says. 'I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was taped, which I found very useful, as you forget many of the things you say. After the fourth meeting, having listened carefully to what the results of the tests were telling me, I made the decision that I wanted to do geology and I plan to start a degree course in it later this year. I think that the advice given by Career Counselling Services was well worth the fee. I'm a lot happier now and far more positive.' 
However, careers advice doesn't work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says: 'I had reached a stage in my career where I didn't know where to go. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something I had never thought of. Although I was given a host of new ideas, I rejected them as they either required a substantial drop in salary or considerable retraining. I wasn't told anything about myself that I didn't know/ she says.

Many trees in the Brackham area were brought down in the terrible storms that March. The town itself lost two great lime trees from the former market square. The disappearance of such prominent features had altered the appearance of the town centre entirely, to the annoyance of its more conservative inhabitants.
Among the annoyed, under more normal circumstances, would have been Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, head of the local police force. But at the height of that week's storm, when the wind brought down even the mature walnut tree in his garden, Pelham had in fact been in no fit state to notice. A large and healthy man, he had for the first time in his life been seriously ill with an attack of bronchitis.
When he first complained of an aching head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, had tried to persuade him to go to the doctor. Convinced that the police force could not do without him, he had, as usual, ignored her and attempted to carry on working. Predictably, though he wouldn't have listened to anyone who tried to tell him so, this had the effect of fogging his memory and shortening his temper.
It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took the initiative and drove him to the doctor's door that he finally gave in. By that time, he didn't have the strength left to argue with her. In no time at all, she was taking him along to the chemist's to get his prescribed antibiotics and then home to his unsurprised wife who sent him straight to bed.
When Molly told him, on the Thursday morning, that the walnut tree had been brought down during the night, Pelham hadn't been able to take it in. On Thursday evening, he had asked weakly about damage to the house, groaned thankfully when he heard there was none, and pulled the sheets over his head.
It wasn't until Saturday, when the antibiotics took effect, his temperature dropped and he got up, that he realised with a shock that the loss of the walnut tree had made a permanent difference to the appearance of the living-room. The Pelhams' large house stood in a sizeable garden. It had not come cheap, but even so Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The leafy garden had created an impression of privacy. Now, though, the storm had changed his outlook.
Previously, the view from the living-room had featured the handsome walnut tree. This had not darkened the room because there was also a window on the opposite wall, but it had provided interesting patterns of light and shade that disguised the true state of the worn furniture that the family had brought with them from their previous house.
With the tree gone, the room seemed cruelly bright, its worn furnishings exposed in all their shabbiness. And the view from the window didn't bear looking at. The tall house next door, previously hidden by the tree, was now there, dominating the outlook with its unattractive purple bricks and external pipes. It seemed to have a great many upstairs windows, all of them watching the Pelhams' every movement.
'Doesn't it look terrible?' Pelham croaked to his wife.
But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more pleased than dismayed. 'That's what I've been telling you ever since we came here.

133,5,"Living in the valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.
It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills.
Soon snow began to fall. Within a day it lay some 15 centimetres deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there the wind blasted fiercely. Deep in our valley we felt only sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches held firm.
And yet we knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have occurred if circumstances had been different, if the flow of water from the hills had not, many years before, been controlled, held back by a series of dams.
In a short time the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched furious clouds pile up high over the hills to the west. Sinister grey clouds extended over the valleys. They twisted and turned, rising eastwards and upwards, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which every day was becoming fuller and wilder.
The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds, but high up in the hills the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. And then it happened - for the first time in years the reservoir overflowed. There in the heights it was like the Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. 
The river seemed maddened as the waters poured almost horizontally down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.
On many occasions through the centuries before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in just such a rage. Now, though, the dam restricts the flow of the river and usually all is well; the great mass of water from the hills, the product of snow and torrential rain, remains behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and can be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses.

134,3,"The Netball Captain

In our series on women in sport, Suzie Ellis went to meet England's netball captain.

Kendra Slawinski is captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she'd had a typical day for the weeks leading up to next month's World Championships: a day's teaching at a local school followed by a training session in the local supermarket car park.
I was surprised to hear about her training venue.
'Don't you get strange looks?' I asked her. 'I'm too involved in what I'm doing concentrating on my movements and my feet - to see anything else,' she said.'I might notice cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all.'
'My whole life now is all about making sure I'm at my absolute best for the Championships,' says Kendra. I'm on a strict timetable to gain maximum fitness for them. These are her fourth World Championships and they are guaranteed to be the biggest ever, with 27 nations taking part.
'We'll have home support behind us, which is so special,' she says. 'And it's important that the reputation of netball in this country should be improved. As a result of playing here, there will be more pressure than we're used to. A home crowd will have expectations and give more support. People will expect us to start the tournament with a good game.'
Their first game is against Barbados and it comes immediately after the opening ceremony. As far as I'm aware, we have always beaten them, but they'll be exciting to play. They have lots of ability.'
The England team are currently ranked fourth in the world. But, as Kendra points out, the World Championships will be tough. 'You have to push yourself to play each day, there's no rest between games as in a series. And you can still win an international series if you lose the first game. But the Championships are different because there's only one chance and you have to be ready to make the most of it.
In the fifteen years since she has been playing at top level, the sport has become harder, faster. On court, players are more aggressive. 'You don't do all that training not to come out a winner,' says Kendra.But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We're all friendlier after the game.' 
Netball is also taking a far more scientific approach to fitness testing.
'It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,' says Kendra.
As captain, I think it's important that I have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.'
'From the very beginning, my netball career has always been carefully planned,' she says. So I took the decision some time ago that this competition would be the end of it as far as playing is concerned.
Doubtless she will coach young players in the future, but at the moment her eyes are firmly set on her last big event. As she leads out her team in the opening candlelight ceremony, she is more than likely to have a tear in her eye.

135,65,"Miss Rita Cohen, a tiny, pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be some six years older, came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes, and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was so tiny, so young that he could barely believe that she was at the University of Pennsylvania, doing research into the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
Three or four times a year someone either phoned Seymour or wrote to him to ask permission to see his factory, and occasionally he would assist a student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as especially serious, by offering a brief tour.
Rita Cohen was nearly as small, he thought, as the children from Marie's third-year class, who'd been brought the 50 kilometres from their rural schoolhouse one day, all those years ago, so that Marie's daddy could show them how he made gloves, show them especially Marie's favourite spot, the laying-off table, where, at the end of the process, the men shaped and pressed each and every glove by pulling it carefully down over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were dangerously hot and they were shiny and they stuck straight up from the table in a row, thin-looking, like hands that had been flattened. As a little girl, Marie was captivated by their strangeness and called them the 'pancake hands'.
He heard Rita asking, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes as she asked, 'They come direct to your shipping department?'
He liked finding that she was interested in eve1y last detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material and they make it into the right kind of weather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery right here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started working in the business. Ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you've got to go to a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I'll set that up for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. The technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't that different from what you'd have seen hundreds of years ago. Awful work. It's said to be the oldest industry of which remains have been found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old relics of tanning found somewhere Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins that were tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather scholar; he's the one you should be talking to. Start my father off about gloves and he'll talk for two days. That's typical, by the way: glovemen love the trade and everything about it. Tell me, have you ever seen anything being manufactured, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'Saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.'
He laughed. She had made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was easily 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but othenwise Rita Cohen had begun to remind him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that would just waft out of her and into the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly taken down in her notebook and memorised overnight.
'I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to bring you right through the whole process. Come on.

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. 

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. 
Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' 
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. 
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. 
Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' 
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. 
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' 
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff.

137,56,"Film Critic

Mark Adams looks back over the last ten years of his work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page.
Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing - novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff.
At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialised knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable.
It all felt like a bit of a dream at that time: a new newspaper, and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. In fact, the first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, then turning to a page on which one of my reviews appeared, I didn't know where to look.
Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film.
The luxury of this way of working suits me well. I wouldn't have been interested in the more standard film critic's role, which involves considering every film that comes out. That's a routine that would make me stale in no time at all. I would soon be sinking into my seat on a Monday morning with the sigh, 'What insulting rubbish must I sit through now?' - a style of sigh that can often be heard in screening rooms around the world.
The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument - or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. There is also such a thing as loyalty to 'type' or its opposite. It can only rarely happen that someone who hates westerns buys a ticket for one after reading a review, or a love story addict avoids a romantic film because of what the papers say.
So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument.

138,32,"HAPPY HUNTING GROUND 

We're 'animal people' who enjoy the company of all kinds of creatures. Consider this typical chain of events, leading to total confusion, which began one afternoon. My daughter telephoned me at work with the news that she had found a wonderful pine snake. 
'Can we keep him?' she cried. I said 'Yes, but only overnight.' We had set up a special tank for just such passers-through, overnight being long enough to admire and look them up in our well-used natural history book. 
I was late getting home. I hurriedly put a pot on to boil just as screams of 'Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!' came from my sons' bedroom. I leapt to it. 
The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse given to me as a Mother's Day present. (I've [line 23: beginning] heard that some mothers get [line 23: end] perfume.) Domino, with mouse feet waving from his jaws, ran round and round the bedroom that was crowded with furniture and children. 
Looking for a way out so he could enjoy his catch, Domino had so far avoided the forest of waving arms. I threw myself into the confusion and promptly tripped over something or someone to find myself on the floor. 
As I thought about dropping my full weight on Domino when he next came past, my eyes locked on the snake. It had escaped - or, more correctly, was escaping. It was pouring itself up and out and off the table and all over the floor. I crouched like a rabbit at the approach of its bullish head, and long powerful body. 
The snake and I were now both being jumped over by cat/mouse/kids in a screaming, leaping, hissing mass - the snake striking at every moment, the dog barking wildly. 
The pot boiled over in the kitchen and I raced to shut off the gas, returning to the battle with new strength. This time I successfully captured Domino by the tail, and pulled the small, damp and miraculously uninjured mouse from his growling jaws. Incidentally, the same mouse was caught by the same cat three more times during its lifetime, but eventually died of old age. 
[line 60: beginning] Encouraged by my success with the [line 60: end] cat, I looked the snake over for weak points. It didn't have any. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking backwards and forwards, but without a flute. Gradually the snake relaxed enough to drop its head on to its piled-up body, but its eyes still shone with suspicion. I eventually ever-so-slowly eased my hands beneath the piled-up snake and gradually raised myself to a kneeling position, then I stood up and walked to the very end of the garden where I gave the snake the choice of living happily ever after on the garden shed by pointing it in the direction of a handy tree. 
But when I finally gathered enough courage to release the snake's head - fully expecting it to swing instantly around to crush my face in its powerful jaws - it slid away from the tree and up over my shoulders where, like a colourful leathery shawl, it gave every sign of making itself comfortable for the winter. 
We stood in the gathering dusk, four young children, Mum and the snake. DJ, my eldest, broke the heavy silence with a scientific explanation: 'You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and fat and warm, and the shed isn't.' I had the children gather at the snake's tail end and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly and unwillingly it did so. Without a backward glance, the snake travelled smoothly up the wall to disappear over the now night-shadowed roof.

If there's one thing guaranteed to send tears running down your cheeks, it's the sight of a brilliant child collecting a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars, and their mothers, to describe some of the pleasures and pains of their lives. 

A. 
Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. Her ambitions are to become a physiotherapist and compete at the next Olympics. 'The work is very hard at the moment. There is no time to watch television, or go out with friends or do much more than gym and school. I try to take the training day by day, and when I feel very, very tired sometimes my coach gives me a day off, but usually I just carry on - you can't take too many days off, it makes you stiff.' 

B.
Annika's mother

'From an early age Annika showed tremendous potential. I've seen some parents try to push their children and it doesn't work. To perform at the level Annika does is so demanding of time and energy you have to want to do it yourself. People tell me all the time that we, as parents, have given up so much, but what they don't see is what the sport's given us. We love it and what it's done for Annika. Before she did gym she was a very shy little girl who sucked her thumb and hid behind me, but now she's met people from all over the world and she's got the confidence of success.' 

C. 
Sarah Stokes made her first show-jumping appearance at ten. Since then 
she has won the British National Championship. 'It's a good job my mum and dad like show-jumping because they train me and have to take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows are from one day to five days long. I don't ever get tired of it - I love show-jumping events, they are exciting and fun. Even if I didn't have Mum and Dad, I would do it because I am so determined. I'm 
glad they are happy when I win, but I'm not doing it for them. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My really big ambition is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.' 

D. Sarah's mother

'From the moment Sarah sat on a horse, age 1, that was it, her passion. When she was 5, she used to get up before us all to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows you have to jump all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is well organised. She is 100% happy on a horse, she knows what she's doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is hard to beat.' 

E. Jane McShane, 10, is Britain's Under-14 Chess Champion. 'It's really friendly at tournaments. I know everybody and it's fun. When I'm playing, I don't concentrate. I should do really, but instead I just stare around and don't bother to think. I'm not scared of getting big-headed, I don't talk about my success at school. I don't like embarrassment.' 

F. Jane's mother

'Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, ""Let's see if she likes it."" My father had tried to teach me when I was young and I used to sit there bored, but Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that afternoon she had memorised all the moves, and by 6 was starting to beat adults. When she's won of course I'm pleased, but if she said she wanted to give it all up tomorrow, I wouldn't stand in her way.

140,6,"Confident people what's their secret?

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A Jenny

When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.
There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela

It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself.
If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears!

C Lisa

People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.
I also think you gain confidence by tackling things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was so nervous, but I passed. After that I felt sure that I'd never feel so frightened again, and I never have.

D Barbara

My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round. I work hard and I'm popular in the restaurant, but it's probable that one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that affect me. You've got to like yourself for what you are, not try to be what others expect.
My company runs a lot of training courses, and going on those has built up my self-esteem. The company also encourages employees to set manageable targets. It helps no end if you can see you're achieving something tangible, rather than reaching for the stars all at once, and ending up with nothing but air!

E Kim

After I left college I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point. Even so, when I first worked in politics, I'd never spoken in public before and always used to shake like a leaf. I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!
I don't think there is anyone who isn't a little shaky when it comes to talking publicly.

141,45,"My line of work

Four people talk about their jobs.
Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum
I'm responsible for putting temporary exhibitions together. This includes planning and designing the exhibition and promoting it. I have to read up about the subject of the exhibition beforehand and then talk to important people in the area so that I can establish the main themes and aims of the exhibition, and plan what objects and pictures should be displayed. I have to make sure the public can understand the thinking behind the exhibition, which means planning interactive displays, workshops and theatre. I also have to bring in engineers and electricians to make sure the final display is not dangerous to visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write the brochures and leaflets that we'll use to tell people about it.

Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers
The first thing I do when I get here at 7.30 a.m. is check the accounts. Then I see what new maps and documents need to be produced in order to learn the 'runs' or routes necessary to pass the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, working out how to make the journeys. They work out the most direct route, using the correct one-way streets, and right- and left- hand turns. I get involved when there's a difference of opinion - like whether you can do a right turn at a particular junction. When they're close to the test, I'll give them a simple route and no matter what way they say they'll go, I'll tell them they have to use another route because the road is closed. The next student will have to find a third route and again I'll come up with a reason why they can't go that way. It's just to make them think.

Sarah - Marine Conservationist
I live by the coast and work from home. This involves responding to telephone enquiries, producing educational resources and setting up training courses. Occasionally, I go into our main office but generally I am on the coast. I also work with schools and study centres and run courses for coastal managers and those involved in making decisions about the fate of the seas.I do things like take them out to sea in a boat in an attempt to make them think more about the life underneath them. This often changes their views as it's very different from making decisions using a computer screen. I am extremely lucky because conservation is my hobby, so the job has many highs for me. The downside of the job is that I work for a charity, so there is a constant need for more money. This means I'm always looking for more resources and I'm not able to achieve everything I want.

Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher
My work is pretty varied. I have to make sure that the publishing programme matches market requirements, and ensure that we keep stocks of 300 or so of the books that we publish. We have very high standards of information and content. We receive many letters from readers on issues such as the representation of international boundaries and these in particular require a careful response. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work as part of an enthusiastic group which makes the job that much more enjoyable. The negative side, as with many jobs, is that there is far too much administration to deal with, which leaves less time to work on the more interesting tasks such as product development and design.

142,61,"Fun at the Dentist's?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.'.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. 'We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. 'One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself', he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder.

If you are wondering where to send your story our expert Margaret Stubbs is here with the advice you need.
Readers of this magazine often write in saying, 'I have written this story / book. Can you please tell me who to send it to?' One of the first things they need to know is that they should be researching their markets and finding out about publishers as well as practising their writing skills. Turning words into a saleable commodity takes a good deal of knowledge about the 'writing game'.
Whatever kind of writing you do, you need to develop a knowledge of the markets you are aiming at. There are several ways of doing this, but the best one is simply by reading everything relevant you can lay your hands on. Use your local library and go round the local bookshops and newsagents. Reading widely will always give you the best guide to what kinds of writing publishers are actually accepting at any given time.
As time goes on, this knowledge must be updated as new publications are constantly appearing - editors change jobs, and magazines change direction. New titles are coming and going all the time. Publishers are always hungry for new blood; as writers we have to make sure we give them what they want.
To begin with you may be looking around, not quite sure what you want to write. Let us say you feel that you might like to write short love stories. The very first thing you must do is find out which magazines use love stories, a rather limited market these days, and get hold of as many recent copies as you can. Then familiarise yourself with the kind of stories they are buying, taking special note of who the readers are. These readers will expect different things from their magazine, and the editor is only interested in catering to their needs.
Writers often send me their stories saying, 'This has been rejected three times - please tell me if I am wasting my time ... do I stand a chance at all?' As a former teacher, I would never actively discourage anyone. But it is unlikely that the work is of publishable standard; so I have to try to give an honest opinion, but always with a positive viewpoint.
The problem is that most new writers are too eager to send their work out, usually long before they are ready to enter the market. If you have only written one story or one article, it is not at all likely to be published. That almost never happens. When you read about so-called success', you usually find that the person has been in the publishing trade or journalism for some years before their current success.
When you do finally send off some of your work for the first time, immediately get on with more work while you await a reply; write ten more stories, twenty even. Each one will be better than the last, and you will begin to think of yourself as a writer, and both your fluency and your confidence will grow. Don't tear any of them up-improve them instead. Also, I would advise not showing your work to anyone else, certainly in the early stages.
Don't forget that every successful writer will have had many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your career as a writer. See whether there's a creative writing course near you. If not, try joining a local writers' group which will help you to gain ideas and confidence from mixing with other aspiring writers.

144,33,"The Eden Project 

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular tourist attractions. At first sight, the huge 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like a scene from a science-fiction movie. 

Each biosphere contains a different climate zone, showing visitors just how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is amazing to see just how many products that we use every day come from plants: wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee and chocolate, for example. Over 135,000 different types of plant are grown here. However cold the weather is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. 
In the Rainforest Zone, the atmosphere is always damp because of a huge waterfall. Another zone reproduces the environment of the Mediterranean, California and South Africa, and there are plans to build a desert zone in the near future.

145,27,"SAMUEL PEPYS 

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time, like disease, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. 
He also writes about himself, even about his faults - he often slept during church or looked at the pretty girls. He describes his home life - a quarrel with his wife and how they became friends again, his worry about her illness.

146,58,"LITTLE CAT, LITTLE CAT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? 

When Bo the cat decided to explore a furniture van, she had a bigger adventure than she expected. She was discovered by the driver, after he had completed a trip of over 500 kilometres. It was the end of a long day. The driver and the cat were both hungry!He gave her some milk and started making enquiries. He telephoned his last customers, but they had not lost a cat. It was getting late, so he took Bo home for the night and next morning delivered her to an animal hospital. 
The cat's owner had done some detective work too. After searching everywhere for the cat, he suddenly remembered the furniture van which had made a delivery to a neighbour. Fortunately, he remembered the name of the company. He called their office and in a short time Bo was returned safely.

By Katie Atkins, aged 14 

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools - and our band won! 
Each band had their own costumes, ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore, to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn't look much like adult professional bands, but all of us were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially considering everyone was so young. Players from each band even created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch - but even better when my band played on stage! 
We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted - only about half, in fact. But anyone who's keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country - I've been to a couple and learnt a lot. 
Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it's because pop music isn't challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it's both new and old at the same time - you can create your own music, but you also feel you're part of its history, as you're playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you. 
My school's really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who've supported us all the way. Without them, we'd never get anywhere with our music!

149,55,"Climbing to the top of Britain

Each year thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland, and because of its northerly location, the climate can be bitterly cold. Climber Keith Hewitt describes his first time on Ben Nevis.

It was February, my first big winter climb. Our route was up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It's six hundred metres up - probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are like big bowls cut into the walls of the mountain half-way up.
We were carrying tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots -you'd have trouble on Ben Nevis without them because you get snow so hard it's like walking on ice. Even though some of the group were very experienced, we packed all kinds of safety equipment, including lights for attracting attention, hard hats and extra clothing. Although the weather forecast was perfect, with no strong winds, there was still a general feeling of nervousness when we set out. Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.
The track soon climbed and my legs felt heavy. Being the weakest member of the group, I had to rest more frequently. The others sometimes stopped for a break to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them they set off again. I promised myself that in future I would always train properly before a climb.
After 200 metre<;,we reached the beginning of Tower Ridge, the route that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It's only a metre and a half wide and the mountain drops away hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to keep calm and concentrate on every step as we moved slowly along it.
After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and right across it to the island of Skye, 48 kilometres away. However, we weren't so lucky, as a mist had come down.
On Ben Nevis, getting back down to camp can be as much of a challenge as going up. You need to be able to read a map properly a wrong turn could lead to slopes too dangerous to go down in winter. I was glad we had decided to take it in turns to do that job. That first time, it was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience.

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won,' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.'
The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learnt about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realised immediately that she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I had no idea what he meant. The only sport I knew about was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me training. It was such hard work and my legs really ached.' But Jose visited her parents and persuaded them she could be successful and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her away to train.
In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was unlike those of the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes but, while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were brilliant and I learnt a lot.'

Easter quiz for children
During the Easter holidays young visitors can take part in a quiz on the subject ofSurprises.The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be directed to 14 surprising paintings and asked a variety of questions about them.

New picture
The Gallery now has a fine still life by the Dutch 18th century painter Jan van Os. This large picture (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colours on wood. It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery. The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is not unusual for a picture like this to be dated in two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to bloom in their different seasons in order to paint them. This picture was generously given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.
Special exhibition
The exhibition 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period. Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition. These three artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez, and by two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.
Lecture news
The series of lectures arranged to go with the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, LizzieBarker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu.
On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often 'tell a story' through their pictures.

A report by Dave Worthington 

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for PS45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for PS30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop's normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn't close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: 'The police had been informed that a large crowd was expected but people just weren't patient. The shop was soon full and the managers sensibly decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and they refused to queue quietly until there was space for them inside. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What I really couldn't believe was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. This meant that the road was then completely blocked.' 
One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to get into the shop, said: 'I queued for three hours and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They didn't have any choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen but I'm not willing to queue again.'

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay PS280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.'
Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking!

154,5,"STAMP COLLECTING - IT'S A HOBBY THAT CAN GROW AND GROW

Millions of people of all ages enjoy a hobby which is both interesting and fun. And every year, more and more people start a stamp collection of their own and discover an interest which can last a lifetime. Starting your collection is easy because stamps are everywhere. Holiday postcards from friends, birthday cards from favourite aunts and letters from pen friends can all provide you with stamps from all over the world. But once you've started collecting seriously, you will probably want to join the Stamp Collectors' Club which exists to provide collectors with new British stamps.
As a Club member you order the special sets of new stamps you want for your collection. You can receive these in three different ways. We can either post you a complete set of stamps on an envelope addressed to you, or send you the same stamps in a colourful information pack with lots of interesting facts. Or, if you prefer, we can send you the individual stamps for you to arrange in a special book of your own.
The Stamp Collectors' Club has about 70,000 members and you could become a member too,with a two-year membership costing just PS5. You can even get a reduction if a group of you join at the same time. We're sure you'll agree that this is great value for money.
And when you join, the Club sends you a Starter Pack at no extra cost. This contains 100 stamps to begin your collection, together with an attractive box to keep them in. You also receive our helpful 4-page guide to collecting, which has further suggestions on how to add to your collection and includes useful addresses of shops and businesses that sell stamps.
Every two months you'll get a copy of the dub magazine, which is packed full of competitions and quizzes, and gives you the chance to exchange stamps with members around the world.
Why not start on an adventure which will give you years of pleasure? You'll spend many happy hours looking at the amazing variety of stamps in your collection or searching for unusual ones which you know are out there somewhere just waiting to be found. So join the Stamp Collectors' Club today and discover the fun and excitement of stamp collecting.

155,13,"The Ghan Train 

Mark Ottaway travelled by train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. 

The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through seemingly endless desert to the colder Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', which is perhaps unfortunate since it is known, above all, for being late. 
The dream of a rail link between Darwin and Adelaide was partly achieved in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide as far as Alice Springs, but there was often serious flooding on the line making it difficult for trains to pass. A new line was completed a few months before my journey. 
The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph and the Ghan is certainly not a high- speed, inter-city train - there are few stops and almost all passengers are holidaymakers. Nor does the Ghan aim to provide luxury in the same way that a train like the Orient Express does, although the on-board food is excellent. 
The railway was originally built to carry goods, not passengers. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to Australia's densely populated south via Darwin and the train, rather than around the continent by ship, would save time and money. 
It is not every day a transcontinental railway is completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. As I waited to board the Ghan, I could see that everyone was really looking forward to the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up the majority of my fellow travellers, were particularly keen to board. 
Our first stop, where the Ghan waited four hours, was at Katherine. Some passengers got off here and took a boat trip up the gorge. I didn't leave the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group of passengers and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged nowadays and few people do. Our group just walked around the rock and stayed to watch the beautiful sunset. 
From Alice Springs there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers break their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs isn't particularly interesting. There is a lot of flat land, with nothing to look at but cattle. But at dawn on the third day we reached the foothills of an area close to the Southern Ocean.

156,20,"The Skywalk 

The Grand Canyon in the United States was created by the River Colorado. People visit the Grand Canyon Park to go walking and running but mainly to look at the view. It is a wonderful view made even better by the Skywalk. The distance from the Skywalk to the bottom of the Grand Canyon is 1219 metres. It is a platform whose walls and floor are built of glass so that you can see the beautiful rocks of the canyon. Up to 120 people are allowed to stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007 and since then thousands of people have used it. You have to wear special covers over your shoes to avoid scratching the glass beneath your feet.

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay PS280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.'
Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

Like any other university, the Open University can give you a degree. 
However, you don't have to stop working to study. It can also open up a whole variety of interests. 
If you have never studied before, you will enjoy the special, new pleasure of increasing your knowledge. You will make friends of all kinds. You may also find that your qualification provides new career opportunities.

161,15,"Henry Ford 

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863 but he did not like farming. When he was fifteen he began work as a mechanic and in 1893 he built his first car. After he had driven it 1,500 kilometres, he sold it and built two bigger cars. Then, in 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he built cheap cars for ordinary people to buy. In 1908, he built the first Ford Model 'T', which sold for $825. He was soon selling 100 cars a day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but keeping things simple sometimes meant less choice.

The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's the time when you are learning about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, prefers to take pupils at three and four, although she has made lots of exceptions for keen five-year-olds. When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class consisted of her children's five-year-old school friends.
Margaret's pupils have group lessons. Each group has about a dozen pupils and each lesson lasts an hour, once a fortnight. In addition, each pupil has one individual lesson a week with her. Parents also have to attend the classes. It is important that the parents take an active interest in the lessons.
From the earliest lessons pupils learn to play by ear. They do not even try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time there is a big difference between their playing and reading of music.

163,34,"THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST 

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, in Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries she was the only woman scientist to have a place in the history books. 
Hypatia's father was director of Alexandria University, and he made sure his daughter had the best education available. This was unusual, as most women then had few opportunities to study. 
After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria where she began teaching mathematics. She soon became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. 
We have no copies of her books, but we know that she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented several scientific tools to help with her work.

164,53,"The History of Shoes 

In the past, importance was not given to shoes being comfortable or fashionable. These early foot coverings were probably animal skins, which people tied round their ankles during cold weather. We still use leather today, but other materials such as silk, plastic, or cotton are also popular, depending on what is in fashion. 
It was only one hundred and fifty years ago that people began to wear a different shoe on each foot. Formerly, the two shoes had been straight instead of shaped and could be worn on the left or the right foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now, although there are shoemakers still using their traditional skills, most shoes are now machine-made in large factories.

165,26,"THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH

In the 1880s, gold was discovered in what is now the most northern state of the USA,
Alaska. Many people came to the area hoping to get rich. New towns were built and grew quickly. One such town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. This town grew so quickly during 1909 that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. In the summer months, essential supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat, but in the winter the rivers and the ocean froze and there was no way to get to them. So, in 1910, a winter track was built which would be used by teams of dogs pulling sleds. They would take mail, food and clothes to the gold miners.
The track became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could get a warm bed for the night and something to eat for both themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when aeroplanes replaced steam boats and dog teams as the main form of transport.
However, the dogs had one last taste of fame in 1925, when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The disease could be cured, but, unfortunately, the closest medicine that could be found was in Anchorage, right on the other side of Alaska. Aeroplanes were still quite new, so no-one knew if they could fly in such cold weather. Also, Carl Eielson, the only pilot considered skilled enough to manage the flight, was away on a trip at the time. It was therefore agreed that the medicine would be transported using teams of dogs instead.
The trip covered over 1,000 kilometres, most of it along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska looking for gold, travelled the first 400 of those kilometres. He had to trust his dog Togo's ability to find his way in the blinding snow and Togo turned out to be a reliable guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point Balto refused to go any further, and saved the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria was stopped and Balto became a hero.
Nowadays a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925.

166,23,"ZOOS 

People began to keep animals in zoos over 3,000 years ago, when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos, animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. 
Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody approves of zoos. People who think that zoos are a good idea say they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Both of these would not be possible without zoos. On the other hand, some people disapprove of zoos because they believe it is wrong to put animals in cages, and argue that in zoos which are not managed properly, animals live in dirty conditions and eat unsuitable food.

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the cinema screen. The use of new ideas and advanced computer programs means that cartoons are becoming exciting again for people of all ages. 
By the end of the 1970s, the cinema world had decided that cartoons were only for children. 
But soon afterwards, one or two directors had some original new ideas. They proved that it was possible to make films in which both adults and children could share the fun.

168,18,"THE ROCKIES 

The Rocky Mountains run almost the length of North America.
They start in the North-west, but lie only a few hundred miles from the 
centre in more southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are no less wonderful. 
There are many roads across the Rockies, but the best way to see them is to travel by train. You start from Vancouver, the most attractive of Canada's big cities. Standing with its feet in the water and its head in the mountains, this city allows its residents to ski on slopes just 15 minutes by car from the city centre. 
Thirty passenger trains a day used to set off from Vancouver on the cross- continent railway. Now there are just three a week, but the ride is still a great adventure. You sleep on board, which is fun, but travel through some of the best scenery at night.

Norwich, the capital of the part of Britain known as East Anglia, has existed as a place to live for more than two thousand years. It began as a small village beside the River Wensum. At the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 it had grown to become one of the largest towns in England.
With two cathedrals and a mosque, Norwich has long been a popular centre for various religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and has recently celebrated its 900th anniversary, while Norwich itself had a year of celebration in 1994 to mark the 800th anniversary of the city receiving a Royal Charter. This allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself independently.
Today, in comparison with places like London or Manchester, Norwich is quite small, with a population of around 150,000, but in the 16th century Norwich was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years and got richer and richer, becoming famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in the year and as many pubs as there are days in the year.
Nowadays, there are far fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964 the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. With its fast-growing student population and its success as a modern commercial centre (Norwich is the biggest centre for insurance services outside London), the city new has a wide choice of entertainment: theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and a number of arts and leisure centres. There is also a football team, whose colours are green and yellow. The team is known as 'The Canaries', though nobody can be sure why.
Now the city's attractions include another important development, a modern shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. The people of Norwich lived with a very large hole in the middle of their city for over two years, as builders dug up the main car park. Lorries moved nearly a million tons of earth so that the roof of the Mall could become a city centre park, with attractive water pools and hundreds of trees. But the local people are really pleased that the old open market remains, right in the heart of the city and next to the new development.

170,14,"Sharks

Sharks are some of the most frightening creatures in our oceans. They are well prepared for feeding under water because they can see very well, and they can also feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. These make sharks very dangerous for smaller sea creatures that become their food. 
Although sharks are similar to other fish in a number of ways, their bodies are different. For example, unlike other fish, most sharks ought to swim all the time in order to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned over on their backs, they can stop moving completely. This is a very useful technique for researchers who are often required to handle sharks.

About the Railway
The twelve kilometre-long Nene Valley Railway passes through the lovely Nene Park, from an Eastern terminus at Peterborough to the Railway's headquarters at Wansford (next to the Al main road). A two-kilometre extension of the Railway takes passengers through Wansford Tunnel to the quiet beauty of Yarwell, the present Western end of the line.
Fares: adult PS10.00, child PS5.00, Family Fare (up to 2 adults and 3 children) PS25.00. Special prices may apply on public holidays.
Nene Park
With golf courses and a large Caravan Club site, why not make it a complete day out for the family by visiting Nene Park? There are thousands of hectares of public parkland with boating lakes, picnic areas and a nature reserve, as well as a miniature railway.
Wansford
Wansford Station is the home of a unique collection of historic trains from many parts of Europe. This includes such famous types as the elegant De Glen Compound locomotive from France, and the German Class 52 Kriegslok (the largest working steam engine in Britain) as well as '92 Squadron' and 'Mayflower' which were built in Britain. You can see these engines all year round whether or not the Nene Valley Railway is running.
The buffet, bar and souvenir shop, however, are only open on days when the train is running. A site entrance fee of PS2.00 for adults and PS1.00 for children is charged at Wansford.
A Famous Railway
Nene Valley Railway is a favourite with film makers, due in particular to its ability to take on the appearance of a railway in any part of Europe. Octopussy, in the series of James Bond movies, is a good example of what can be done. Corne and see where it was filmed.
Services for Schools
The Railway runs special timetable services from May to July to allow school groups to visit the railway and for teachers to set projects. The work can be done while pupils are here or in the classroom. A special educational pack is available, price PS1.50 plus postage. At other times of the year, school parties can hire the train ('Teddy Bear') with up to 3 carriages to travel along the Railway on non-service days. One month's prior booking is requested. There are special low fares for groups of 60 or more pupils. Telephone 01780 784444 for further information.
Private Hire of Trains

173,22,"The Albuquerque Balloon Festival

Every autumn, the sky above the desert city of Albuquerque in the south-western United States turns into a mass of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon festival, an annual nine-day event.
The first festival was held in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of the local radio station. There were about a dozen hot-air balloons and they took off from the car park in the middle of Albuquerque. From these small beginnings, the festival has grown steadily. This year at least a thousand balloons from over one third of the countries of the world are expected at its current out-of-town site.
What to see
The pilots are in radio contact with each other and all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. These are known as 'balloon glows' and are an opportunity to take fantastic photographs. However, you must arrive just after night has fallen or before 5.30 am to see these 'glows' as the balloons rise into the dark sky.
During the day, you can walk around among the balloons and chat to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in all sizes and colours, some in the shapes of animals or cartoon characters and, of course, well-known products such as varieties of soft drinks and fast food. Kids will love it.
In the afternoon, why not take to the sky yourself by arranging a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies offering balloon rides? Another possibility is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, the longest such ride anywhere, and enjoy a bird's-eye view of the festival. There are plenty of other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and firework displays on the opening evening and the last three evenings of the festival.
The Albuquerque Box
This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds, and at the same time create gentler currents of wind at different heights. This means that by rising or descending, skilful pilots can control the direction of their balloons.
Practical advice
Buy your tickets in advance (they are available on line) and save yourself a long wait to get into the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing. At night and in the early morning it can be quite cool, but during the day sunglasses and suncream are essential. Bring a flashlight for night-time events and, of course, bring your camera. If you're not a digital photographer, you'll need high-speed film for evening and night-time

174,42,"Joining the Kirov Ballet 

I'm Nathalie. Last year I was one of the youngest foreign students ever to join the Kirov's ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous as I didn't know anyone. Everyone gathered round, asking me questions, all in Russian. I tried to say something in Russian and they began talking in English so we managed to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is really nice to me, my Russian has improved enormously and I understand my teachers. 
For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me and when she left, I was a bit sad. In fact, I called home late at night once to speak to her because I felt a little lonely. 
Compared with my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are really hard, and I eat like an elephant to keep up my energy levels. That makes me confident I can perform to the school's high standards. In the evenings, I watch my favourite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD has finished. 
Now that I've settled down, I feel really at home here. I like walking around the city and going to the different shops - even during December when I couldn't believe how cold it was. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10oC, but the Russians said it was mild for the time of year! At least it was warm and cosy in my room. At the moment we are preparing for a new production and there's also a competition for young dancers which I'm going to enter. I feel so lucky to be here.

It can rain at any time between November and March in Marrakesh, Morocco. It doesn't happen frequently and when it does, the city's water pipes can't manage the sudden floods, which turn the streets into rivers. But, as many winters have remained dry in recent times, when the rain does come, it is welcomed by the local people. 
Marrakesh's parks and gardens exist, not because of the rain, but thanks to a network of underground channels, dug in the 11th century, which bring in water from the mountains all year round. Basically dry places, which receive their water in this way, are known as oases. 
Further south from Marrakesh, the traveller arrives at Skoura. Here every available piece of land is made into small squares by the water channels and used to grow food. The Atlas mountains, snow-covered in winter, provide a delightful background.

Welcome to the website. Here is all you need to know before booking a flight.
During the brief Antarctic summer, Antarctica Sightseeing Flights takes tourists in a full- size passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over the continent of Antarctica and back.
Flight dates for next year are not definite yet, but if you make a booking now, your deposit is transferable if we need to change the day.
Questions
These are answers to the most frequently asked questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.
How long is the flight?
The average flight is 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the remaining time travelling home. On the way to and from the continent, Antarctica experts who have lived on scientific research stations there give talks on the environment and history, and answer questions. A camera next to the pilot, which is linked to the video system on board, gives you a pilot's eye view throughout, from take-off to landing.
Will I get a seat next to a window?
All passengers are given two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, passengers are asked to move to the seat shown on their second boarding pass. Business and first class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a next-to-window seat for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or the seat next to a window seat for half of the flight and an end of row seat for the other half of the flight. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up from their seats and move about the plane, allowing everyone to share the sightseeing opportunities. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over various points of interest to allow these amazing sights to be seen equally well from both sides of the plane.
What happens if the weather is bad?
We have 17 different approved flight plans. Our captain looks at the satellite cloud picture on the morning of the flight and selects the direction which promises the clearest views.
Will I see penguins and other wildlife?
As most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, over 3,000 metres below the plane, we can't see them in any detail. We do not land on Antarctica, primarily for environmental reasons. To experience Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.
Can I take photographs?

On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book, address book and my purse, which contained about PS50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realised what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do: I'm 72 years old, I was a long way from home, and I was quite worried. In fact, I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened he said I should keep the fare.
I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people 

The members of our agency are aged 8-18. We collect news and write news reports, stories and articles. We send these to leading national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio and websites to be published. The news stories and articles by our members that are accepted by newspapers and TV and radio stations, can all be read or listened to on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centres around the country where young people can meet other members and get involved in projects, and we intend to open new centres nationwide.
Since our news agency started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says:
'I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I sat in a room with a team of young journalists and was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age wasn't important, they were trusted to do the stories on their own. 
I started going to the Eight-eighteen centre in my city, got some training, then was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen has helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With all the skills I learnt, I got a job at 19, and am currently the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles written by the journalists before putting them onto the site.' 

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you'll be trained and you'll take part in monthly meetings to decide who is going to be responsible for writing each news story.
Eight-eighteen encourages skills-sharing between members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced Eight-eighteen members who are 12 years old and over. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they become more experienced as trainers, some members present sessions to audiences of young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.
Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next new-members' training will be in February.

180,31,"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London intending to study law, but went to art school instead. There he found the traditional drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting.
In his late twenties he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and wanted to put this light into his paintings.
This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark, but he insists he's never sure what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.'
Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards.
Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.'
Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters.

Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding beneath the melting snow, waiting to send you off the road. The car coming towards you may suddenly slide across the road.
Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Uneven movements can make a car suddenly very difficult to control. So every time you either turn the wheel, touch the brakes or increase your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it.

182,30,"THE ICEHOTEL 

For many years the Arctic was a popular destination in the summer season to see the land of the midnight sun but in winter the few inhabitants had the snow and ice to themselves. By the end of the 1980s it was decided that the dark and cold winter should be seen as an advantage. In the winter of 1990 the French artist Jannot Derit was invited to have the opening of an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the little town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. The building, named Arctic Hall, attracted many interested visitors to the area. One night a group of foreign guests decided it would be a good idea to sleep in the Arctic Hall. The following morning the brave group were very pleased with their experience and the idea of an ice hotel was born. Today it is world famous. 
As soon as winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects and artists from all over the world come to Jukkasjarvi and they make the hotel for that year. As one part is completed, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December and each week after that a new part opens, until January 7th when the hotel is completed. As the ICEHOTEL is built under the open sky, using the natural materials of the winter season, the finishing date depends on nature and therefore there are sometimes changes to the plan. In the spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. 
Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 degC to -8 degC, however cold it may be outside. Winter outer clothes such as warm overalls, hats and gloves are included in the cost of guests' stay at the hotel. In addition to this, it is a good idea for guests to bring sweaters and a scarf as well as plenty of woollen socks and to choose footwear that is larger than normal to allow space for thick socks.

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It consists of water and sugars. Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. In fact, there are more than three hundred varieties of honey. 
The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. 
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very

Have you ever thought of joining a book dub and buying new books through the post? Here at the International Book Club, we already have many members buying books from us by mail.
To join:
You just need to send us your first order from our book list.
Immediate benefits:
As a special offer, you may choose any reduced-price books from our new members' book list, to the value of PS6 in total (plus postage and packing). By doing this, you will save pound on the publishers' prices.
Tick the box on your form to order a free watch.
If you reply within seven days, we will send you another free gift carefully chosen from our book list by our staff.
Order a DVD from the many on offer in our list, at half the recommended retail price.
When you've joined:
As a member, you'll enjoy savings of between 30% and 50% off the publisher's price on every book you buy, and what's more, they'll come straight to your door. Your free club magazine arrives once a month, to keep you up to date with the latest best-sellers. This means that every year we offer over 1,000 books to choose from. On the Internet, you can find all our titles for the year on our exclusive members' website.
Being a member:
All we are asking you to do while you are a member is to choose four books during your first year. After that, you can decide on the number of books you wish to take.
In each of our monthly club magazines, our experienced staff choose a Club Choice book - a work of fiction or a reference title which they feel is particularly worth buying, and which is offered at an extra-special price. However, if you do not want this book, just say so in the space provided on the form. We will always send the book if we do not receive this.
So, return your application form today, but hurry - it's not every day we can make you an offer like this. To apply to become a member, all you need to do is simply fill in the enclosed form and return it in the postage-paid envelope supplied.
Before you know it, your books will be with you. Please don't send any money now, as we will send you your bill with the books.

185,6,"Atlantic College

Last week I went to visit Atlantic College, an excellent private college in Wales. Unusually, it gives young people much needed experience of life outside the classroom, as well as the opportunity to study for their exams. The students, who are aged between 16 and 18 and come from all over the world, spend the morning studying. In the afternoon they go out and do a really useful activity, such as helping on the farm, looking after people with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers.
One of the great things about Atlantic College students is that they come from many different social backgrounds and countries. As few can afford the fees of PS20,000 over two years, grants are available. A quarter of the students are British, and many of those can only attend because they receive government help.
""I really admire the college for trying to encourage international understanding among young people"", as Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said. ""You learn to live with people and respect them, even the ones you don't like. During the summer holidays my mother couldn't believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here again' is a followup to 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums.
It is clear from the first song on the CD which is a dance tune that the band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The second tune is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most later lacks are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single though because they are excellent.
Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as dl the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.)
On this CD Moonshine show they can produce perfect music in a variety of styles from the slow ones we are familiar with to the ones that will keep your feet tapping. I did feel though that they put their best songs at the beginning and the last few tracks were not of quite the same quality.

187,25,"A JOURNEY ALONG THE BEAUTIFUL DOURO RIVER

VOYAGES JULES VERNE operate a 'hotel ship' along the Douro river in Portugal. The MV Lady
Ivy May can take 160 guests in double cabins, all of which face outside and have a private shower and WC. On board the ship, which has air-conditioning, you will find a sun-deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop and library facilities.

Itinerary
Day 1 Depart in the early evening from London Heathrow to Oporto. Your guide will meet you on arrival and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.
Day 2 After a morning's sightseeing in Oporto, you will return to the ship and depart for Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey up the river takes four hours.
Day 3 You will continue travelling up the river. In the early evening, the ship stops at Peso da Regua, where port wine is produced. At dinner you will be able to try the delicious food and drink from this area.
Day 4 After breakfast you will travel south by bus to the ancient town of Lamego and visit the cathedral, several churches and a museum. The museum was formerly a palace and now has an excellent collection of paintings, tapestries and sculptures. You will then return to the ship and sail on to Tua.
Day 5 At this point the Douro becomes very narrow. Depending on the depth of the river at the time, you may be able to continue by a smaller boat to the Spanish frontier at Barca d'Alva. The return journey to Tua is by coach and there is much to see along the way.
Day 6 In the morning you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for one of the most wonderful views in the whole of the Douro valley. You will return to the ship for lunch and then join the Douro river valley railway for a beautiful ride through the countryside to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting for you.

You could win PS1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky people will win a cheque forPS100.
Once again, we need people who can write good stories. The judges, who include Mary Littlejohn, the novelist, Michael Brown, the television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, Keep Writing's editor, are looking for interesting and original stories. Detective fiction was extremely popular last year, although the competition winner produced a love story. You can write about whatever you want but here's some advice to start you thinking:
Write about what you know
This is the advice which every writer should pay attention to and, last year, nearly everyone who wrote for us did exactly that. Love, family, problems with friends - these were the main subjects of the stories. However, you need to turn ordinary situations into something interesting that people will want to read about. Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way.
Get your facts right
It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it.
Hold the reader's attention
Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end.
Think about the characters
Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.
Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words and typed, double-spaced, on one side only of each sheet of paper.
Even if you're in danger of missing the closing date, we are unable to accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately your story cannot be returned, nor can we discuss our decisions.
You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country - a change in the rules by popular request- and the story must not have appeared in print or in recorded form, for example on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.
Your fee of PS5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to:

189,49,"San Francisco 

San Francisco lies on the coast of northern California. The earliest Europeans to discover the area were led by a Spanish explorer whose name was Gaspar de Portola. 
He first saw it in 1769. Surprisingly, although San Francisco Bay is a wonderful natural harbour, it was discovered by land rather than by sea. 
In 1849, people arrived in San Francisco in their thousands hoping to find gold. However, it was not the men looking for the gold that got rich. The richest people made their money from owning banks and law firms and they built themselves large houses on one of the hills. This was known as Nob Hill. 
Nowadays, tourists are attracted to San Francisco because there they can see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many even take the short boat trip to the island of Alcatraz to see the former prison.

When I injured my back I had to take a break from my running career. I decided to introduce more women to the sport, to show them how much fun it can be and to give them the confidence to get out and run.
I decided to start a running dub for women in my area because I was annoyed by the attitude of many race organisers. They complain about the lack of women in the sport but also use this as an excuse for not providing separate changing facilities.
I put up posters and 40 women, young and old, fit and unfit, joined. All of them were attracted by the idea of losing weight but I don't think they had really thought about running before. When or if they did, they had a picture of painful training. They didn't think of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river.
At first they ran for only a minute - now they can run for thirty minutes. They've also learned from other runners about diet and keeping fit in general.

In a park in a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers. But all last week he was in Tokyo and millions of Japanese people watched the thirty-five-year-old gardener on television because John is the number one singer in Japan at the moment. John visited Japan a few months ago to sing in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on his radio show. Hundreds of young people phoned the radio and asked the disc jockey to play the songs once more.
John, who uses the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, is not going to stop working in the park in England. He does not know yet how much he will earn from his music. 'I must keep my job in the park,' he says. 'I still have to pay my bills!' The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan. They've never even heard him sing.
John's wife, Denise, a hospital worker, says, 'This will not change the way we live.

193,24,"Dear Deshini, 
It's great that you are my new penfriend. My name is Tom and I am fifteen years old. I was born in Canada but I live in England now. Please write and tell me all about your life in India. I would love to go there one day. 
Do you live in a small village or in a big town? What is your school like? Have you got any pictures of your school you could send me? I'm sending you a few photos of my family. I'll send more the next time I write.

I lost my bag on a train last week. I was on the 8.30 a.m. train to Cambridge on 10th May. It is a large blue bag and my name is written on the outside. Have you found this bag?
Yours faithfully, 
Mary Johnson

197,1,"Otters 

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and
make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out of their
homes at night. Otters are very good in the water and can swim at more than 
10 kilometres an hour. They have thick brown hair and this keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This means otters can stay under water for several minutes.

198,49,"Dear Jacqueline, 
Would you like to come to the cinema with me after school today? We can go to see Pocahontas at the ABC cinema. The film starts at 6 o'clock. Shall we meet outside the cinema? 
Love, 
Isabella

Dear Isabella,
I am very sorry but I can't go to the cinema this evening. My mother has some work, and I am going to cook dinner. Why don't you invite Karen to go? I hope you like the film. You can tell me about it tomorrow.

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler keep cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep.
She has 50 sheep and each one has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts this wool off the sheep so they won't get too warm. Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer and the weather was hot so people didn't want to buy sweaters. She then made some socks. Everybody loved them because they were cheap, strong and easy to wash.
That's how Jenny's business started. At first she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers so she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made on machines. There are six colours, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen and skiers. Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a favourite present.

200,58,"Dear Lynne and Tony, 

I'm writing to say thank you for the two nights I stayed in 
your lovely home. It was good to see you again. 
Here are the photographs of your children that you asked for. They're good photos, aren't they? I hope you like them. I really love my new camera. 
I am going to visit my sister in New York next week. I will take a lot of photos there, too. I haven't seen my sister for a long time.
Thanks again.

Dear John,
Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a very good teacher. I enjoyed my stay in Cambridge. 
Now I am staying at my brother's flat. He is studying to be a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then go home to Greece.
I like London very much. We travelled to Regents Park by bus yesterday. It was very sunny and we had a good time.
Tonight, I am going to see a film with my brother and some of his friends.

203,40,"Schnauzer Dogs

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dog.
The two smaller sizes first came to England over 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer has not been here very long. The name Giant is a good one because the dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm high.
All the dogs have long hair, which should be cut quite often. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey in colour, but the Giant Schnauzer is usually black.
Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use the dogs to help them with their sheep, and they are also used by the police, because Schnauzer dogs are very intelligent.

204,53,"Dear Mrs Brian,

I am sorry but I can't come to your class any more because I have to return to my country. My sister is going to get married next month. I want to go shopping with her to choose a dress. My parents are going to make a big meal for the guests and there will be a lot of work in the kitchen.
I'm sorry I will leave the English class. You are a very good teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me.
Thanks again.

205,39,"Parrots 

Perhaps you have seen these beautiful birds, with their lovely colours and long tails in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots are found in countries like Brazil, Australia and India. They usually live in large groups and because they like to eat fruit, they are sometimes a problem for farmers. 
There are many different kinds of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet, which they use for climbing and holding food. The biggest birds can live for up to 80 years. 
They are very noisy, but they are clever birds and it is easy to teach them to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows, where you can see the birds doing things they have learned.

There are many different kinds of cats. They are different in size and they do not look or act the same. 
Tigers are the biggest cats. From head to tail they can be 3.7m long. Most cats don't like water, but tigers will often lie in a pool of water when it is hot! 
Lions are the only cats that stay together in large family groups. Several lions may work together to get food for the group. They usually live in flat, open countryside where they can see a long way and easily follow other animals. 
All cats need good eyes, because they catch smaller animals for their food. They also need to be fast, and very strong.

Dear Mary, 
I will be in London next Thursday morning. Would you like to have lunch with me? Write and tell me when you are free and where I can meet you. 
Hope to see you then.

Dear Joan,
Thanks for you letter. I got it this morning. Yes. I'd love to see you. How about meeting outside my office at one o'clock? There's a good Italian restaurant near there. Do you like Italian food?
I have to be back at work by two o'clock, so please don't be late!

210,51,"The Ruwenzori Mountains 

Mary Daniels is a student in England. This year she had a very interesting summer holiday. She travelled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help make a road through a forest between two big towns. 'It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops where we could buy food,' said Mary. 'It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places in the world.'

211,63,"Dear Mike, 
I am sorry you could not come to my party yesterday. Jon told me you had a very bad cold and you decided to stay in bed. Are you feeling better now? 
It was a very good party; the nicest I have ever had! Lots of my friends were there and they gave me some lovely presents. I will tell you more about the party when you come to school on Monday.

212,5,"ESTHER'S STORY

When Esther left school at the age of sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her PS500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends decided to go to college, but Esther used her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar and some glass jars and began making her own jam. She sold the jam for PS1 a jar to her friends and she soon doubled her aunt's PS500.
At first, her parents didn't want Esther to spend her time making jam and they thought that she should study instead. They hoped that one day she would be a teacher or a doctor. But Esther didn't listen to them. She just kept on making jam. After a few months, she started selling it to the local market. Then she started making orange juice. She sold this to a school where one of her friends worked.
After two years, her business was very large and her parents were very pleased with her. She made all kinds of food which she sold to shops and supermarkets.

213,56,"The Cerne Giant 

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are quite near each other. On the road between them, there are a lot of green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a picture of a very large man. The man in the picture is called the Cerne Giant because the village that is next to 
him is called Cerne.
Nobody really knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think that it was a very long time ago. To get nearer the picture, you can walk from

215,11,"Dear Maria,

It's good to be back home in my country but I still think about all the friends I made in our English class, especially you. I cried when I left England because my visit was too short. I would like to return to England but next time I will stay in a different city. 
I have started English classes again here. I learnt a lot of things in England but I know I need to study even harder.

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you come to Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake becomes ice, and thousands of Canadian fishermen travel there each weekend. They build little houses of wood on the ice and paint them in bright colours. Then they sit inside to catch the fish that swim under the ice.
Bob Marvisch has come here at this time of year for twenty-five years. 'You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters and a snow suit on top. Catching the fish. is easy,' he says. 'First you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Next you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. They are between ten and twenty centimetres long. Some people like to eat them, but when I have caught three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or other snack! Today I have caught twenty-five!

217,19,"Mount Kilimanjaro 

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. 
There are several paths to the top. People think that the five-kilometre Marangu path is the easiest. It takes about five days and is very popular with tourists. 
Only half of the climbers who try to climb Kilimanjaro get to the top. This is often because the weather can change so suddenly. At the beginning, it can be hot and wet but when climbers reach the top, they find ice and snow and the temperature may be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to pack both sunglasses and warm clothes!

219,16,"Gail Rollins 

Gail Rollins is one of Edinburgh's best runners. This summer she wants to run the 10,000 metres - and possibly the 5,000 metres - at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was well known for coming second in big competitions. But she always laughed and smiled, and people in her home city love her for this. But all that changed in 2004 when she ran in her first ever half-marathon, a very long road race. She won in a very good time, the fastest of the year by any British woman runner. 
Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also raced when he was younger, but he had to stop running in competitions when he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes practises with Gail. But it's no fun for Mike when Gail goes past him and he can't catch her up. 
Gail practises hard. She does a long run in the morning, followed by fast runs in the afternoon. But she always has a rest from running on Sundays. 'I am with her all the time,' says Mike. 'Sometimes I say, ""Are you sure you should be eating that?"" It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything.'

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry and we build stadiums so we can watch football matches and pop concerts. We use other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things in. 
Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building is going to look and draws pictures that show people his or her ideas. Engineers make sure the building will be strong and safe. Then, the workers carefully build it. 
The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a lovely roof. But the building is beautiful from every side, not only from the top. There is also a famous roof on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting building looks like a tent that is made of glass.

225,41,"The History of Farming 

Before people started farming, they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and slowly their villages got bigger. 
Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and then some people did not get enough food to eat. 
Today, farmers can grow more food and it travels thousands of kilometres from where it is grown to our homes.

227,6,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL 

In 1783, two French brothers built the first balloon to take people into the air. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew in it. This was in the United States. Then, in 1918, the US Post Office began the first airmail service. 
Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. 
In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and it can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the journey from London to New York is only four hours.
Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is difficult to think of a world without them.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I would like a room at your hotel for three nights from September 15th to 17th.
I'd like a single room with a shower. I also need a telephone in my room. Please can I have a quiet room on the ground floor?
I am going to drive to the hotel. Is there a hotel car park?
I will arrive at about 10.30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would like a meal when I arrive.
Thank you for your help.

229,48,"THE OSTRICH 

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can be more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few of them left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they are running. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour, so it is very difficult for other animals to catch them. 
Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to become adults. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water.

I have a problem and I need your help. Can you come shopping with me tomorrow? My grandmother is going to turn 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. 
The problem is I don't have anything to wear. I have grown so much that all my trousers are too short for me now! I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I haven't got a lot of money to spend but I think it will be enough.

231,64,"TO ALL STUDENTS:

Would you like to come on a camping trip this weekend?
We are going to go to the forest in the school bus and we will stay at a camp-site from Friday to Sunday. It has hot showers and a small shop and you can rent bicycles there.
The trip costs PS25. It is very cold there at night, so you should take warm clothes and you will need to wear strong shoes. 
If you want yo come, tell me today.

232,57,"Dear Lorna,

How are you? I'm happy because last month I got a new job in the city centre. I am working in a Tourist Information Office and it is very interesting. I start work every morning at half past seven, so I have to get up very early! I love this job because I meet people from a variety of different countries. I like telling them about our city. Here is a photo of me. I'm wearing my new uniform. Do you like it?

233,10,"CROCODILES 

We can find crocodiles in tropical parts of the world, for example Africa, South America and Northern Australia. 
They spend most of the time in slow-moving water but they can move fast through the water and on land. 
You often see crocodiles together in large groups. They eat everything they catch, like fish, birds and small animals. And sometimes they make a meal of large animals or even people. 
There are more than ten types of crocodile. They all have very sharp teeth. They often lose these teeth, but soon get new ones. 
Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 metres long, but some are much bigger. Crocodiles live for a long time. The oldest one kept in a zoo was 66 years old.

234,27,"Dear David,
I am going to visit your country next month. I'm going to travel with two friends. We don't know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We would like to stay somewhere in the centre. Can you help us?
Carlos

Dear Carlos,
Hotels in the centre are expensive, but I have good news. I have spoken to my aunt Gloria about you and she says you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms that my house! That will be alright with you, won't it?

235,60,"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a beautiful village about fifty kilometres west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr Bonnier's name yet, but he's already quite famous in France. This is because he has written in French magazines about almost all the best restaurants in that country. He's only 29 years old.
When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his mother and father. He liked doing this so much that he decided not to buy lots of clothes and CDs; instead, he used his money to visit France and eat in good restaurants. He also bought a lot of French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!
So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been an easy thing to do?

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is a much higher number than the USA and means it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like watching films better than any other free-time activity and ten million of them go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are an important part of every film. Indian films are also enjoyed outside India. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they are not paid as much. This is why most Bollywood films only cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film is never made for under $5 million.

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died.
The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.
Dinosaurs didn't all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were giants. The largest were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. The Brontosaurus, for example, was twenty metres long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was stronger. It had sharp teeth for eating meat.

238,13,"The Weather 

People are interested in the weather for a lot of reasons and it is important for people in many different jobs. For example, the weather makes a big difference for farmers. 
Many years ago, farmers spent a long time looking at the sky and at animals and flowers to try and learn more about the weather. Now there are lots of computer programmes which help us to learn about the weather, and people can even get weather information on their mobile phones. 
Today, a lot of people still believe in the old ideas about the weather. They say, for example, that if there is a red sky in the evening, it will be sunny the next day.

239,50,"POSTCARDS 

Today, people like to send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains or castles on them and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because postcards are cheap and the pictures on them are often better than people's own photos. 
Somebody sent the first postcard at the end of the nineteenth century. It had a picture of a town by the sea on it. Later on, postcards had pictures showing something in the news that week, perhaps an accident or an important person's visit.
