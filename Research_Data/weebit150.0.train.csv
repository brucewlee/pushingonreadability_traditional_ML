A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells.
Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards.
Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes.
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians.
Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land.
For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land.

Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A

Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.
What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?

In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.

George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath.
In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant?
In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there.
An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!
George Washington's inaugural address in 1793 was the shortest. His speech lasted only eight minutes. In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. It lasted almost two hours!
Cold weather caused quite a problem at the inaugural ball for Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. The ball was held in a tent, which wasn't heated, and the valves on the band's musical instruments froze!
In 1981, guests at Ronald Reagan's inaugural balls received a sweet treat. Forty million jelly beans--one of Reagan's favorite candies--were eaten to celebrate!

The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.
The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.
""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""

Experts first discovered this frog in 1914 in eastern Australia. It may be extinct because of disease and habitat loss.
Scientists hope to find this spotted toad in rivers and rain forests in Ecuador. The animal faces threats including pollution and disease.

In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food.
Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100.

When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.

A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be

The spiders use dead insects and other materials to make the decoys. The decoys are about the same size and shape as the spiders.
Spiders may be the only creatures other than humans to make life-size models of their own bodies, according to researchers. Our study seems to be the first to [show] animal-made decoys, scientist I-Min Tso told reporters.

The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade.
Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade.
The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities.
""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me.
The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927.
The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year.
Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade.
A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years.
In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below.
To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike
Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield.
Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky.
In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City.
Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float.
Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars.
All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City.
Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar systems giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

A baby rattlesnake sheds its skin for the first time about two weeks after it hatches. A rattlesnake shakes its rattle to warn other animals that it is nearby.
Many baby rattlesnakes don't live to become adults. Because of the babies' small size, other animals

Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.

After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid.
completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded,
would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [
] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth.
NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.

About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say.
There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.

Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs!

465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.

 The team began by scanning this mold of Washington's face into a computer. A sculptor had made the mold of the 53-year-old Washington's face in 1785. Washington's
or false teeth, showed the shape of his mouth.
 Once the team had an idea of what Washington's face looked like at age 53, sculptors re-created the face to show what it would have looked like at age 45. The nose and ears continue to grow during adulthood, so those features were sculpted smaller.
 Painters added color to the statue based on historical documents that depict Washington with pale skin and grayish blue eyes.
 The statue was placed in an exhibit that shows Washington leading his troops during the long winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1777.

In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become
, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild.
Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are
creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees.
To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects.
""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive.""
What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest
Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors.
Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat.
In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets.
To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees.
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told
. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well.""
The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age.
The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water.

389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off. Squid have eight arms, two tentacles, and two huge eyes that can each grow to the size of a volleyball!

During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.

What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on armor and talk to tour guides. This year, more than 2.4 million people from across the country are expected to attend Jamestown events.
Stepping into Jamestown Settlement museum in Virginia is like stepping into the past. And that's just what thousands of people are planning to do this spring. May marks the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in North America. Organizers are expecting nearly 90,000 visitors on the weekend of May 11 to 13, when many major events are planned.
Jamestown is a tourist destination for people who want a frontrow seat to American history. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of Jamestown and the world in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told
Davidson helped put together exhibits at the Jamestown museum for the anniversary.
Visitors to Jamestown Settlement can try on English armor and watch experts demonstrate how to fire muskets. Tourists can also go aboard and explore
or models, of the three ships that brought the first settlers to present-day Virginia.
The story of Jamestown began on May 14, 1607, when about 100 English men and boys arrived in present-day Virginia. They came seeking gold and other treasures. The settlers, called
built a fort on the bank of a river and named their colony Jamestown, after King James I of England.
or businesspeople, of the Virginia Company to make money in North America. But the settlers faced many problems, including disease, starvation, and conflict with the area's Powhatan people (see ""
At first, settlers stayed close together for protection. ""There were hundreds of people living inside a wooden-walled fort,"" explains Davidson. Living in the fort helped the settlers defend themselves from attack, but it also made hunting for food or growing crops difficult.
Captain John Smith was one of Jamestown's original leaders. He took command of the colony in 1608. When the colony was in danger of running out of food, Smith gave an order: ""He who does not work, will not eat.""
spent five months crossing the Atlantic. The original Godspeed carried 39 passengers from England to Virginia, making two stops along the way. The new Godspeed traveled from Maine to Virginia, stopping along the way to let visitors see the ship.
By 1613, Jamestown had expanded into a successful colony. At about that time, the settlers began to grow tobacco. Tobacco was a
meaning that it could be sold in large amounts to England. In the following years, the settlers pushed the Powhatan off the land and built tobacco
or large farms. Later, the Jamestown colonists bought slaves from Africa to work on the plantations.
Over time, Jamestown grew to become the colony of Virginia. Virginia was one of the 13 colonies that joined in 1776 to rebel against England, starting the American Revolution (17751783).
Much is known about Jamestown, yet more details are being discovered. For more than a hundred years, experts thought the site of the original settlement had been destroyed by the James River. In 1994, archaeologists, or scientists who study the remains left behind by past cultures, discovered what may be Jamestown's original location.
""Visitors can see things being excavated that haven't seen the light of day in 400 years,"" Jamestown spokesperson Mike Litterst told
Scientists are currently looking for the foundation of the first church that the Jamestown settlers built. If found, it will be the oldest English church ever discovered in the United States.
The skeletons of two settlers have already been uncovered at the site. They are on display beneath a glass case, exactly as they were found. Historians believe that one of the skeletons is that of Captain Bartholomew Gosnoll, a member of Jamestown's original ruling council. Gosnoll and Jamestown Settlement will have a lot of visitors in the coming weeks for the 400th anniversary. ""It's the biggest event we've had since 1957, when the [Jamestown] museum first opened,"" says Litterst.
When the English colonists first settled in what is now Virginia, a powerful Native American group had lived on the land for hundreds of years. ""There were about 20,000 Powhatan people there when the English arrived in Jamestown,"" Virginia Indian culture expert Karenne Wood told
She hopes that the 400th anniversary of Jamestown will help shed light on the Powhatan's story.
When Jamestown began, the English and the Powhatan tried to trade with each other peacefully, but soon fighting broke out over land and resources. Beginning in 1614, the fighting stopped for eight years when Pocahontas, a daughter of the Powhatan chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. However, the fighting quickly resumed as Jamestown expanded.
Over time, the Powhatan people lost their land to the English settlers. However, Virginia is home to many Native American descendants today. ""We have changed a lot,"" says Wood, ""but we are still here.""
Organizers at Jamestown are not calling the 400th anniversary a celebration. Why might that be?

The game did not end with a tie-breaking shoot-out, however. It ended because of a fight between parents and coaches.

No one was hurt and no kids were involved in the fight. But many towns across the United States are wondering what can be done to stop these kinds of ugly scenes from happening.

Scientists compared Borneo's clouded leopards with similar cats found on Southeast Asia's mainland. They paid special attention to the marks on the animals' skin.

Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.
Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.

However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online.
Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store.
There are laws that exist to protect the rights of musicians. The laws say it is illegal to copy songs without permission from musicians and record companies.
During the past three years, CD sales have fallen. The recording industry says it loses billions of dollars each year when people

The lawsuits have left many people stunned. Some are concerned that innocent people might be wrongly accused when their children or grandchildren download music. One 71-year-old grandfather from Texas is being sued. He didn't know that his grandchildren had copied music onto his computer.
Some people have said they didn't know they were breaking the law. Others think the record companies are bullies picking on ordinary people.

45% - all right, with a few friends
Many people don't like paying high prices for music CDs. They say they like to get their music online because it's easy-and it's free.
During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet.
To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98.
For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied.
Do you think fear of being punished will stop people from swapping music online? Why or why not?

61,"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, homeland security has become an important issue for many people.
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on
. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe.
President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan.
In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005.
Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment.
Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security.
Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records.
If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.

Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

Collectible coins and currency worth about $1 billion were on display at the World's Fair of Money. The fair was held this August in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions.
The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies.
, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand.""
Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each.
A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million.
Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition.
Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny.
Each day, the government prints 37 million bills, worth about $696 million.
About 18 tons of ink per day go into printing those bills.
If you had $10 billion and you spent $1 every second of every day, you would go broke in 317 years.

Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and

CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color.
are also called the northern lights and southern lights.
Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights.
Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora.
The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras.
Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun.
If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops.
Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.

137,"Standing atop a hill this summer in the dense jungles of Guatemala, a country in Central America, scientist Arthur Demarest felt his feet sink into the jungle vines.
Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building.
As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900.
Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city
, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancun was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan.
So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said.
Demarest said Cancun is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancun doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancun needed neither.""
The drawing shows an artist's idea of what the Cancun palace might have looked like.
Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on
, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare.
Located near the Pasin River, Cancun was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world.""
Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen.
Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to
, or dig out, Cancun. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancun is ""by far the most spectacular.""
The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes.""

Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
A century ago, the U.S. government set aside Mesa Verde (MAYsuh VER-day) as a national park. The park protects the ancient Native American city known for its multistoried cliff dwellings built into canyon walls on a large

The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who
or lived, in the area more than 1,000 years ago. They mainly farmed corn, beans, and squash.
From 600 until the 1100s, the Ancient Pueblo lived primarily on the
top. (A mesa is a plateau with steep sides.) They later moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there. After 1300, they
or traveled, south to New Mexico and Arizona.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park. ""It was worthwhile to celebrate the past that comes from the Pueblo people as well as our nations past. [The centennial] provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
is Spanish for ""green table."" Spanish explorers named the region for its high, tree-covered plateaus.
Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo of the Southwest rely on farming rather than hunting?

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book

Lava from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii hits the sea.
Tourists watched in awe as a huge chunk of Hawaiis coastline broke off and fell into the ocean. More than 44 acres of coastline collapsed and sent a glowing swirl of red-hot
bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.
""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone.
Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.
Thin strands of wiry volcanic glass, called Peles hair, were found about 2,000 feet away. Peles hair is a type of
which forms from lava that cools and hardens. According to myth, Pele was the Hawaiian goddess of fire.

Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word

To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.

Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main

Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.

Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

Bakers can use that information to adjust the temperature during the cooling process. Scientists hope the discovery will help keep cookies from crumbling during normal handling.

208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital.
In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies.
Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together.
Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.""
What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America.""
George Washington's second inaugural speech, in 1793, was the shortest on record. At only 135 words, it lasted just eight minutes.
In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. At 8,445 words, it lasted almost two hours!
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge's inaugural speech was the first broadcast on the radio.
Harry S. Truman's speech in 1949 was the first to be shown on television.
After Jimmy Carter was sworn in as president in 1977, he became the first president to walk the parade route instead of riding in a car.
In 1997, Bill Clinton's inauguration was the first to be transmitted over the Internet.

The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe.
Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets.
, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets.
If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver.
The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars.
After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released.
Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told
that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said.
California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday.
Why are scavengers an important part of the food chain?
Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos.
Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter.

Ostriches don't fly. Instead, they use their wings to attract mates, alert other ostriches to danger, and keep their balance. Being stuck on the ground doesn't slow ostriches down, though. They can run as fast as a car can travel--up to 50 miles an hour for about 30 minutes.
At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs.

Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to
Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents.
Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected.

Here's one message you never want to forget: ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which runs from October 5 through October 11.
For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:
. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies.

Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.
Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.
Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.
Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.

The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.

Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance.
A glider does not have an engine.
Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds.
No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

Remember that we can only see the part of the Moon that reflects the Sun's light. How much of that we can see depends upon the position of the Moon in its orbit.
This slideshow shows the phases of the Moon, as seen from the Earth.
A common mistake is to think that the phases of the Moon happen because the Earth gets in the way, and casts its shadow onto the Moon. That is not how the phases are caused.

Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.

A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model
so mast height on real boat  20 = mast height on model
400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm  20 =
Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000

A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called

Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the

Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by

You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Characters
In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet.
It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet.
Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day.

The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.

271,"> Preparing, planning and checking - Punctuation
The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end:
The starts are easy; they should all have capital letters.
The endings have full stops (or the equivalent, such as question marks). However, endings cannot have commas. Commas are only used inside sentences, never right at the end of one.
One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in.
Other areas which often cause problems are:
If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them!
Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question.
Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled.
To show when a letter has been missed out:
Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation.

Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.
Check our ideas on the extract by clicking the button below.
He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding.

The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.

265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.

395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.

 But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid, since she is envious:
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
 It is my lady!  O, it is my love!
She speaks  yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses. I will answer it.
 I am too bold. Tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night!
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O speak again, bright angel!  For thou art
As glorious to this night, being oer my head,
As is a wingd messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name 
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet.

Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Whats Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Whats in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet.
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name 
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Call me but love, and Ill be new-baptized.
What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night
I know not how to tell thee who I am.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongues uttering, yet I know the sound.

How camst thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out 
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity.

By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form  fain, fain deny
What I have spoke.  But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay 
And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers perjuries
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
Ill frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo  but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light.
But trust me, gentleman, Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discoverd.
Lady, by yonder blessd moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops 
O swear not by the moon, th inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight.

Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.

May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.

And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The proposal
Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.

Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called

Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:

We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""

This literally means 'sounding together'. Homophonic music is played in block chords. Sometimes, homophonic music is called chordal music, it means the same thing.
Here is an example of music with a homophonic texture, written by Henry VIII.
This literally means 'different sounds or voices'. Polyphonic music has parts that weave in and out of each other. Sometimes this is called contrapuntal music - it means the same thing.
Polyphonic music may contain an element of imitation, where one voice or instrument copies what has just been played by another. (Think of a roundsong like
Listen to this example of music that has a polyphonic texture, from JS Bach's
A fugue is a special type of polyphonic texture. Fugues always begin with a tune that is played on a solo instrument/voice or by instruments/voices in unison. This tune is then played by all the other instruments or voices in turn but not necessarily at the same pitch.
Here is an example of a fugue. Notice how the solo starts the fugue tune and then the other voices join in one at a time.
A capella music is always for voices. It describes vocal music that has no instrumental accompaniment.
A capella music can be polyphonic, homophonic or unison - so you might see a piece of music described as 'homophonic a capella' or 'polyphonic a capella'.
The words 'a capella' in Italian mean 'In the style of the chapel'. This is because early music for the church was for unaccompanied voices.
Listen to this example of a capella singing - yodelling from Gabon in Africa.
This is a melody which can be sung or played on an instrument, with an accompaniment. A song with piano accompaniment falls into this category.
Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.

Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

A ringing bell does not normally cause salivation in dogs. However, when the ringing bell becomes a secondary stimulus, it does cause salivation, even though the dog will not be able to eat the bell as food.
This is now called a conditioned reflex. In a conditioned reflex the final response (salivation) has no direct connection with the stimulus (ringing bell).

The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.

Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards.
Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by
. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures.
Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users.
At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell.
Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products.
Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes.
Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers.
The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.
formal rules adopted by Parliament and enforced by government
guidelines or specifications which are widely agreed and commonly accepted, but do not necessarily have the force of law
exist to protect the consumer from faulty or sub-standard goods and services. There are a wide range of laws which can be enforced by
who work for local councils. These laws allow consumers to get their money back if goods are found to be faulty or if products do not perform in the way claimed by the manufacturer.
You need to know about the following three pieces of legislation:
This replaced the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Its most important provisions are:
control of monopolies (where a single business has a 25% share of the market or more, and is damaging competition)
control of mergers (where two or more companies join together, which might have adverse effects on competition and the public interest)
control of 'rogue traders' - giving the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) power to take action against businesses that persistently breach civil or criminal law when dealing with consumers
prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods
making the person who manufactures or sells a defective product responsible for damage it causes
allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe goods
prohibiting misleading price indications - eg, giving misleading information about discounts or sale prices
Makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers. This Act makes it an offence for a trader to
apply a false trade description to any goods
supply or offer to supply any goods to which a false trade description has been applied
make certain kinds of false statement about the provision of any services, facilities or accommodation
UK products should be made to safety standards set by both the
. The BSI Kite Mark shows that a product has been made to British standards, while the CE mark shows that a product has been made to EC standards.
When designing your own product, you also need to ensure it will meet safety standards.
Product designers should also take into account
whenever they design or make a product. 'Moral issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on other people. 'Environmental issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on the environment. In practice, since people must live in the environment, it's difficult to separate these things out from each other.
The list below outlines some of the key moral and environmental questions a designer should ask themselves about their product.
Is the cost of the product justifiable?
Does the product make efficient use of natural resources?
Are there any waste products which could pollute the environment?
Can the product be recycled after use?
Having considered the potential moral and environmental impact of a product, a designer may decide to use alternative processes, materials or chemicals. The use of alternatives may mean that some parts of the product need to be re-designed, or an alternative manufacturing process needs to be used.

Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...

5869,"Jane is excited about returning to Thornfield and Mr Rochester, even though she believes he is married to Blanche Ingram. It is obvious when they meet that Rochester is delighted to see her, too.
What follows is ""a fortnight of dubious calm"", in which Jane expects to hear about the marriage but nothing is said.
On midsummer eve, Jane goes into the garden after Adele has gone to bed. She finds Mr Rochester there. The scene is described in extraordinary detail, as it moves to his proposal.
He is perhaps teasing or testing Jane as he talks of her having to move on, claiming to have found her a new position in Ireland. Eventually, however, he proposes, revealing that any chance of a relationship with Blanche ended when he pretended to have less money than she considered acceptable.
Rochester talks frequently of what he is doing as being wrong, but claims his love and care for Jane will atone for it. As readers, we think there could be something sinister behind this. However, Jane does not pick up on more than his emotion as they go into the house.
Jane is blissfully happy, but still aware that Mrs Fairfax seems shocked. So she asks Mr Rochester to speak to her the following day. Her congratulations, when they come, seem very subdued, fuelling our suspicions.
Jane decides she will not abandon her previous path. She refuses expensive gifts and spends a lot of time with Adele. Mr Rochester is eager to be with her, but allows her to dictate terms in this way in the four weeks leading up to the wedding.
Then we hear of a very bizarre episode. Mr Rochester has had to go away. When he returns, Jane describes having been woken by someone in her room. She describes the woman in hideous terms, and explains that her wedding veil was ripped in two, so it could not have been a dream. Mr Rochester encourages her to continue to blame Grace, and insists she shares Adele's room the night before the wedding.
The wedding morning arrives. Mr Rochester is possessed by tension and a desire that everything should be done quickly. Even Jane is encouraged to hurry.
There are no family present at the wedding. Perhaps for this reason, Jane notices two men, apparently waiting for the ceremony, enter the church before them.
When the priest asks if there is any impediment to the marriage, one of the men, Mr Briggs - a lawyer - explains that Rochester is already married to the sister of Mr Mason, who comes forward at this point.
Clearly, there can be no marriage. Mr Rochester takes them back to Thornfield to see his wife, Bertha, a dangerous lunatic, and Grace, her keeper. Bertha attacks Mr Rochester, but he is able to restrain her. Even though
The crime of marrying one person while still being married to another.
is a serious crime, it becomes easy to understand what drove him.
Before Briggs and Mason depart, we learn that it was a chance connection between Jane's uncle in Madeira and Mr Mason that brought Briggs and Mason to stop the marriage. We also learn that Jane's uncle is on his death-bed.
Jane spends a long time numb with shock at what has happened. She eventually meets with Mr Rochester and he tries everything in his power to keep her with him. He explains how he was trapped by his family into the marriage, and how he spent time in Europe seeking, in vain, some kind of escape.
He asks Jane to come away with him, but she is controlled by conscience and cannot allow herself to be loved by a married man. She knows she cannot stay with him and keep her resolution, so says she will leave.

2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.

Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

Thus the method of extraction of a metal from its ore depends on the metal's position in the reactivity series:

Note that gold, because it is so unreactive, is found as the native metal and not as a compound, so it does not need to be chemically separated. However, chemical reactions may be needed to remove other elements that might contaminate the metal.

km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.

To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.

The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.

The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.

Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

The development of railways during the 19th century happened because of the work of three main engineers. We have already mentioned Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson, but Isambard Kingdom Brunel also played a key role.
who designed steam trains, oversaw the construction of new railway tracks and built some amazing and breathtaking bridges and tunnels along his railway routes.
the chief engineer of the Great Western Railway
(GWR) in 1833. The railway line linked the towns of London and Bristol and was often referred to as ""God's Wonderful Railway"" because the route was so smooth and it was a perfect example of railway engineering.
The line was so successful that it was later extended to connect to Plymouth and Cornwall. Brunel used his considerable skills on the route and
built the Tamar Bridge and Box Tunnel
One of the reasons why Brunel's railway routes and tracks were so smooth is because, unlike George Stephenson,
he used a gauge of 7 feet 3 inches
. He believed that this gauge was not only the safest, but would allow trains to travel faster and give the passengers more comfort. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of the railway tracks in Britain had already been built at Stephenson's gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches. This led to
the Gauge Act being passed in 1846
, which stated that all train tracks had to be built to George Stephenson's gauge width. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had

In part, it is to oblige his family by making a good marriage financially speaking. And in part it is because his father and brother, and Bertha's relatives, kept the madness in her family from him. While Rochester blames himself for falling for Bertha's superficial charm, he cannot forgive the betrayal of the deception. Even after his brother and father die, he is still trapped by the situation.
It is clear that he tries to hide from the reality of it, but when he meets Jane he sees her as extraordinarily different and refreshing. He falls deeply in love, but does not have the courage to tell her. He admits, after Mason has stopped the wedding, that he wanted to have her ""safe"" first, knowing her moral stance as he does.

A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six...

We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

War transforms soldiers, breaking them physically and mentally: 'Bent double' 'Knock-kneed'. Rather than glorious men, Owen presents the soldiers as weakened old 'hags'.
The experience of war is something no soldier can escape: 'In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, / He plunges at me'.
The effect of gas used in World War One is communicated to the reader through Owen's use of verbs linked to death by a lack of oxygen: 'guttering, choking, drowning', 'smothering'.
Owen offers the reader very graphic imagery associated with suffering, aiming to present the truth about the war experience, arguably arising from his first-hand experience of war.
Owen presents the soldiers as victims who have been betrayed by those who encouraged them to go to war. He uses words such as 'innocent' and 'children' to reinforce his positive attitude to the soldiers.
Owen is bitter about war and the encouragement given to go to war. He angrily refers to 'The old Lie' that dying for your country is sweet and honourable.
The detailed description of a soldier dying as a result of gas attack is intended to make the reader feel discomfort, forcing him or her to confront the reality of war, something which is far from honourable or sweet.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.
parallel ridges in the earth for growing potatoes

the pole between the handle and the blade

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -
Where a phrase or word is repeated several times to emphasise or make a particular point.
(line 16) suggests not only Heaney's affection for his grandfather, but his father's affection for him too: the love between them bonds the three generations.
Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Central, unifying ideas that run through a text or performance.
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.
.. living roots awaken in my head.
These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

In this way, a dose that might be prohibitively damaging to other parts of the body can be delivered safely to, say, a cancerous tumour.

Make sure you read the title of a map before you start to use it. This will give you a general idea about the information it stores. While it may appear a straight-forward thing to do, under exam conditions, it is easy to confuse different maps or not use the one that is most useful.
The scale of a map allows a reader to calculate the size, height and dimensions of the features shown on the map, as well as distances between different points. The scale on a map is the ratio between real life sizes and how many times it has been shrunk to fit it on the map.
The scale below is for a 1:50,000 scale map. At this scale, 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm on the ground (= 500 metres or 0.5 kilometres).
maps, the most common type of map in the UK, come in several scales.
Travel maps have a scale of 1:125,000. This means 1cm on the map represents 125,000 in the real world or 1 cm = 1.25km. These are used by drivers going long distances.
Landranger maps are 1:50,000 (1cm = 500m). These are useful for drivers going shorter distances.
Explorer maps are 1:25,000 (1cm = 250m). These are useful for walking and other outdoor pursuits.
Landplan maps are 1:10,000 (1cm = 100m). These show individual streets clearly and might be used by town planners.
You will be asked to interpret maps to find out specific information. Being able to distinguish between different types of land use on an Ordnance Survey (OS) map will help you interpret maps during your exams. Here are some things you should brush up on:
Make sure you can tell the difference between urban and rural land use. Start by looking at the key. Are the features in the key related to the countryside or to towns?
Look out for features of the urban landscape that are represented in symbols on the OS map. Start by looking at modes of transport (eg junctions of main roads, railways, ports and airports).
Look for rural features. Study the key carefully to see what different areas of shading on the map represent. For example, different types of farmland will be shaded differently.
Study the relief of the land on your OS map by looking for the
lines on a map joining points of equal height above sea level - thus representing the slope of the land
. Contours will show you where the hills (elevations) and valleys (depressions) are on the map. Contours will often show changes in height of 5 or 10 meters. The closer the contours are together the steeper the slope is. If the contours are far apart, you might be looking at a flat flood plain. On the map below the contours in square
are quite close together - indicating a fairly steep
Make sure that you know how to interpret different types of map. Read keys and grid references carefully.
When drawing maps be sure to include the following:
- stating what the map shows (eg land use or vegetation cover)

- showing which way is up (North)
- so the reader can translate distances shown on the map into distances on the ground

Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Some knowledge of ancient Egyptian civilisation will help you to understand Egyptian medicine.
The Egyptian civilisation was the first of the great world civilisations, and the
of this society led to important spin-offs into medicine.

, which required temples, priests and rituals that included mummification. Their experience of mummification taught the priests about the workings of the human body, and some members of the priesthood evolved into professional doctors.
Further still, the Egyptians invented the skills of

The ancient Egyptians travelled and traded all over the known world, and brought back all kinds of herbs and spices, which their doctors then used to heal certain diseases. Most of all, they developed a wealthy way of life, which left them time for observation and reflection.
From their observations of the irrigation channels used by farmers to water their crops came an important medical development - the invention of the

Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.

3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.
1. Crop this image to include only the penguin.

2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package.
3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border.
