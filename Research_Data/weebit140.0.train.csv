Because the car uses the sun for power, it does not pollute the air. Special cells are on top of the car. The cells collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. The electricity powers the car's motor.
Each day, the car used the same amount of electricity needed to run a toaster. The team hopes that someday more people will drive solar cars.

In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:

of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers.
San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!
Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out
Experts say the earthquake might have caused
, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore.
Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier.
Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds.
Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour.
Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.
Sea lions eat fish, squid, and octopus. They have about 36 teeth but like to swallow their food whole.

Many animals hibernate (HIGH-behr-nayt) during the winter. When an animal hibernates, it goes into a deep sleep. Animals hibernate when the weather gets cold and it is hard to find food. Animals like frogs, chipmunks, and bears hibernate.
In the fall, brown bears eat a lot of food. They eat berries, plants, and fish. Bears eat to build up fat. By the end of the fall, the bears start to hibernate in dens, which are caves or openings in the ground. They breathe slower and their hearts beat slower. They don't need to eat or drink because they use their fat to stay alive.
When fall comes, a chipmunk gathers extra food. It stores the extra food in its
, or hole in the ground. The chipmunk hibernates in its burrow for the winter. Sometimes, a hibernating chipmunk wakes up. It wakes up to eat some of its stored food. It eats berries, mushrooms, and nuts.

434,"What sounds do you hear right now? You may hear a fan blowing, kids talking, or a bell ringing. All the sounds you hear travel in waves. Those waves enter your outer ear. They travel through your middle ear and inner ear. Your inner ear sends a message to your brain. Then you hear sound. Study the ear below to learn more.
That means it moves quickly back and forth. When people speak, their vocal cords vibrate. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and makes sound.
Did you know that sounds can travel through solid materials? Try this experiment with a partner to find out. Place a plastic ruler on a table. Make sure one end is hanging over the edge. Hold the ruler down with one hand. Ask your partner to place his or her ear against the surface of the table. With your other hand, gently snap the end of the ruler that is hanging over the floor. What did you and your partner see, hear, and feel?

586,"On most days, you may see clouds in the sky. Where do they come from? When the sun heats oceans and lakes, water changes from a liquid to a gas. It rises into the air and cools. As it cools, the gas changes back into a liquid. It forms tiny drops of water or ice crystals. As they come together, they become clouds.
Clouds come in different shapes. Each shape is a clue to the kind of weather that is on the way. Learn about four kinds of clouds.
(SIHR-uhss) clouds are thin and wispy. They look like hairs. They are found high in the sky. Cirrus clouds can bring a change in the weather.
(KYOO-myuh-luhss) clouds are big and fluffy. They may look like cotton balls. They usually form low in the sky. Cumulus clouds often bring sunny, fair weather.
(STRAH-tuhss) clouds are long layers of clouds. They look like a blanket. They are low in the sky. Stratus clouds can bring light rain.
(kyoo-myuh-loh-NIM-buhss) clouds are big and gray. They are a kind of cumulus cloud. They can start near the ground and be very tall in the sky. Cumulonimbus clouds can bring heavy rain and thunderstorms. They also may mean a

Each person in the United States makes about 4 pounds of trash per day! So landfills, or places where people dump trash, are starting to get full. People should reduce, or make smaller, the amount of trash they throw away.
Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. Paper does not easily biodegrade, or break down. But paper is easily recycled, or used again, after going through a special process.
Recycle by taking old newspapers or old homework to a recycling center.
Some trash in landfills could be used for other things! Instead of throwing trash away, people should find more ways to reuse it, or use trash again.
Reuse the top of a pizza box as an easel. Use the bottom part of the box to store your art supplies.

Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A
is a small bird that is usually yellow.
Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.

Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.

Crews bring up a 3,000-pound anchor from the shipwreck.
His name was Edward Teach. People called him Blackbeard. He was a cruel pirate captain with a long black beard. He robbed and hurt people along the eastern coast of North America until 1718. That year, his ship crashed. It sank near North Carolina. Blackbeard got away. He was killed soon after.
When experts found a shipwreck in that area a few years ago, they thought it might be Blackbeards boat. Recently, they

It rests on the ocean floor off the coast of Beaufort, North Carolina.
Researchers found many weapons near and inside the ship. The finds included parts of a sword and many cannons. Blackbeard most likely used the battle gear to
other ships. To seize is to take over.
Blackbeards scary appearance also helped him get what he wanted. During battles, the pirate was said to have put lit matches under his hat. That caused smoke to appear around his beard.
Experts are continuing to study Blackbeards ship. They are collecting

People are destroying the Amazon. Each year, farmers and loggers cut down rain forest trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Scientists have recently discovered that the Amazon is shrinking twice as quickly as they once thought.
The Amazon rain forest is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant
or variety. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines people need come from the Amazon.
The Amazon rain forest also helps recycle Earths air. The trees give off oxygen for people to breathe. Trees also clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans.
Stopping people from destroying the rain forest is not an easy task. ""Almost 2 million people make the forest their home,"" scientist Jim Bowyer told
""All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive. Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

A lagoon is an area of shallow water.
During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water!
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.
Venice is known as the City of Canals.
There are about 150 canals in Venice.
About 400 bridges connect the citys 118 islands.
Why might people want to live in a city that floods?

Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

A mother cheetah rests with her cubs in the tall grass. Their spotted fur helps them stay hidden. The mother cheetah does not know it, but animal experts are tracking her every move.
Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats.
The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs.
The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.
The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.
""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""
Cheetahs can run 65 miles per hour. That is about as fast as a car driving on a highway!
In one second, cheetahs can run about 92 feet.
Cheetahs can run fast for only a short distance about a quarter of a mile.

Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.
Why should people stand up for what they believe in?

To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change.
Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes dont know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes dont have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot.
Thats where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock.
It takes about three months for the birds to reach the Southwith plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special
or protected areas, in Florida. By then, the birds know how to migrate. This spring, birds that flew with the pilots last fall will return to the North on their own.
For Duff, the best part of the trip is bringing whooping cranes to the refuges. Its [a nice feeling] because you know the birds are going to make it, he told
Last fall, pilots in Wisconsin led a flock of whooping cranes across seven states. In Florida, the flock was divided and taken to two refuges. Study the map for a birds-eye view of their trip.

However, it has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Visitors have not been allowed to climb the 354 steps to the crown.
Experts say that it might be difficult for people to make their way down from the statue's crown in an emergency. The group that cares for Lady Liberty is raising money to make the statue safer so it can reopen. Officials have not said whether people will be allowed to climb above the

Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of

asked some third graders at Tamarac Elementary School in Holtsville, New York, that question. Here's what they said:
Jackie Robinson in a Kansas City Monarchs Uniform.
I admire Jackie Robinson. It must have been tough being the first African American to play major-league baseball. He wasn't treated equal. Instead of getting angry, Jackie Robinson showed how good he was. He made the Hall of Fame!
Rosa Parks was a very brave woman. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. She helped change the laws in our country by standing up for what she believed in.
Hockey player Anson Carter is whom I admire. He has proved to be a decent power forward for the New York Rangers. He always gives 100 percent. That will help the Rangers make their drive for the playoffs.

""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told
. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the
together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions.
Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.
Why is learning about different cultures important?

About 1.7 million U.S. residents use bicycles as their

The spike in bikes may be thanks to the work of U.S. cities. From San Francisco to Boston, cities are becoming more bicycle-friendly. Some towns are adding more bike lanes. That makes
easier for cyclists. To commute is to travel regularly from one place to another, such as school or work.

U.S. officials hope the new projects mean people will use their bicycles more and their cars less. Fewer cars on the road can help cut pollution. Thats because driving cars gives off harmful gases.
Riding bicycles helps more than just the environment, though. Cycling is a great way for people to stay active and fit, explains Meghan Cahill. She is a spokesperson for the League of American Bicyclists.

! Youve probably been hearing those sounds a lot. Why?

More than half of Americans are now sensitive to at least one
Thats the finding of one of the most recent surveys by the National Institutes of Health. Allergens are things that set off allergies. Many allergenssuch as dust and moldare found in the air.
Allergies [are] increasing over time, says Andy Nish. He is a doctor from Georgia.
Allergens in the air arent the only problem. Kids food allergies have risen too. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of kids with food allergies jumped 18 percent. Eating milk products and eggs can give some children rashes. Those foods can even cause some people to have trouble breathing.
Whats behind allergies spread? Some scientists think our
dont have enough to do. Immune systems help our bodies fight germs. But kids today come in contact with fewer germs than their grandparents did. Thats in part because more medicine is available. Experts say that when our immune systems have fewer germs to fight, they can get confused. They attack other things, such as milk, instead.
Other scientists say hotter temperatures are to blame. They say the weather is warmer for longer periods now, so plants bloom longer. Plants release pollen (left), which is a common allergen.
Doctors do not know for sure whats making allergies increase. But they do know how to treat them with medicine. There is very good treatment for allergies, Nish says. No one should suffer with symptoms.
Dust and other allergens that float into your nose are in for a blasta cough or a sneeze, that is! Both are natural
, or responses, to help keep you from getting sick. Heres a look at the big bursts.
Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.
What might be some other reasons for the rise in allergies?

What does it take for a tiny seed to turn into a leafy plant? Lets take a look to find out.
 Seeds need water and oxygen to grow. Most seeds grow best between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 After a seed takes in water, a root pushes out from the seed. The root collects water and minerals from the soil.
 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called

You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October.
Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild.
Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo.
""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016.""
Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year.
The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China.
Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design.
The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail.

258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

214,"A ""cat-tastrophe"" recently struck the airport near Providence, Rhode Island. Airport officials were forced to cancel a flight when they found a runaway cat named Muffy sitting in the airplane's wheel well, the place where the landing gear is stored during flight.
The wayward cat had been placed in a cage to be put aboard an airplane. But somehow Muffy escaped and climbed into the wheel well of a nearby plane.
Airport workers spent hours trying to coax the cat down from its hiding place. They even offered Muffy some tasty treats.
Finally, after seven hours, the workers removed panels from the plane's wing and pulled Muffy to safety. Muffy, the runway runaway, was then reunited with her family.

Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.
Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge.
Johnson-Sirleaf vows to unite Liberia and create jobs.
The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce

As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countrys rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer.""
Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberias first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war.
Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs.

Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll.
Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election.

670,"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar systems giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

802,"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea. After World War II (1939-1945), Korea was split in half. In 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea attacked South Korea, The United States helped defend South Korea.

339,"Some experts question rewarding reading with pizza.
Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting
But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company. ""Schools need to realize that they are undermining their students' well-being,"" says nutrition expert Jane Levine. She explains that the Book It program is a problem not just because it rewards kids with fast food but also because it makes a large company a regular part of the school day.

669,"One morning in February, 75,000 kids woke up to find that they had become U.S. citizens. The kids, who were all adopted from other countries, became citizens because of the Child Citizenship Act.
The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

or type, of monkey to be identified in 20 years.
The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

706,"For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two!
Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.

The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

Now, a government committee in Honduras wants parents to stop giving their children such unusual names. The committee worries that some kids could tease those kids with uncommon names. ""Without a doubt,"" the committee said, ""such names are a bother to the people who have to carry them through life.""

A computer glitch was to blame for Simpson's mix-up on
. Simpson, 20, was caught lip-synching when the words to the wrong song began playing.
Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse.
""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do.""
An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts.
Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility.
Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance.

Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.
Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote at
According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their

Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is

350,"Where the Wild Things Are!: A Numbers Puzzle
Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.
The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.
After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest
of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.
The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most
animals. That means there are very few left in the wild.
Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their
, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland.
Giant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.
, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can't store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.
A newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.
Each front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.
Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick
Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day.
In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.
To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.
How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more
for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.
""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too.""
Why is it important for scientists to track endangered animals?

418,"These fourth graders are switching classes like middle schoolers!
Some fourth and fifth graders are on the move. The students at Ottawa Elementary School in Buchanan, Michigan, are getting a sneak preview of middle school life. Theyre switching classesand teachersfour times a day.
So far, the program has been a big hit. ""The kids really like that theyre going to get up and move every 40 minutes,"" science teacher Sue Borr told
""They dont like sitting in the same place all day.""
Borr suggested the program, which is called team teaching. Instead of staying with one teacher all day, students go to four different classrooms, where they learn four different subjects. Those subjects are math, social studies, science, and language arts. The students begin and end the day with a homeroom teacher.
""I like it better because the teachers like what theyre teaching,"" says Ottawa fifth grader Michael Meersman. ""They have fun, and theyre not as grouchy.""
Unlike many elementary school students, these fourth and fifth graders dont leave their papers and supplies in a desk. They carry their work with them from class to class in three-ring binders and colored folders. ""Theyre really organized,"" adds Borr.
Fourth graders at Ottawa have another reason to like the program: They wont have to get used to a new teacher when school starts next September, because they will learn the same subjects from the same teachers.

413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

478,"Snakehead fish and other invasive species threaten the environment.
Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of
that currently threaten environments in the United States.
An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack
in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area.
Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.
Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt

Cigarettes contain many chemicals, including a chemical called nicotine, which studies have proved is addictive.
For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks.
The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction.

Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of

As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

A Pennsylvania man got more than a penny for his thoughts. After 40 years of pinching (or saving) pennies, Lynn Wagner decided it was time to cash them in at the bank.
Wagner collected more than a million pennies in all. Over the years, he stored the pennies in 41 / 2-gallon buckets in his garage. After several bank visits to cash in 37 buckets of coins, Wagner came home with about $10,060 in paper money!
How did he become so penny-wise? ""I thought that it'd be interesting to have a million [pennies],"" he said.

Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""
King Tut and his treasures first visited the United States in the 1970s. That display attracted a whopping 8 million visitors. The new exhibit looks at what life was like for Tut and other
who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British
Howard Carter made one of history's greatest finds. An archaeologist is a person who digs up ancient ruins and studies the past. The long-lost tomb contained Tut's

Although Tut's mask and mummy are too fragile to be removed from Egypt, some of Carter's other fascinating finds are on display in the latest exhibit. ""
"". One of the treasures, a wooden figure of the boy king, is the first object that visitors see when they enter the exhibit. In the darkened room, a light shines on the wooden figure. The figure is depicted without Tut's famous gold or jewels.
""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.

The wealth of objects discovered in the young king's tomb leads scientists to wonder what might have been contained in the tombs of other pharaohs. Those tombs, unlike Tut's, were

590,"Hawaiian monk seals may be headed for extinction.
Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main
or natural home. Longenecker and other researchers think the seals are not getting enough food, and they are desperately trying to figure out why. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

519,"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another.
President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

Nearly 40 percent of elementary schools have either eliminated or are considering eliminating recess, according to the American Association for the Childs Right to Play.
Why? Some school officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They hope that more time in class will help students perform better on standardized tests.
In addition, many schools are cutting recess because they can no longer afford to offer it. Those schools dont have the money to hire lunch aides or to buy sports equipment for the playground.
Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).

745,"William Jefferson Clinton is the 42nd president of the United States. He has been the president since 1993. He will leave office when the next president takes the oath of office on January 20, 2001. Recently, Bill Clinton answered questions from
What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

658,"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years.
The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

798,"One night in March, Daniel Calderone, age 12, was doing his homework in his California home. Then the lights went out, and he knew he wouldn't finish his assignment.
Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.
After the danger from the wildfire passed, firefighters used water to wash the slime away.

Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily. The Army told Hershey the bars should taste ""just a little better than a boiled potato,"" so that soldiers wouldn't eat too many of them.

361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

fly among the forest. Emerald tree boas curl up on branches to stalk prey. Endangered jaguars slink through the thick brush in search of food. These are just a few of the thousands of animals that call the Amazon rain forest home.
A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at

That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in

Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to

Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!
What are some other ways you can protect natural resources?

Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated.
Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales.
The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:
Carry a lunch box instead of a paper lunch bag, and pack food in reusable containers.

779,"Is Atlantis a myth? For centuries, people have wondered whether this legendary land really existed. A
is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.

Plato wrote about Atlantis as an island in the western sea. Many people believe that location meant the Atlantic Ocean.

A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.

As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

95,"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""
Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!

The plastic toys floated along Alaska's coast and through the Bering Strait. Bobbing past polar bears and seals, the toys were caught in ice around the North Pole for several years.
They eventually made their way into the North Atlantic Ocean. Some washed up in Iceland. According to oceanographers, the ducks are now due to waddle ashore in New England and Canada.
The ducks' voyage is teaching oceanographers some lessons about currents, including how trash and ocean pollution travel. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said the oceanographer tracking the ducks. ""It just goes somewhere else.""

Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?

404,"It was a clear evening on July 23 as James Mennig stood outside his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As he looked up into the sky, Mennig saw something that caused him to turn and run inside.
Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said.
The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere.
A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars.
According to officials at the U.S. Department of Defense, the bright meteor, which is called a fireball, entered Earth's atmosphere above Scranton, Pa. People from Canada to Virginia saw the bright fireball.
Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield.
According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth.
Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise.
""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa.
*Meteors come from pieces of space debris called meteoroids. Meteoroids can be made of rock, metal, or both.
*A meteor is a piece of rock or metal that breaks away from a meteoroid and enters Earth's atmosphere.

128,"More than 1,000 years ago, the Maya lived in part of what is now Central America and southern Mexico. They built huge pyramids and large temples. They studied astronomy and developed a calendar. Then for unknown reasons, the Maya disappeared.
Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called
, which are a kind of picture writing.
Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.

41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.

We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it.

266,"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?
have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

205,"You've probably sat at a desk or on a bench on which someone had carved or scratched a message. Etching, or carving, messages is nothing new, however. People have been carving and painting messages on rock walls for thousands of years.
Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old.
The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling.
Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

691,"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans.
Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly

The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.

How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.
Under pressure? See what happens when you cool down.

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14
3 weeks is 3  7 days = 21
4 weeks is 4  7 days = 28
So, the formula to work out the number of days is:

means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this.
means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.

The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14  6  6 = 113.04cm
b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14  5  5 = 78.5cm

By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use
The area of the materials required is 10990mm
Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14  20  20 = 1256cm
The area of the small circle is 3.14  1  1 = 3.14cm
Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

The Tempest second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

224,"A food chain shows the different organisms that live in a habitat, and what eats what.
A food chain always starts with a producer, which is an organism that makes food. This is usually a green plant, because plants can make their own food by photosynthesis.
A food chain ends with a consumer, which is an animal that eats a plant or another animal. Here is an example of a simple food chain:
Take care - the arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. If you get the arrows the wrong way round, instead of showing that humans eat cows, you are showing that cows eat humans, and that grass eats cows.
There are several words used to describe the organisms in a food chain. Study this food chain:
The plant is the producer and the animals are consumers.
Notice that the first consumer in the chain is also called the primary consumer, the next one is the secondary consumer and the one after that is the tertiary consumer.

You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made

Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.
None of them are good listeners and anyway, they shouldn't be chatting in class.

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are
and do not break down. Instead, they accumulate in the food chain and damage the organisms in it, especially the top predators.
Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks.

441,"We can see why variety is important by looking at this list below. It is taken from a story called ""You are now entering the human heart"", by Janet Frame, and is actually one of her paragraphs broken down into simple sentences:
None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.
It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book.
Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied.
So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.
Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do.
Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers.

It is important to balance the amount of food we eat with who we are and what we do. The amount of energy we need from our food depends on our age, our height and how much exercise we get.
For example, a one-year old baby needs 3850 kJ each day to continue to grow, whereas an adult Olympic swimmer in training needs 15,600 kJ each day. Someone who sits at a desk all day will need less food than their twin who climbs ladders all day to wash windows.

Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.

A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.

Red Mount Chapel is on a mound on ""The Walks"" in the park.
Red Mount Chapel is a superb example of the Gothic style in architecture and even boasts its own musical ghost!
Built in 1485 at the time of Henry VII, the first Tudor king, it was a stopping-off place for pilgrims on their way to Walsingham via the port of King's Lynn. Octagonal in shape, it is very small, and had three floors. The top floor is a chapel with fan tracery much like that in Cambridge's King's College.
Underneath the chapel building there is reputed to be a long tunnel (not unusual), running to Castle Rising - a distance of 18km/12 miles (very unusual). An unfortunate, drunken fiddler once decided to explore the dark passageway with his instrument, his dog and his pint! He never reached the end of the tunnel, wherever it went, but his spirit remains and can be heard on occasions playing his tunes and singing, accompanied by the whining of his poor dog!

Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.
The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is 30. We say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of 030 from Heathrow Airport.

Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.
As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"".

The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it

If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the

Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.

For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

497,"> Atmosphere and setting - Implicit meaning
- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

2626,"Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division - Foundation
For your exam, you will need to feel confident when dealing with fractions. This section will help you to recognise equivalent fractions and practise simple calculations.
It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.
To multiply fractions, you need to multiply the top numbers together, and multiply the bottom numbers together. Remember that you cannot cancel numbers that are both on the top of a fraction. Have a look at the example below.
OR cancel between the top and the bottom then multiply:
The 5s do not cancel because they are both on the top of the fraction.

1066,"Fold mountains occur near convergent or compressional plate boundaries. Examples of fold mountains include the Alps, Rockies, Andes and Himalayas.
Where an area of sea separates two plates, sediments settle on the sea floor in depressions called geosynclines. These sediments gradually become compressed into sedimentary rock.
When the two plates move towards each other again, the layers of sedimentary rock on the sea floor become crumpled and folded.
Eventually the sedimentary rock appears above sea level as a range of fold mountains.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:

2494,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

5070,"To read a map you need to understand compass directions, grid references and the map's key and scale. You need to be able to find features when given a map reference. You also need to be able to describe a feature's location on a map by giving a map reference. From a map you should be able to pick out key information on natural features and types of human activity (eg, is this an rural or urban location?)
Maps are representations of the world. Maps are written by people called
the world. Maps contain information tailored to a specific purpose.

will contain information of less interest to a road user, such as how the land in a place is used, the population density and the political boundaries that exist between regions, states and nations.
There are five fundamental things you need to be familiar with to read a map successfully:
Compass directions are vital for finding your way around a map. There are many ways to remember where each direction goes. You probably learnt a rhyme or a phrase to help you remember - if not, here's one now. Starting at the top and moving clockwise the directions on a compass or map are:

Make sure you read the title of a map before you start to use it. This will give you a general idea about the information it stores. While it may appear a straight-forward thing to do, under exam conditions, it is easy to confuse different maps or not use the one that is most useful.
The scale of a map allows a reader to calculate the size, height and dimensions of the features shown on the map, as well as distances between different points. The scale on a map is the ratio between real life sizes and how many times it has been shrunk to fit it on the map.
The scale below is for a 1:50,000 scale map. At this scale, 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm on the ground (= 500 metres or 0.5 kilometres).
maps, the most common type of map in the UK, come in several scales.
Travel maps have a scale of 1:125,000. This means 1cm on the map represents 125,000 in the real world or 1 cm = 1.25km. These are used by drivers going long distances.
Landranger maps are 1:50,000 (1cm = 500m). These are useful for drivers going shorter distances.
Explorer maps are 1:25,000 (1cm = 250m). These are useful for walking and other outdoor pursuits.
Landplan maps are 1:10,000 (1cm = 100m). These show individual streets clearly and might be used by town planners.
You will be asked to interpret maps to find out specific information. Being able to distinguish between different types of land use on an Ordnance Survey (OS) map will help you interpret maps during your exams. Here are some things you should brush up on:
Make sure you can tell the difference between urban and rural land use. Start by looking at the key. Are the features in the key related to the countryside or to towns?
Look out for features of the urban landscape that are represented in symbols on the OS map. Start by looking at modes of transport (eg junctions of main roads, railways, ports and airports).
Look for rural features. Study the key carefully to see what different areas of shading on the map represent. For example, different types of farmland will be shaded differently.
Study the relief of the land on your OS map by looking for the
lines on a map joining points of equal height above sea level - thus representing the slope of the land
. Contours will show you where the hills (elevations) and valleys (depressions) are on the map. Contours will often show changes in height of 5 or 10 meters. The closer the contours are together the steeper the slope is. If the contours are far apart, you might be looking at a flat flood plain. On the map below the contours in square
are quite close together - indicating a fairly steep
Make sure that you know how to interpret different types of map. Read keys and grid references carefully.
When drawing maps be sure to include the following:
- stating what the map shows (eg land use or vegetation cover)
- so the reader knows what the symbols on the map represent
- showing which way is up (North)
- so the reader can translate distances shown on the map into distances on the ground
: In the case of map skills the internet is
. The best way to practise map skills is to use real OS maps. If possible look at a number of different types of map - this will help you identify urban and rural landscapes, different human activities and human influences on the landscape. It will also help you to spot the different natural and physical geographical processes that have taken place - the processes that you learnt about in the sections on rivers, coasts and glaciation.

Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.

We are not told specifically why she was beaten - perhaps her parents were angry with her for the trouble she had caused, or found that hitting her was a way of venting the anxiety they had when they realised she was missing.

Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...
This phrase suggests respect for Batman's skills.

His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

The second stanza is full of colour. The jacket is canary-yellow (line 5) and becomes blackened (line 7). The child see[s] red - Armitage chose a phrase that uses colour to depict anger - and Blue murder is threatened. Yellow, red and blue are the primary colours: perhaps Armitage used these to show how vivid and 'colourful' the child's memories of the row are - it is obviously still important to him many years later.
The mother is described as the very model of a model of a mother (line 8). Does this suggest that she is a typical mother figure (as if like a child's model toy, reproduced in a factory) or a more-than-perfect mother (model as an adjective can mean 'ideally perfect')? Either way, she makes the wrong assumption about how the jacket got dirty - in the child's eyes, as least.
It is midnight when the child escapes to the phone box - always a time when special things may happen! This call seems to have been a symbolic attempt to get in touch with his future adult self.
The father figure (line 17) is in silhouette: the child can see his shape, but not his whole body. Does this suggest that their relationship with him is not now as 'rounded' as a result of the row? It is not definite that he is the child's actual father - only a father figure. The fact that he is waiting outside shows that he is concerned for the welfare of the child, but also that he wants to set things straight (line 17) - perhaps implying that the argument is not over yet!
The final stanza is an extended metaphor. The embrace between the child and the family is likened to putting on the yellow jacket that caused the row in the first place. Parts of the body become parts of the jacket, to show us how warm and loving the hug is. The poet does not know exactly what the jacket looks like -
""these fingers make a zip / or buckle, you say which""
(line 20), but it does not matter as
(line 23). In other words, continuity is restored, the family is whole again.
We can 'hear' some of the family row. Stanza two has many short phrases, showing tension rising in the household. Armitage uses
that the child and the mother may actually have spoken.
(line 11) could be the order of a furious parent: we can imagine their finger pointing towards the door!

5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).

6438,"Despite efforts to 'turn metric', it is obvious that there are still many imperial units in use today. For example do you know your height in
? It is therefore helpful to know how to convert between the two.
Converting from one metric unit to another
Perhaps the most common metric conversions are between mm, cm, m and km.
1 m = 100 cm = 1000 mm
1 km = 1000 m = 100 000 cm = 1 000 000 mm
, so 1 km = 1000 m
Once you are confident with conversions between mm, cm, m and km, converting units of mass and capacity is eaier.
1 km = 1000 m, so 1 kg = 1000 g
1 m = 100 cm, so 1 l (litre) = 100 cl (centilitres)
1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 g = 1000 mg (milligrams)
A packet of biscuits weighs 150 g. Find the weight of 12 packets of biscuits:
12  150 = 1800, so 12 packets of biscuits weigh 1800g.
Remember that 1 kg = 1000 g. To convert from g to kg, we divide by 1000.

A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:

1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.

When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep

My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -

Heaney does not explain exactly why he has

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.

Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.

These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?

Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

One way to reduce the air pollution caused by power stations is to

Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.
. The amount of sulfur dioxide given off by a power station can be reduced by:
removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:

After seeing a photograph of her, Birling admits that she used to be one of his employees: he discharged her when she became one of the ring-leaders of a strike asking for slightly higher wages. Birling justifies sacking her by saying he paid his workers the usual rates; he cannot see that he has any responsibility for what happened to her afterwards.

3815,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Roman ideas about disease were muddled. For example:
Crinas of Massilia thought illness was caused by the stars (astrology).
Varro blamed creatures too tiny to be seen.
Columella blamed poisonous vapours in the swamps.
All these ideas survived until the 19th century.
Galen based most of his information about anatomy on what he saw when he dissected the bodies of animals. This led him to make mistakes. Some of his errors were:
He thought that muscles attach to the bone in the same way in humans and in dogs.
He thought that blood was created in the liver. He realised that it flowed round the body, but said it was burned up as fuel for the muscles.
He thought he saw holes through the septum, which allowed the blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other.
He made mistakes about the blood vessels in the brain.
He thought the human jaw-bone was made up of two bones, like a dog's.
He was mistaken about the shape of the human liver.

Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the

Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

1263,"Despite some MEDCs having food surpluses and problems such as obesity, many people in LEDCs suffer from malnutrition and starvation. This could be a result of factors such as drought, debt or conflict, eg in the Darfur region of Sudan.
This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

707,"Line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams
For the exam, you will need to know how to draw and interpret statistical diagrams including two way tables, line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams.
Below is an example of a two-way table showing the number of boys and girls in a 6th form college:
We can find out lots of information from this table, for example:
There are 260 girls in the college (120 + 140)
of the boys are in U6 (100 out of 240)
48% of the pupils are boys (
If a girl is chosen at random, the probability that she is in class L6 is

If a boy is chosen at random, what is the probability that he is in U6?
There are 260 pupils in L6 (140 boys and 120 girls)
Line graphs are made by joining up points plotted on a graph.
This table shows a country's grape production (in thousands ['000s] of tonnes) for the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990.
This data can be represented in the form of a line graph as shown below.
Frequency polygons can be used to represent grouped data.
Fifty bags of sweets were opened. The number of sweets in each bag is recorded in the table below:
Represent this information in the form of a frequency polygon.
The frequency polygon is plotted at the
A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below:
This data can be more easily interpreted if we represent it in a
This stem and leaf diagram shows the data above:
The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case, tens and units.
The tens form the stem and the units form the leaves.
This information is given to us in the
It is usual for the numbers to be ordered. So, for example, the row
shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25 and 27 in order.
From the stem and leaf diagram how many children scored more than 40?
6 people had a score of more than 40
To find this look down the ""stem"" to the the column labelled 4, and don't forget to include the child who scored 50!
As well as providing valuable evidence to support your finding, statistics can be misleading. They are often used to prove a point, and can easily be twisted in favour of that point.
Here are some examples of misleading graphs.
What is wrong with this bar chart? How should the information be represented?
From this graph, it looks as though house prices have trebled in one year! It is misleading because the vertical axis does not start at 0. Look at the 'improved' version of the same graph. This gives a much more accurate picture of what has happened.
Although the vertical scale starts at 0, it does not go up in even steps. This distorts the graph, and makes it look as though the biggest jump is between 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4.
Also, there are no labels on the axes, so we have no idea what this graph represents!
What is wrong with this 3D bar chart?
This 3D bar chart might look very attractive, but it is also very misleading. There is no scale on the vertical axis and, because of the perspective, it looks as though sales for 1995 were far greater than those for any other year. In fact, they were identical to those in 1997.
The data would be better represented on a 2D-bar chart, with appropriate labelling on each axis:
What is wrong with this pictogram showing the number of people who own different types of pets?
On this pictogram, there is no category for people who do not own a pet. The pictures are different sizes, and it appears that more people own a horse than any other animal.
An improvement would be to redraw the pictogram, with each of the animals the same size and aligned with one another like this:

Loyalty cards provide companies with information about customer spending habits. This information can be used to target customers generally or specifically.
If customers frequently buy bread and milk together, these items may be put nearby each other for customer convenience or, farther apart forcing the customer to walk through the entire store (in the hope they buy additional items along their way).
If a customer frequently buys beans, vouchers offering money off beans will be sent to them (further increasing their loyalty), rather than for products they rarely buy.

When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).

for resources. Before the beginning of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, small groups of humans wandered across large areas, hunting and gathering just enough food to stay alive. Population numbers were kept low because of the difficulty of finding food.
The development of agriculture led to a population explosion that has accelerated enormously during the past 500 years. Unlike other species, humans can
Human population growth over the past 10,000 years
People in the developed world enjoy a high standard of living, with abundant food, cars and comfortable housing. People in the developing world have a lower standard of living, but many countries are catching up quickly.
The worlds human population has passed 6 billion and continues to increase. The growth in the human population and the increase in the standard of living are putting strains on the global environment. Here are some of the ways in which this is happening:
non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are being used up rapidly
raw materials are being used up rapidly
A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even common household items can contain
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.

Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.

greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming
depletes ozone in the upper atmosphere, so damages the ozone layer
Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air
In places where no lichens are growing, it's often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.
Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.
Here are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:
changes to the environment, such as a change in climate
since life on Earth began. Extinction is still happening and a lot of it occurs because of human activities. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and we are very successful predators.

The panda and gorilla are endangered, and may become extinct. Some species in Britain are endangered, too, including the red kite, red squirrel and osprey. They could be helped by measures such as:
legal protection and protection of their habitats
making artificial ecosystems for them to live in
These measures are difficult to implement when dealing with certain organisms, such as whales. These animals live in international waters, so international laws and agreements are needed to protect them.
Fish are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a worldwide average 15% of humans' protein intake. Most of these fish are caught wild, and if fish are caught at a faster rate than the remaining fish can reproduce, the stock of fish will obviously decline. Trying to harvest more fish than the sea can produce is an example of
an activity which uses up resources or damages the environment so that it cannot be continued in the future
Since the 1960s North Sea cod have been overfished, as more and more - and bigger - fishing boats caught more and more cod. At first, catches continued to increase each year. But then - surprise, surprise! - they started to decline, as there were not enough breeding fish left to maintain the cod population. Today, North Sea cod are in danger of extinction.
Humans have now been cutting down trees for around 10,000 years - for wood to burn or build with, or to clear land for farming.

It is also home to an estimated 50% of all species on Earth - once lost, the original habitats can never be replaced. Tropical rainforest is being cut down at the rate of 17 - 20 million hectares a year.
Humans reduce the amount of land and resources available for plants and animals. This happens because of farming, quarrying, dumping waste and building.
Urbanisation means the growth of cities. About

There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.

He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.

Joining wood 1: screws, nails, glues and knock-downs
There are many different ways of making joints in wood. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength required and the quality of the product.

Nails come in different shapes and sizes. Nails are much cheaper than screws and quick to put in. You do not need to drill holes in the wood first, except sometimes when using hard wood or to prevent the wood splitting.
When using wood glue, make sure you:
Get the surfaces to be glued to fit well - no gaps!
Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.
Get everything ready before you start - glue, brush, damp cloth, clamps and blocks to protect your work.

Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.

That is why Jekyll cannot confide in him about what is happening, even though they are old friends. It is also why, throughout the novel, Stevenson makes Utterson come to all the wrong conclusions. The law blinds him to the truth. It is because Utterson is a lawyer that he constantly suspects Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll or has some other criminal purpose.
The ultimate failure of Utterson (and therefore the law) is built into the

Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.

Prayers are said for the dead person:

Between 1793 and 1815 Great Britain went to war with France. British farmers experienced a time of
during the war because French wheat was no longer imported into Britain. This was because Napoleon was attempting to starve the country by stopping (blockading) ships delivering wheat to Britain.
Britain had not been able to grow enough food to feed the growing population under the open-field system. From 1750 onwards, the country had been forced to rely on
mainly from France to feed the population.
During the French Wars, the price of bread in Britain rose because there was not enough wheat coming from abroad.
made landowners and tenant farmers realise that if they could change their farming methods and grow more food, then they would be able to sell more wheat and make more profits.
During the French war, Britain relied on home-grown wheat
Effects of the French Wars on agriculture
The French Wars had social, economic and political effects on British agriculture:
- the British population almost doubled during the French Wars and this created a higher demand for food. During the war years, early wheat yields could not satisfy British demand and farmers had to change their farming methods to make a profit.
- landowners were certain that the more grain they produced, then the more profit they would make. They borrowed money from banks to improve their land and used new techniques, which increased their crop yields. Farmers paid high interest rates to get loans, but their profit made it worthwhile. The amount of British grain produced increased by 40 per cent during the French Wars.
- during the French Wars, the price of British bread rose much faster than wage increases. Rising food prices and the loss of common land caused by enclosures left squatters and labourers with hardly any food to survive on.
Remember - the French Wars made British landowners and tenant farmers very rich, but when the war ended, they became very worried that cheap grain exports would start to arrive from France once again. This would cost them money.
To help remember the effects of the French Wars try to sort them into the social, economic and political ways that they affected different areas of Britain:

However, the other characters are not aware of it and it's as if the speaker is confessing. So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.
- Othello hides away to hear Cassio talk, Iago hides to watch Roderigo's attack on Cassio and even Desdemona's body is hidden until Emilia 'draws the bed-curtain' to reveal her lying there.
- it seems completely unimportant at first, it is just a handkerchief which Desdemona has dropped. But we soon realise that Iago has been trying to get hold of it for a long time, and it is a
of loyalty, so losing it means Desdemona is unfaithful. Othello even thinks it has magical properties. This shows how Shakespeare cleverly takes an ordinary object and makes it the focus of the drama.

Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.

If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 2, Scene 1 (which finishes with Macbeth killing Duncan). You would probably want to include details from the plot like:
How Macbeth and his wife have secretly agreed to kill Duncan
How trouble is predicted at the start of the act (with Banquo saying he can't sleep and having 'cursed thoughts')
How Macbeth greets Banquo as a 'friend' when he is really a traitor
How Macbeth denies he has been thinking of the witches and their predictions (so we already know he is a liar)
How leaving Macbeth alone puts the focus directly on him and his thoughts
How Macbeth is relying on his wife for the signal to kill Duncan (just as he relied upon her for the courage to kill him)

: A small high-pitched double-headed drum used to play solo cues such as call and response.
: A shaker that plays notes throughout the piece/performance.
: A whistle used by the leader to signal an instruction to the group. For example: Start the piece, tamborim and agogo start a new rhythm, silent bar, solo improvisation etc.
: A large bass drum that is hit with soft beaters. They keep a steady pulse and alternate between higher and lower pitches to keep everyone in time. They are divided into 2 groups: high and low.
: A scraper, which plays the same time values as the chocolo.
: A small-headed drum with a single drumhead. The player can press and tighten the skin or dampen the sound while playing. Played with a drumstick and plays more complicated rhythms than the surdo or chocolo.
: A cowbell with 2 pitches, high and low. Held by the left hand and is hit with a drumstick. Notes can be dampened by the left hand to stop them ringing. Plays quite complicated rhythms.
: A snare drum that is played with one hand facing upwards and the other in a loose closed hold facing downwards.

6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

4317,"Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
