6412,"Partnerships are businesses owned by two or more people. A contract called a deed of partnership is normally drawn up. This states the type of partnership it is, how much capital each party has contributed, and how profits and losses will be shared. Doctors, dentists and solicitors are typical examples of professionals who may go into partnership together. They can benefit from shared expertise, but like the sole trader, have unlimited liability. A partnership can also have a

, where one partner's strengths can complement another's. For example, if a hairdresser were in partnership with someone with a business background, one could concentrate on providing the salon service, and the other on handling the finances.
More people are also contributing capital, which allows for more flexibility in running the business.
There is less time pressure on individual partners.
There is someone to consult over business decisions
The main disadvantage of a partnership comes from shared responsibility.
Disputes can arise over decisions that have to be made, or about the effort one partner is putting into the firm compared with another.
The distribution of profits can cause problems. The deed of partnership sets out who should get what, but if one partner feels another is not doing enough, there can be dissatisfaction.
A partnership, like a sole trader, has

She is excited at the prospect, but Eddie is worried: he doesn't want her mixing with strangers, wants her to finish her education and is concerned for her safety. Beatrice takes Catherine's side, however, so in the end Eddie relents and allows Catherine to take the job.
Because the cousins are illegal immigrants, Eddie reminds Beatrice and Catherine not to mention them outside the house. To reinforce the danger, Eddie tells the story of Vinny Bolzano, who let on to the Immigration authorities that his family were hiding an uncle - and the bloody consequences.

Boulder clay can be found in areas of the UK such as Lincolnshire and East Anglia. It is easily eroded, and is one reason why the Holderness coast is so vulnerable to wave attack.
Unlike river deposits that are often sorted into different sizes, all glacial deposits are angular and mixed up (unsorted). The extreme of this can be seen in

A group of drumlins is called a drumlin swarm or a basket of eggs, eg Vale of Eden. These would have been part of the debris that was carried along and then accumulated under the ancient glacier. The long axis of the drumlin indicates the direction in which the glacier was moving. The drumlin would have been deposited when the glacier became overloaded with sediment. However glaciologists still disagree as to exactly how they were formed.

Gerard Manley Hopkins was born in 1844, the eldest of nine children, and quickly proved himself to be highly gifted. He won a scholarship to Oxford, where he earned a double-first class honours degree.
He was a committed Christian and became a Jesuit priest, but became exhausted after working in several parishes all over Britain. When Hopkins was 40, he was appointed professor of Greek and Latin at University College, Dublin.
He loved writing, but found it hard to be a poet and serve God at the same time: when he first became a priest he stopped writing and destroyed his earlier work. Hopkins was inspired to start again in 1875 when he heard about the terrible shipwreck which inspired his great poem
. Thereafter, he produced quite a large body of uniquely individual work.
Hopkins' poetry was neither appreciated or published in his lifetime. A Jesuit magazine to which he submitted some of his poems turned them down. And only a handful of friends who read his work gave him any encouragement. He died of typhoid in 1889, aged 45.
His poems were often in praise of God, celebrating God's glory through His works. He believed that God's goodness could be seen through the natural world.
He was a priest for a short while in Glasgow in 1881, so it was perhaps then that he travelled in Scotland and saw (and sketched) the stream which inspired this poem. Inversnaid is in the Scottish Highlands, overlooking Loch Lomond.

Her father has died and she idealises her Uncle Frank. Superman and Uncle Frank are bound together in her mind.
Gradually, she becomes affected by the war. She is physically sick when she sees graphic pictures of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps. Superman cannot save her from her nightmares.
She is at first powerless when accused by Paula Brown, then becomes isolated and a target. Everyone turns against her.
After this, her usual comforts of home and Uncle Frank do not help, although she pretends she is fine.
When her mother and Uncle Frank appear not to believe her story, she leaves the light room and chooses somewhere dark to hide and think.
This shows how everything has changed for her. She has lost her childhood world of innocence (light) and entered the cruel, dark 'real' world.

An ICT system is a set-up consisting of hardware, software, data and the people who use them. It commonly includes communications technology, such as the Internet.

This is why your GCSE is not just about computers but about how, why and when people use them. It is the power of computers and communications that has allowed ICT systems to become so important. Like any piece of equipment, the important thing about it is what it lets us do.
ICT Systems are used in a number of environments, such as:

What comes out of an ICT system is largely dependant on what you put into the system to begin with.
ICT systems work by taking inputs (instructions and

), processing them and producing outputs that are stored or communicated in some way. The higher the quality and better thought-out the inputs, the more useful the outputs.
ICT systems cannot function properly if the inputs are inaccurate or faulty; they will either not be able to process the data at all, or will output data which is erroneous or useless.

A good example is a system set-up to control water temperature in a tropical fish tank. The temperature of the water is taken as an input from
an automatic input device that continuously monitors a set of computer controlled parameters, eg a parking sensor detects how close a vehicle is to the nearest object and alerts the driver if the distance falls outside of the specified parameters
. Processing takes place and the temperature of the water is compared against the pre-programmed parameters, eg maximum/minimum temperature. The outputs include the automatic decision to either turn on or off the heater to warm or let the water cool. The output, ie the change in the water's temperature, is then fed back by the sensors as an input and the process repeats itself.

It must not be kept longer than is necessary for the registered purpose. It is alright to keep information for certain lengths of time but not indefinitely. This rule means that it would be wrong to keep information about past customers longer than a few years at most.
The information must be kept safe and secure. This includes keeping the information backed up and away from any unauthorised access. It would be wrong to leave personal data open to be viewed by just anyone.
The files may not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (that's the EU plus some small European countries) unless the country that the data is being sent to has a suitable data protection law. This part of the

520,"An electronics product can be thought of as a
with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.
There are four basic types of production system used in electronics - each one using different types of machine and with different levels of automation. Which system is used depends generally on how many identical products are to be produced, and how continuous the production is to be.
This is used to produce very small amounts or specialised electronic products. This might mean producing a single piece of switch gear for a factory machine. Workers in this type of industry need to be highly skilled in a range of different areas and able to work on a number of aspects of the project.
This is the most common type of production in the electronics industry. It involves making a set number of exactly the same product. Some batches will be small, others could be thousands. Batch production might be used to make PCBs for aircraft controls, for example, or control panels for central-heating boilers.In batch production the operation is sub-divided into a number of separate stages, with each stage being completed by different (often computer-controlled) machines. The stages in an PCB batch production process might be:
checking the board, and mounting it into the product
Printed circuit board being checked after manufacture
This is used when very many identical products are required, such as electronic circuits for cars, washing machines and fridges. The products are assembled as they flow along a production line. The operators tend to be semi-skilled.
In-line production plants are very expensive to set up and thousands of products have to be sold to off-set the capital costs. Production is often difficult to plan and breakdowns are costly.
This is where production is heavily automated and runs 24 hours per day. Continuous-flow production is used in oil refining and chemical processing. A considerable amount of electronic control is used in the running and monitoring of these plants.
CAM is essentially the use of automated machines that are controlled by computers. Some of the advantages of using computer-aided manufacturing are that
machines can be quickly reprogrammed for each new batch of products
specifications can be transmitted quickly from design to manufacturing, and from one machine to another
machines can work continuously for long periods
work can be carried out in conditions which would be hazardous to humans
When computers are used to carry out bespoke precision tasks, such as soldering circuit boards, this is called
or CNC. CNC machines can be programmed and operated from computers or other microprocessor systems - either directly using a keyboard or keypad, or indirectly by means of disks, smart cards or other removable media.
In electronics CNC machines are used - among other applications - to 'populate' PCBs and solder the components in place.

2453,"With the election of 1936 looming and
still a major problem Roosevelt introduced more
in the second New Deal. He wanted to further reform America and improve people's lives.
Although Roosevelt restored hope and staved off the collapse of the banking system, the problem of unemployment was more difficult and at the start of 1934 there was still 11.3 million people out of work. Some historians have said that failing to deal with unemployment was the biggest weakness of the New Deal. Criticism of Roosevelt emerged from several directions.
With this criticism in mind and the 1936 presidential election on the horizon, the New Deal began to change direction. Some historians have interpreted the change by saying there were two New Deals - the first dealing with the immediate emergency of 1933-34 and the second, which emerged in 1935-1936, offering more radical, reforming policies:
- this agency employed people to build schools, hospitals and other public buildings.
- this agency aimed to bring electricity to America's farms.
(Wagner Act) - this act aimed to improve relations between workers and employers, especially as 1934 had seen a series of violent industrial disputes.
Some historians say that, where the first New Deal aimed to save America and its capitalist economic system, the second New Deal aimed to change America.
The wealthy businessmen behind the American Liberty League argued that by increasing taxation and encouraging the development of the trade union movement, Roosevelt had
his own class (Roosevelt was from a very wealthy family).
began writing letters saying things like this one from a man in California -
""you are multi-millionaires, what do you care for the masses of the people?""
- the Governor of Louisiana, known as The Kingfish, launched the Share our Wealth campaign in which personal fortunes of more than $3 million would be redistributed to ordinary citizens.
- a Canadian priest - broadcast popular sermons on the CBS network, promising to nationalise the banks.
planned to boost the economy by raising pensions for the over 60s - in return, they would spend $200 a month to increase demand for consumer goods.
Cartoon titled 'The Illegal Act' - caption reads: 'I'm sorry, but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again'
Does Source A criticise or support the New Deal?
At first glance, the cartoon could be mistaken for criticising Roosevelt and the New Deal. It looks like Roosevelt is rescuing another person from the sea of Depression and pulling him into his National Recovery boat. Many New Deal critics were opposed to the cost of the New Deal to the American taxpayer.
However, the cartoon is actually criticising the US Supreme Court - the caption gives it away - Roosevelt is saying: ""I'm sorry but the Supreme Court says I must chuck you back again"", and he is shown to be pushing the man's head down. This is because the Supreme Court did not agree with many of Roosevelt's New Deal proposals and, therefore, did not pass them.
This cartoon sympathises with Roosevelt as it shows him unwillingly pushing away the man who needs saving.

He seems to throw his energies into
At the end of the play, he has not changed. He has not gained a new sense of social responsibility, which is why Sheila (who has) is unsure whether to take back the engagement ring.

5639,"To put Much Ado About Nothing into perspective, you will need to know a little bit about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed.
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son, and probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11).
Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write, or when he entered the theatre. But we know he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular, and later, when King James I granted it the right to perform at his court, became known as 'The King's Men'.
Shakespeare wrote more than 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country. He often wrote parts for particular actors, too.
He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.

, most of it falls as snow.
This biome is found between 50 and 60 degrees north of the equator and is characterised by evergreen coniferous trees with needles instead of leaves. It is also known as Taiga.
Typical trees include spruce, pine and fir. Animals commonly found in the region are reindeer, voles and hares.
At the most northern extent, summer temperatures rarely rise above 10C. As you move further north, trees are shorter and less dense because of the shorter growing season. Winter temperatures can fall as low as minus 30C. At its southern margins, the trees become taller and denser and merge with deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves). Temperatures here can rise as high as 20 degrees in the summer can fall to minus 15 degrees in winter. Precipitation is 300  900mm, and most falls as snow in winter.
Coniferous trees have thick bark to protect against the cold. They are cone shaped, with flexible branches which help them to cope with heavy snow fall.
Pine cones protect the seeds during the harsh winter.
The thin waxy needles reduce water loss.
Their evergreen nature means that the needles can photosynthesize whenever there is sufficient sunlight.
The dense forest creates warmth during the harsh winter.
Soils are shallow due to lack of decomposition and weathering caused by the cold. They are acidic due to leaching from rainfall and they are also poor in nutrients.
The litter layer is thick with needles due to slow decomposition.
There are clear boundaries between the layers in the soil as there are few worms to mix it in the cold conditions.
The typical soil is a podsol, which has a distinctive ash grey layer (or horizon) above a red layer, which is rich in iron.

6816,"The ""Golden Age of Farming"" or ""High Farming"" took place in Great Britain between 1840 and 1870. The reason this period is given these two names is because farmers began to use more advanced and scientific techniques on their land for the very first time. These new techniques allowed them to produce higher crop yields, which led to lower food prices.
High Farming was able to take place in Britain for four main reasons:
- from 1801 onwards there was a dramatic rise in the size of the British population and by 1851 there were approximately twice as many people living in Britain as there had been in 1801. These people needed to be fed and many were unable to grow their own food.
- by the mid-1850s most of the population lived in new towns and worked in new factories, so did not have the time or space to grow their own food. Factory owners gave their workers higher wages to spend on food and this made farmers richer.
- the middle of the 19th century also saw an improvement in British transport. For example, there were now 5,000 miles of new railway tracks in Britain, which allowed fresh vegetables, milk and cheese to be moved more quickly around the country. Towns had access to fresh produce for the first time and this encouraged farming.
- British farming benefited from new colleges and institutions being set up to educate a new generation of farmers about new techniques that would give greater yields and more profits. The two most famous educational facilities were the Rothamsted Agricultural Research Station set up in 1842 and the Royal College for Agriculture in 1846.

CHANGED A title to the letter would be helpful, so readers know what to expect and what information to look for.
) Visit to Newtown Outdoor Pursuits Centre
We are planning to take all Year 11 students on a visit to Newtown Outdoor Pursuits Centre on Thursday 10 December (
The information given is too vague, eg parents need to know the exact times and places of departure and arrival.
). We shall leave school immediately after registration in the morning, and we intend to be back at the main school entrance by 7 o'clock in the evening. We shall be travelling by Brown's Executive Coaches, which are fitted with seat belts and speed limiters. If our return is delayed for any reason, you may contact the company for information on 01234-567890. (
It's also helpful to state the day as well as the date of the trip, and to give more details of special arrangements, eg about safety, what will happen if the return is delayed, etc.
Six teachers and several parent volunteers will accompany the students, who will be in groups of no more than ten throughout the day, always with at least one adult. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
If your son/daughter comes on the trip, s/he will need to bring a packed lunch, and sufficient drinks for an energetic day! No spending money is necessary, as there are no shops at the Centre. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
School uniform should not be worn for this trip; students should wear comfortable old clothes that will not be damaged by water or mud; any specialist equipment will be provided by the Centre. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
Newtown Outdoor Pursuits Centre offers a range of adventurous activities such as rock-climbing, abseiling, orienteering and canoeing. They are all supervised by fully-trained centre staff, and excellent first-aid facilities are available should any minor accidents occur. (
The description of what takes place at the Centre is too brief, eg there is no information about supervision of the students, or what specific clothing is needed for the activities.
We have arranged this visit as part of our students' personal and social education programme, to help them develop skills of teamwork and of supporting each other in challenging situations. (
The explanation of why the trip is taking place is vague, and is also mixed up with information about the cost.
We hope that you will agree to your son/daughter taking part in this day. If so, will you please sign and return the slip at the bottom of this letter with a donation of 10 (cash, or cheques made payable to 'Newtown High School Fund') to cover the cost of travel and use of facilities at the Centre. We regret that we may have to cancel the trip if insufficient donations are received. (
Information about paying is vague, eg who should the money be sent to? Should it be cash or cheque?
There is no explanation about what will be done with students who don't go on the trip, or what will happen if not enough want to go.
Parents are not given information about how to find out more about the trip.
Please contact me at the school if you wish to know any more about this visit. (
The language is too simple, eg 'child'. Although the letter is polite, it should be more detailed and informative.

Notice that nitrates and most chlorides are soluble. This is why many of the chemicals you use in the laboratory are nitrates or chlorides. If we want to make an insoluble salt, we can react together two soluble salts in a precipitation reaction.
Silver chloride is insoluble - you can see this from the table. We need a soluble silver salt and a soluble chloride salt to make it. Silver nitrate and sodium chloride are both soluble. When we mix their solutions together, we make insoluble silver chloride and soluble sodium nitrate.
The silver chloride appears as tiny particles suspended in the reaction mixture: it forms a precipitate. The precipitate can be filtered, washed with water on the filter paper and then dried in an oven.
Here are the word and balanced formulae equations for the reaction:

For example, nitrate fertilisers applied to farm land in larger quantities than the plants can absorb may be washed by the rain into rivers and lakes. Nitrates can be poisonous particularly for young people or if they're in high concentrations so care has to be taken to limit nitrates getting into water sources.
The large scale purification of sea water (desalination) uses large amounts of energy and needs specialised and expensive plant and equipment. The water produced would, therefore, be much more expensive than water from traditional sources.

He is verbally abused and bullied by most characters in the play and is called cruel names including
""villain with a smiling cheek, cut-throat dog, bloody creditor, damned inexecrable dog""
He is very astute and is aware of other people's concerns - he knows all about Antonio's business ventures.
""I hate him for he is a Christian; / But more, for that in low simplicity / He lends out money gratis.""
So, why does he make such a strange agreement with Antonio, asking for a pound of Antonio's flesh instead of interest if the loan is not repaid within the arranged time? Does he genuinely want to be friends with Antonio when he says
""I would be friends with you, and have your love?""
His daughter hates him and calls him a
We see him being impatient with her and ordering her around. When she runs away, he seems as upset about the loss of his money as her:
""My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! ... My ducats and my daughter!""
It would seem that Shylock cares for money more than anything else. Yet in an often forgotten moment When Shylock finds out his daughter traded his wife's ring for monkey he cares only for its sentimental value.
""Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my turquoise; / I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: / I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.""
Perhaps it is the loss of Jessica as well as all the harsh treatment he has suffered from Antonio - and others - over the years that makes him bitter enough to ask for Antonio's pound of flesh.
He cleverly argues in Act III, scene 1 that he is as much a man as a Christian is and so will follow the example the Christians set by seeking revenge.
""The villainy you teach me I will execute.""
He is thrilled to hear that another of Antonio's ships is lost, making Antonio more vulnerable.

""Thou call'dst me dog ... But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.""
He knows that the Venetian justice system will have to support him and so relishes beating Antonio at his own game.
refuses to listen to all the pleas for mercy
during the trial scene (from the Duke, Bassanio and Balthazar), insisting all the time on justice and his pound of flesh. Do you think this is this a sign of strength or foolishness? He could have pardoned Antonio and shown himself to be morally superior - but would this have done him any good in the long run?
Caught out by Portia, by the end of the trial he has lost all his money and has to suffer the humiliation of being forced to become a Christian. Shakespeare doesn't give Shylock any lines to tell us how he feels. How should he react? We never find out what happens to him.

check against the specification: does the product meet all aspects of the specification?
is the text accurate, spelt correctly, with correct grammar and layout?

are the registration marks correct and do they line up?
have correct desktop publishing (DTP) layout templates been used?
check measurements: are they within the tolerances specified?
for products such as pop-up books, check the cut and fit of different parts: do they fit accurately and neatly without gaps?

There are four main types of production system used in manufacturing graphic products, each one suitable for a different scale of production.
is when only one of the product is made. It is labour-intensive, because every product is different. One-off graphic products might include a presentation book as a souvenir of a special event, or a model of a theatre set.
is when a set quantity of the product is made. It may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product. Batch-produced graphic products include programmes for a play or concert, or posters to advertise a play or concert.
is when a very large number of the product is made, usually on a production line - but the process cannot be continuous because the product regularly changes. Examples of mass-produced graphic products are newspapers and magazines.
production is when many thousands of products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to eliminate the expense of stopping and restarting the production process. The process is often automated and few workers are required. Continuous-flow production is used for graphics products which sell very large numbers throughout the year, and do not need to be frequently changed - such as cereal packaging.
Information and communications technology is widely used in manufacturing graphics products. Its benefits are that:
it makes it easy to produce accurate, complex, standardised drawings
It allows complex shapes to be made with ease and precision
it enables changes to be made quickly and easily, and
it greatly simplifies batch or mass production
CAM machines are good for batch or mass production, and they are also useful for one-off products that are complicated to make. There are two types of CAM machine:
Plotter/cutters can be used either for cutting of card and vinyl, or (by replacing the blade with a pen) to produce drawings and lettering prior to cutting. Cutter/printers are more complex CAM machines which allow full-colour printing before cutting is done.
These are mainly used for cutting plastics, hard wax, soft metals and wood-based materials such as MDF. They are particularly useful for making prototype models and moulds for vacuum-forming. Some of these machines can have a scanner head fitted in place of the cutting tool, allowing 3D scanning to be done.

When Gerald returns from his walk he explains that he also had suspicions about the Inspector and had found out that there is no Inspector Goole on the force, which Birling confirms with a phone call.
They gradually realise that perhaps the Inspector conned them - he could have showed each person a different photograph - and when they telephone the infirmary, they realise that there hasn't been a suicide case for months. Birling is delighted, assuming they are now all off the hook, while Sheila and Eric maintain that nothing has changed - each of them still committed the acts that the Inspector had accused them of, even if they did turn out to be against five different girls.

Typically, they are detached or semi detached and the roads around them are arranged in cul de sacs and wide avenues. Land prices are generally cheaper than in the CBD and inner city, although the desirability of housing can make some areas expensive.
Many suburbs were built in the UK in the 1930s and have a distinctive style of housing, as shown in the picture to the right. More modern housing estates were built in the late 20th century as towns and cities have continued to grow.
Facilities such as schools, places of worship and parks are often present, and many are served by a local supermarket.
Suburban areas are often home to commuters who need access to the CBD along main roads and railways, and they are also within easy reach of the countryside.

The reader lives Pip's life with him, and we see:
the way contact with rich people makes him dissatisfied.
how coming into money makes him shallow and selfish, and unhappy.
how trying to find love with a beautiful, yet cruel, girl makes him unhappy - the plain, good girl would have been better.
how disappointments change his character for the better.
how Pip is happier when he settles down to a decent living through hard work - this is one of the main messages of the novel.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The wedding night
Juliet can't wait for her wedding night. But when the Nurse tells her what happened to Tybalt, Juliet doesn't know whether to love or hate Romeo. She can't believe that he is being sent away and threatens to kill herself, so the Nurse promises to find Romeo and bring him to Juliet's bedroom.
Friar Lawrence is hiding Romeo. When he tells Romeo what Prince Escalus has decided, Romeo says that he would rather die than be sent away. The Nurse arrives. Romeo tries to stab himself, but the Nurse and the Friar stop him. The Friar gives Romeo a good telling off for being so ungrateful and for behaving like a girl! He and the Nurse arrange for Romeo to spend his last night in Verona with Juliet as long as he promises to leave for Mantua first thing in the morning.
The Capulets are grieving for Tybalt. Paris comes to see Juliet but she won't come down from her bedroom. Capulet tells Paris that he will sort things out between them because he is sure his daughter will do what he tells her to do. He suggests that Paris marries her on ThursdayIt is now Monday.
Romeo and Juliet have spent the night together. Juliet hears a lark (larks sing at dawn), but tries to persuade Romeo that it was a nightingale (nightingales sing at night) because she doesn't want the night to end. When Romeo says that he will stay and face death for her, Juliet changes her mind and makes him hurry to get up and leave. Juliet has a premonition of him dead in a grave.

192,"The beginning of a text is crucial to its success. If the start is weak, there is a risk that the reader will lose interest and stop reading it.
Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing:
Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail.
Why is this an effective opening for the text?
It is totally in keeping with the title.
It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text.
It gives a summary of both sides of the argument.
Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below.
This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century.
This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence.
The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt.
A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood.
This is prose rather than a non-fictional argument. It uses descriptive and figurative language. It could be the opening of a short story or a novel.

In those days, that would have been a sin, and to marry two people at once would mean that she would be sent to hell. Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide.
Paris goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her.

a shadow came sweeping up after me
into the darkness overhead. I came along the landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling sound that I fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor.
What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this?
The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects.
The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere.

Animals and plants can wear away rocks. This is called
weathering. For example, burrowing animals such as rabbits can burrow into a crack in a rock, making it bigger and splitting the rock.
You may have seen weeds growing through cracks in the pavement. If you have gone for a walk in the countryside, you may even have seen bushes or trees growing from cracks in rocks or disused buildings. This is because
can grow in cracks. As they grow bigger, the roots push open the cracks and make them wider and deeper. Eventually pieces of rock may fall away.
People can even cause biological weathering just by walking. Over time, paths in the countryside become damaged because of all the boots and shoes wearing them away.

The Tempest second key extract - Performance
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts?
From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is a lot of conflict in the first extract, the second one is full of romance. This needs to be brought out in the performance.
Prospero is in control of the action. He even slows the pace down at one point to suit his own ends. He could be compared to Shakespeare, moving the plot forward and molding events.
Prospero watches from a distance and comments occasionally but does not interfere. It is as though he is part of the audience.
Is a more gentle and humorous end to what has been a very tense and action-packed scene.
A moving and romantic extract that contrasts with the scene before it which is full of Mercutio's rude jokes.
Ariel is present at the beginning. Prospero uses magic to prevent Ferdinand from using his sword. Ferdinand seems to submit very quickly at the end of this extract, as though magic may have had some part to play.
There is no sign of magic in this extract. The setting is very ordinary as Ferdinand carries logs to Prospero's cave. Any ""magic"" that exists is in the form of the power of love.
Both Ferdinand and Miranda seem bewildered by their feelings.
Ferdinand and Miranda are bursting to reveal their true feelings to each other.
The tone changes quickly within this scene that contains violence and anger.
The tone remains calm. This is a very moving scene.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Performance
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
haracters and how you respond to them
anguage used - the detail about love, for example
ssues and ideas - like time, love and hate
Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself.
Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question.
How should an actor playing Benvolio behave?
Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl.
When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious.
The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life.
Once you understand the First Key Extract, you are ready to move on to the second.

> Changes in the environment - Pollution
Living things produce waste materials, such as urine and faeces. Humans produce these, too, but they also produce other waste materials. These materials can pollute the environment. They include:
Rubbish is taken to a landfill site
Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in
sites. These may be disused quarries or rough ground that cannot be used for farming or housing. When landfill sites are full of rubbish, they are covered in soil and planted with trees and bushes.
rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used.
Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication.
Smoke from burning fuels makes buildings turn black. With other waste chemicals in the air, it can form smog. This makes the air hazy, especially over large towns and cities. The polluted air can make it difficult to breathe.
are produced when fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas burn. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in the clouds and causes acid rain. This damages buildings, trees and harms life in rivers and lakes. It also causes chemical weathering of rocks to happen much faster than normal.

Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words.
The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song.
Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion.
He wonders where the sounds are coming from.
Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better.
He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned.
When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real.
Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem.
Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along
Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic.
, and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together.
Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess.
Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another.
He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him.
Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss.
Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter.
Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others?
Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand.
Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic?
She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view.
When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily.
Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him.
He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy.
Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion.
Miranda tries to speak up for him
You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem.
but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'.
When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move.
Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison.
Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells?
Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel
Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured.
Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free
Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master.
if he carries out all of his commands. Ariel agrees. Prospero orders Ferdinand to follow him and tells Miranda not to try and speak up for him.

367,"The extract below is about zombies. Note down your answers to the questions that follow and then check them against ours.
""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."".
This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti.
The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition.
Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land.
From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans.
Q1. The writer chooses to begin the extract with a story based on someone's actual experience. Why do you think he did this?
Q2. What is the effect of the two short sentences which open the extract?
Q3. In the third sentence, why does the speaker use a list of three adjectives to describe the zombie's eyes?
Q4. Why did Seabrook believe for a moment that he had met a real zombie?
Q5. Which words tell you he did not really believe this?
Q6. In the second paragraph, how does the writer use language to convince us that the zombie is a terrifying creature?
Q7. Which other creatures are compared to the zombie in the third paragraph?
Q8. Give two reasons why the zombie's fate is described as ""even worse"".
Q9. What is the purpose of this text?
A1. They did this to make the whole text sound more believable, and to add lively detail to the factual section which follows it.
A3. They help the reader to build up a picture of the zombie, making the writing more dramatic.
A4. He had seen 'so much previously in Haiti that was outside normal experience' that he thought it might be a real zombie.
A5. The words which tell us he didn't really believe this are: 'for a flash of a second', 'panicky lapse' and 'maybe'.
A6. The writer uses the phrase 'one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural'. You might also have picked out the phrase 'walking corpse'.
A7. Zombies are compared to vampires and werewolves.
A8. The zombie's fate is worse because it can't think, it can't return to human form, it is doomed to slave labour and it has no memory of its home or loved ones.
A9. The text has two purposes: firstly, to inform us about zombies, and secondly, to entertain.

Cells in the lining of the breathing tubes produce sticky mucus to trap dirt and microbes. Cells with tiny hair-like parts, called

Hot smoke and tar from smoking damages the cilia. So smokers cough to move the mucus and are more likely to get

Carbon monoxide is a gas that takes the place of oxygen in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry. This means that the circulatory system has to work harder, causing heart disease.

527,"Every December, certain beaches and islands along the West Coast of the United States and Mexico fill with the sights and sounds of elephant seals. Visitors can't miss the huge animals, which make as much noise as a pack of motorcycles.
To learn about elephant seals, go to
Until recently, however, those beaches were quieter because elephant seals were almost extinct. But in the last few years, the seals have made one of the most amazing comebacks of any animal.
Nearly a century ago, only 100 elephant seals were left in the wild. Hunters had killed the animals for their
, or fat, which was used to make lamp oil to light people's homes. In addition, their skins were often used for clothing.
In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law protecting elephant seals. Now, because of that law, more than 150,000 of the seals live in the wild.
Elephant seals spend much of the year swimming in the Pacific Ocean, far from shore. The seals are looking for food, such as fish and squid. They can swim about 35 miles from shore and dive as deep as 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to search for food. (That's about as deep as a whale can dive!)
By December, elephant seals head for beaches in California and Mexico. They hit the beaches to mate and raise their young. When male elephant seals, called
, haul themselves out of the water, they can weigh as much as 4,500 pounds, or two small cars.
Ao Nuevo is Spanish for ""New Year.""
The world's largest colony of elephant seals spends the winter at the Ao Nuevo State Reserve in California. As many as 5,000 elephant seals spend the winter there. Visitors to the reserve can see the giant seals. One visitor said the animals are ""a cross between a beanbag and a Volkswagen bug.""
However, visitors have to watch out for the giant animals. Seals may look fat and slow, but they anger quickly and can move 20 feet in two seconds.
Some visitors are scientists who want to figure out ways to help seals survive.
One way scientists have learned about elephant seals is by attaching radios to the backs of the animals. The radios send out signals. The radios have helped scientists learn how far and how deep elephant seals swim.

I think that we should have mandatory child-safety trigger locks. I think that we should have a photo license ID requirement for the purchase of a new handgun.

But these days, the Great Barrier Reef has found itself in trouble. Over fishing, pollution, and high temperatures are harming its health. That's why the government in Australia is trying to help rescue the reef.
While coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals. Those sea animals are called
As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over thousands of years, they form a coral reef in warm water that is not very deep.
In many ways, the Great Barrier Reef resembles an underwater garden. Coral can be hard or soft. It forms in different colors and in strange shapes. Some coral looks like hardened brains. Other coral looks like fans and lettuces. The reef bursts with schools of tropical fish, darting among gaps in the coral.
The reef supplies food and shelter to creatures living in and around the coral. Turtles, sharks, sea horses, and crabs are among its many inhabitants. The reef also acts as a barrier to keep waves from slamming against the shore.
While the reef is important to ocean life, it helps humans, too. People rely on the reef for both food and jobs. It also provides medicine used to treat disease. Each year, the Great Barrier Reef contributes about $975 million to the economy through tourism and fishing.
Is it surprising, then, that the Great Barrier Reef is under too much stress? Fishing nets and ships break off sections and damage the reef. Air and water pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures have caused

In an effort to help save the reef, the government has limited fishing to two-thirds of it. That plan increases the number of ""green zones."" Those are areas that are off-limits to fishermen and boats. However, tourists and researchers can still visit them. Many fishermen are upset about the plan because they rely on the reef for jobs.
The Australian government says that its plan will help keep the reef safe from some threats. ""It is very important that we give the reef proper protection for the future,"" said one government official. ""The reef is Australia's greatest natural [treasure].""

116,"Scientists are balancing animal populations out West.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the moveand they're flying firstclass. Wildlife workers are using helicopters to send Utah's moose to Colorado. In exchange, wildlife officials in Colorado are capturing bighorn sheep to send to Utah. The animal swap is part of a plan to keep the moose and sheep populations in both states healthy.
Rocky Mountain moose are on the move.
One of the largest moose hauls took place in January, when a single helicopter team captured 24 of the animals in a day. The moose are now roaming free in the Grand Mesa National Forest in Colorado, where the appearance of calves indicates that the moose population is growing. Colorado workers planned to hold up their end of the bargain by capturing 20 bighorn sheep to send to Utah in February.
""This year was a major group move,"" Stephanie Duckett, a biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, told
Biologists are scientists who study living things. Duckett works at Grand Mesa, which didn't have any moose two years ago. ""So far we have moved 90 moose to the mesa,"" she says. Most of those animals came from Weber County, Utah, where the moose population is in trouble.
The moose in northern Utah are threatened by
That means there are too many animals for the environment to feed and support. Overpopulation can lead to animal starvation and disease. ""It's bad for the population and bad for the environment,"" says Duckett.
Wildlife officials often try to prevent overpopulation by issuing permits that allow hunters to kill more animals during hunting season. That wasn't an option with Utah's moose; many of them live on private land where hunting is
or not allowed. Instead, wildlife officials decided to make a trade.
""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose, and we've lost a lot of our bighorn sheep population,"" Utah wildlife manager Justin Dolling told
Colorado had a healthy supply of bighorn sheep to send to Utah, and Colorado had plenty of room for Utah's extra moose.
Once they had a plan, wildlife officials had to find a way to safely catch the wild mooseone of the largest animal species in North America. They turned to animalcapture expert James Innes and his experienced team of helicopter ""moose muggers."" A moose mugger is an animal worker trained to capture a moose without harming it. ""We have zero tolerance for
Innes's helicopter chases a moose into a clearing by flying over the forest before dropping a net to catch the animal. Once the moose is down, a moose mugger jumps out of the hovering helicopter and secures the animal's legs. ""You have to use every trick in the book to tie them up,"" says Innes.
Once the moose is secured, it is placed in a canvas bag that hangs from the helicopter and then flown to a base camp. There, a veterinarian, or an animal doctor, gives the moose a checkup before it is placed on a truck and taken to its final destinationGrand Mesa.
Wildlife managers tackled the moose overpopulation problem in Utah by sending moose to areas where they would have enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy.

Adult moose are too large to be hunted by other animals. Human hunters are their only predator. Half of all moose scalves are killed by wolves, grizzly bears, or black bears.
How might other animals living in the same environment be hurt by moose overpopulation? How does the animal swap help solve that problem?

What is the goal of the week? ""It's not about giving up TV altogether,"" Frank Vespe, the head of TV-Turnoff Network told

An unexpected guest greeted a crew aboard a barge on the Thames River in London. A passing sea gull dropped a dangerous
(pih-RAHN-ah) onto the boat's deck. The fish had died just before it made its crash landing.
With razor-sharp teeth, piranhas are the most ferocious fish in the world. Officials were quick to assure Londoners that the Thames is safe. They believe that the 4-inch-long red-bellied piranha's owner probably released it into the river, where a sea gull picked it up.
Experts say that the temperature of the Thames is too cold for piranhas to survive. These warm-water fish are found mainly in South America.
Piranhas have a reputation that is worse than their bite, say some experts. ""Piranhas are generally nervous and are not the ferocious killers people think they are,"" said Paul Hale, the head of the London Aquarium. ""They prey on weak and injured animals, including fish, birds, and mammals.""

The actor recently announced that he is running for governor of California in the state's
election on October 7. The recall is a special election allowed by California law. People will vote whether to remove the current governor, Gray Davis, from office.
Some people in California are unhappy with the job that Davis is doing. They blame him for the state's money problems.
Schwarzenegger, the star of movies such as
and Kindergarten Cop, is one of many people running to replace Davis. The actor is getting a lot of attention because of his movie-star status.
Schwarzenegger is no stranger to politics. From 1990 to 1993, he headed the Council on Physical Fitness under President George H. W. Bush. In 2002, he helped raise millions of dollars for school programs in California.
Schwarzenegger isn't the first actor to try to make the move from Hollywood star to governor. Movie star Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. He then served as U.S. president from 1981 to 1989.
Even if he is elected, Schwarzenegger won't be following Reagan's path to the White House. He was not born in the United States, which is a requirement for being president.

: About how many poems have you written?
: When did you begin to write poetry?

: What are some common themes that run through your poetry?
: I like to write about seeing the hopeful side of things. I call my poems
because they're born in my heart and if I sit very still and listen, I can hear them.
: Where do you get the ideas for your poetry?
: The ideas for my poems come from everywhere-playing with a friend, or visiting the Vietnam War Memorial [in Washington, D.C.], or going to the hospital-just anything that happens.
: Can you tell us about your latest book of poetry,
has more than 60 poems, and they're about love-love of friends and nature and love of peace.
: What advice do you have for kids who might find writing poetry hard?
: I'd tell them... just think about something you care about and listen to your heart, and some words will come to you. Just say your feelings in your own words.
What are some things that might inspire you to write poetry?

224,"One of the world's biggest oil rigs sank into the Atlantic Ocean last month. The rig, called P-36, sank in the waters about 75 miles off the coast of Brazil, South America, after a series of explosions damaged a pillar supporting it.
The explosions killed ten workers and injured others. Workers struggled for days to save the rig, only to see it slowly topple over and sink into the ocean.
Officials from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which owns the rig, were concerned after some of the 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel and crude oil on the rig leaked out. But the spill turned out to be smaller than expected.
The problem now facing Brazil is the loss of oil production. The P-36 rig provided a large portion of the oil Brazil uses to make fuel. Now the country will have to import more oil from other countries to meet demands.

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
There have been a lot of empty desks in schools across the United States this winter. Many kids have stayed home while sick with the flu bug that is raging across the country.
Chances are if the flu hasn't made you sick yet, it has infected someone you know. Experts say the flu season struck more than a month earlier than its normal start. It began in October and spread quickly. Flu season typically runs from December through April.
""Most of us are convinced this was a hard flu season on children,"" said one flu expert. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been jammed with sick patients, especially kids. Some schools even closed because the flu outbreak was so severe.

Unlike a cold, the flu usually strikes suddenly and without warning. Some

Someone who has the flu virus can easily infect other people. The flu is highly

The flu virus spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Other people can catch the flu by breathing in the airborne germs.
You can also get the flu by coming in contact with places where germs hang out-such as computer keyboards and door handles-and then touching your mouth or nose.
Although there is no cure for the flu, health experts say that getting a
(VAK-seen) can help protect people from becoming sick. A vaccine is a substance that fights the flu virus.
This season, many people lined up to get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Each year, the flu virus changes. Scientists develop a vaccine to protect people from the type of virus that is spreading.
Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that ""there's still plenty of flu out there,"" this organization has some good news. It reports that the number of flu cases appears to be on the decline.
At press time, health officials say only five states report that the flu is widespread. That number is down from 45 at the flu's
, or highest point, in December. Now, that's something to feel better about!
What Should You Do If the Flu Sneaks Up on You?

What Should You Do to Avoid the Flu?
To keep flu germs from spreading, practice these healthful habits:
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Remember to throw away the tissue!
Avoid touching your nose, eyes, or mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.

Do you skip breakfast most mornings? If you're like most kids, you probably do!
A new school year can be a good time to get into the habit of eating a healthful breakfast, say experts. Recent studies show that eating breakfast boosts both your health and your brainpower.

and a balanced diet during the day will help your body get the nutrients it needs.
The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods:
Complex carbohydrates found in foods such as cereal provide your body with energy. Your body stores up the energy and uses it when you need it!
Protein also supplies your body with energy and helps fight infection. Eggs and cheese are good sources of protein.
Vitamins and minerals help the body grow. Milk and other dairy products provide your body with vitamin D and calcium, a mineral that helps build strong teeth and bones. Fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals. You should eat at least five servings of them a day.

Studies show that kids who eat a healthful breakfast learn better, pay more attention in class, and are less likely to miss school. Experts also say that kids who eat breakfast are less likely to overeat later in the day.
That is good news. Along with regular exercise, eating breakfast can lower the risk of becoming
About 9 million kids in the United States are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems, such as heart disease, later in life.

Grab that slice of leftover veggie pizza. Eat it cold or warm it up.
Make a breakfast sundae. Top a bowl of yogurt with fresh fruit and granola.
Toast cheese on whole-grain bread. Wash it down with a glass of cold orange juice.
Got milk? Enjoy a cup with a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay.
A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day.
Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time.
You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed.
Leaving time for breakfast will give you the brainpower you need in school and will keep you going until the lunch bell rings. ""Breakfast really helps to start your engine!"" says Campbell.

Before the war began, this zoo in Baghdad was one of the largest in the Middle East. More than 600 animals were housed there.
When fighting began, the zoo was turned into a battleground. At one point, the zoo's population dropped to as few as six animals.
Many animals died and others were stolen, especially many of the birds. The cages of other animals were left open. Animals, such as lions and camels, roamed the streets. Other animals, locked in their cages, were left without food and water.
U.S. soldiers were the first people to come to the animals' rescue. They secured the zoo, found some of the wild creatures, and helped feed them. Since then, wildlife groups have helped nurse many of the sick animals back to health.

Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn.
The planets rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planets rings are only about half a mile thick.
In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturns moons. The scientists primary focus is Saturns largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto.
(HOY-ginz). The probe will parachute through the murky atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. That will be the most far-reaching landing that a spacecraft has ever made from our planet.
Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea.
What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we dont know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster.
Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn.

A new PEZ museum recently opened in Easton, Pennsylvania. It's the third PEZ museum in the country to display the famous candy dispensers.
If you're looking for a popular character, chances are you'll find it here! The museum is home to 1,500 PEZ dispensers, from SpongeBob SquarePants and Charlie Brown to Garfield and Santa Claus.
In addition, Disney-themed PEZ dispensers are displayed in a 10-foot-high castle. Visitors can even play a ""Where in the World Is Waldo?"" game on a wall display of more than 500 dispensers.
The museum also has some rare PEZ dispensers that are very valuable. A baseball bat, ball, and glove PEZ dispenser from the 1960s sells for about $400!
Many children and adults get excited over the plastic PEZ dispensers. ""For me it combines the two favorite elements of childhood... toys and candy,"" said Jill Cohen, an adult PEZ collector.
According to the Connecticut company that makes PEZ, Americans consume a lot of the tiny candy. More than 3 billion PEZ candies are eaten each year in the United States!
The candy traces its roots back to 1927. It was invented in the European country of Austria as a mint to help people quit smoking. So how exactly did the candy get its name? PEZ is derived from the word

252,"The Southeast: Exploring the 'Land of the Flowers'
Long before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Spaniards had explored and settled large parts of what is now the United States.
One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region.
After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de Len, had named the land
, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"".
La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote.
Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted.
Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them.
De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama.
In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken.
De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died.
The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast.

119,"Doctors are always on guard against germs. They frequently wash their hands. Now, however, doctors are being told not to wash their hands with soap and water.
Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up.
What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning.
Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital.
If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!

The final countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 2, millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote for the next president of the United States.
The race to the White House is long and hard, but the finish line is in sight for President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. As Election Day draws close, the candidates are busy
Each of the candidates for president belongs to a

John Kerry, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is the Democratic candidate running against Bush. His running mate for vice president is John Edwards, a U.S. senator from North Carolina.
John Kerry and John Edwards are the Democratic team.
With Election Day just weeks away, the presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail to get their messages out. They are meeting voters, giving speeches, and telling people why they think they are best qualified to lead the country.
The candidates are also speaking out about important
, or problems, that our country faces. Some of those issues include rebuilding Iraq, protecting the environment, and improving schools.
Political polls predict that the 2004 presidential election will be a close race. The candidates know that every vote will count.
""I want to be your president for four more years,"" Bush said in a speech on the campaign trail. ""From creating jobs to improving our schools, from fighting terror to spreading the peace, we made much progress, and there is more to do.""
Those issues are important to Kerry too. ""You meet incredible people, and you want to make their lives better,"" said Kerry. ""They tell you about their lives--their schools, the cost of health care, or their sons and daughters serving in Iraq. It's a huge sense of responsibility and a daily reminder of why elections are so important.""
Who will be the best person for the job? The American people will decide on Election Day.
Winning the presidential election tops the list of George W. Bush and John Kerry these days, but that wasn't always the case. Both candidates dreamed of being sports stars as kids.
President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born.
As a child, Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. When he was 10 years old, Bush used to mail cards to famous baseball players to have them autographed and returned to him.
Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also served as governor of Texas for six years.
Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. His family moved to Massachusetts a few months after he was born.
As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player and even thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. He played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse in college.
As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. Before serving as a Massachusetts senator for the past 20 years, Kerry was the lieutenant governor of that state for two years.

Scientists suspect the hole is 30 miles long and 30 miles wide. Using a robotic device called Toby, the team will film the site and take samples to study. ""It is like a window into the interior of Earth,"" says scientist Bramley Murton from aboard the research ship.
Earth is made up of four layers, which get hotter and hotter, from the surface to the center.
The crust is the surface of Earth. The thin layer is made of solid rock.
The mantle is divided into two parts: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. Most of the mantle is solid rock, but the lower mantle rock is softer.
The hot outer core is made of liquid iron and nickel.
The inner core is the center of Earth. It is made up of scorching-hot iron and nickel, which stay solid due to intense pressure.

The task force will create computer models to figure out whether and when one of these flying objects might hit Earth. Its path would then be plotted on a map. Although there are no asteroid busters right now, scientists hope that soon rockets could be sent to knock asteroids off course.
Close encounters may be scary, but they help to give astronomers opportunities to better understand the beginnings of our solar system. Many scientists believe that asteroids and comets are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago.
""Its through collisions that planets are born,"" Giovanni Valsecchi, an astronomer from Italy, told reporters. ""And its through collisions that planets die.""
There are more than 1 million asteroids circling the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
Some asteroids are smaller than a car. Others are hundreds of miles across.
The first known asteroid was discovered in 1801. Today, asteroids are found regularly.
The largest asteroid is named Ceres. It is about the size of Maine. Ceres was recently classified as a dwarf planet, along with Pluto.

750,"Look at the coins in your pocket. Most likely, the coins have something in common: a U.S. president pictured on one side. Most U.S coins have depicted presidents since 1909.
Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel.
""After almost 100 years, even Lincoln himself would probably say enough is enough,"" said coin collector Fred Weinberg.
Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes.
""I'm not putting down dead dignitaries, but the public wants to see something new to stimulate pride and interest, not just in coins, but in history,"" Weinberg said.
Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006.
U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin.
Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964.
Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is.
""We're open to change in color and general design... but we certainly would not be open to just replacing President Lincoln's image with a flower or something else,"" said a fan of the Lincoln penny.
A slippery $20 gold coin recently sold for almost $8 million!
In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had ordered all but two $20 gold coins destroyed. Those two coins were given to the Smithsonian Institution.
Shortly before the rest of the coins were destroyed, ten were stolen. All but one of the stolen coins were later found and destroyed.
The missing coin was found in Egypt in 1954. Before U.S. officials could claim it, the coin disappeared again. The coin turned up in London in the 1990s. U.S. officials brought it back to the United States. This year, it went to auction.

With the exception of Grover Cleveland, each president will appear on only one coin. Cleveland was the only president to serve two terms that weren't
or back-to-back. To be depicted on a coin, a president must have been dead for at least two years.
Past presidents aren't the first people to be depicted on $1 coins. Female leaders Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea have appeared on the coins. Anthony dedicated her life to fighting for women's rights in the 1800s. Native American guide Sacagawea led explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their westward journey to find a route to the Pacific Ocean.
The idea of rotating coin designs comes from the 50 State Quarters Program. Those quarters began circulating in 1999. The state quarters program has been very popular, introducing millions of people to coin collecting. The U.S. Mint hopes the presidential coins will be as successful.

66,"An ancient mystery lurks beneath the coffin of King Tutankhamen (too-tahng-KAH-men). Researchers are trying to determine whether a horrible crime thousands of years ago led to the young Egyptian king's death. Did someone murder a boy called King Tut?
In an attempt to solve the mystery, scientists are X-raying the mummy of the
A pharaoh refers to an ancient Egyptian king.
""The question of whether [King Tut] was murdered or not will be completely answered,"" said Egypt's top archaeologist.
King Tut lived in Egypt more than 3,300 years ago. Despite suffering from a spine disease that made it difficult for him to turn his head, Tut probably spent his childhood swimming in the Nile River, hunting ducks, and learning how to read and write.
After his father died, the young boy was thrown into the royal spotlight. Tut was crowned king at about the age of 10! His reign, however, did not last very long. By 18 years old, he was dead.
Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, discovered King Tut's tomb in 1922.
The mystery of how King Tut died has fascinated people since Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, found his secret
in 1922. A tomb is a burial place.
Ancient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut's mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders.
The tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut's childhood toys. Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. They buried their dead with favorite items they believed could be used in the afterlife.
murdered, crime experts believe the culprit was likely someone close to him. Scientists have narrowed the list to four suspects: his wife, his treasurer, his prime minister, and his military chief.
They suspect those four people because they would have known about Tut's spine disease. His weak condition would have made him an easy target. They also might have had
, or reasons, to murder Tut. (See ""
Why do scientists think Tut was killed? They say the tomb's small size and its rushed state hint that he might have died unexpectedly.
At the time of the tomb's discovery in 1922, experts had ruled out foul play. Yet X-rays taken in 1968 revealed a different story. They showed a hole in Tut's skull, suggesting he might have suffered a severe blow to the head.
Tut's mummy was flown to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for new X-rays. X-ray technology today is more sophisticated than it was in 1968. Thanks to modern
, or crime-solving techniques, scientists hope the question of whether Tut was murdered will soon be answered.
Was a crime committed? Clues point to four main suspects.
Although paintings in Tut's tomb depict a loving wife, experts say she could still have had a motive. Shortly after Tut died, his wife wrote a letter to the leader of another nation. She requested help in finding a new husband. In ancient Egypt, it was possible for women to become pharaohs. Did she murder her husband to become pharaoh herself?
Tut's treasurer, Maya, had easy access to him during his reign. Evidence, however, shows that Maya liked the boy king. He rebuilt Tut's burial chamber after it was robbed. A gift in Tut's tomb also bears Maya's name. Although Maya was the least likely to ascend to the throne after Tut's death, could the treasurer have been so jealous of the boy king that he murdered him?
Ay was Tut's adviser and grandfather. He became pharaoh upon Tut's death. After Tut died, Ay pressured Tut's wife to marry him. Marrying her made him king of Egypt. Shortly after their wedding, the new bride mysteriously disappeared. Some people think a painting of a hunting scene in Ay's tomb proves his crime. The painting was an odd choice for a royal tomb. Was Ay confessing his crime through the killing in the painting?
War threatened Egypt during Tut's rule. His military chief might have thought the boy king was too young to protect Egypt from its enemies. Because the chief drove Tut's chariot, some experts suspect that he pushed the young pharaoh to his death. After the prime minister's death, the military chief became king of Egypt. At that time, he attempted to erase records of Tut's life. Could that have been to cover up a crime?

To win the prize, McNally competed against 47 other contestants in the 2003 National Monopoly Championship.
The tournament was held aboard a train hired especially for the event. Called the ""Reading Railroad,"" the train was named after a railroad property on the game board.
Although the tournament has taken place every four years since 1973, this year's event was the first to be held on a moving train. Players boarded in Chicago and began rolling the dice.
In 1934, Charles B. Darrow of Pennsylvania invented Monopoly. The Parker Brothers company bought the game in 1935 and has since sold more than 200 million copies worldwide.
From there, the train completed a three-day journey to Atlantic City, New Jersey-the city on which the game is based and where the final round was held. Along the way, the train made stops in Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.

The president chose Alito to replace Justice Sandra Day OConnor, who announced her retirement in July. In 1981, OConnor became the first woman in history to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Bush had first nominated Harriet Miers, a White House lawyer, to take OConnors place. However, Miers withdrew her nomination after coming under fire partly for a lack of experience. Miers had never been a judge. OConnor is serving on the Supreme Court until a replacement is confirmed.
Alito grew up in New Jersey in a family that valued learning. Both of his parents were teachers. He has argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court, losing just two.
As a federal judge, Alito has also served on a lower court for the past 15 years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With 29 years of legal experience, Bush says, Alito ""has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years.""
To become a Supreme Court justice, a nominee must be approved by the Senate. A series of Senate confirmation hearings, where Alito will answer questions about his views on laws, are set to begin on January 9, 2006. Senate leaders hope to have a final confirmation vote on January 20.

The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the country. The red-crested bird's body is shiny blue-black. It has white markings on its neck and on both edges of its huge wings. The woodpecker's wingspan extends almost 3 feet. The bird also has a straight bill, short legs, and feet with curved claws.

For people who doubted the videotape of the woodpeckers, the scientists collected more proof. They recorded the bird's double knock.
The recording made believers out of the doubters. ""Hearing [the recording] was very exciting!"" Richard Prum, a scientist from Yale University who studies birds, told

What are people doing to help the number of ivory-billed woodpeckers bounce back? Nature lovers are cutting down some trees in a select area of Arkansas. Sound strange? The woodpeckers feed on young beetles that thrive under the bark of fallen trees. With more food for the woodpeckers, bird lovers hope that the ivorybill's double knock will become a common sound again.

The babies are receiving constant care at the nature center. They are covered with white hair and weigh 4 to 6 ounces. That's about the size of a hot dog.
As the pandas grow, they will develop black hair on their ears and around their eyes. Black hair will also grow across their shoulders and on their legs.
The infants offer hope to scientists concerned about pandas, which are endangered. The nature center is home to more than 60 pandas. There are fewer than 1,100 giant pandas left in the wild.
Pandas in the wild live in bamboo forests in the mountains of China. The panda's diet consists mainly of bamboo shoots, stems, and leaves. Pandas lose their homes and have less food to eat when people cut down bamboo forests for wood and farmland. In an effort to protect pandas, the government of China has made it illegal to cut down bamboo in certain areas.

Californias newly discovered cave creatures hold clues to monitoring changes in the environment.

or almost clear. Its internal organs are visibleeven its bright-yellow liver! There was also a daddy longlegs with a jaw larger than its body, as well as a little, bright-orange spider. Some creatures were so tiny that scientists had to use the fine hairs of a paintbrush to collect them.
""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27.""
Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earths surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havent been explored as thoroughly as the surface.
Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youre Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers.""
This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment.
The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caves entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told
""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment.""
A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnt need pigment in its skin because it doesnt have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves.
The next task is to name the new species. Specialists called
are working to classify and name the creatures.
Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the
An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment.
The recent discoveries have led park officials to plan to protect the caves and the newfound species. ""Now that we know the species are there, we can use them to learn more about cave ecosystems and life on this planet,"" says Myers.

231,"A Hurricane Hunter flies the plane into the eye of a hurricane.
One flight crew took Hurricane Isabel by storm. Called
, they actually flew a plane into the center of Isabel in mid-September.
Isabel packed winds of up to 100 miles per hour by the time it hit land. The storm walloped the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia and then moved inland.
The hurricane caused massive flooding and damage. More than 4.5 million people lost electricity. At least 40 deaths were blamed on the storm.
Despite the devastation, Isabel could have been worse. Thanks to the work of Hurricane Hunters, weather forecasters accurately predicted the storms path. Many people received warning and fled, or
Hurricane Hunters are a special part of the Air Force. They found out how dangerous Isabel was before it battered the coast. The experienced fliers and scientists gathered information about the size, strength, and path of Isabel.
They sent that information to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The information led officials to evacuate shoreline areas in North Carolina and Virginia. The federal government in Washington, D.C., also shut down.
""Were just doing our part,"" said one Hurricane Hunter. ""We help protect our coast from national disaster.""
The Hurricane Hunters fly WC-130s into the strong winds of hurricanes.
Hurricanes are powerful, whirling storms that form over warm oceans and cause torrential rains and heavy winds. The eye of a hurricane is the calm center of the storm. The
has little wind and few clouds. Swirling around the eye are heavy winds.
Hurricane Hunters fly directly into the eye of a hurricane--not above it. The reason is that a hurricane can extend more than 50,000 feet high, and these planes can fly only as high as 30,000 feet.
of Isabel, crew members experienced a rocky ride. The eye wall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located here.
The plane contains equipment that records weather. In the eye of the storm, Hurricane Hunters released small tubes attached to parachutes. Each tube was about the size of a can of tennis balls. The tubes sent information about wind speed, power, and moisture back to the crew.
As part of their job, Hurricane Hunters help forecasters rate storms. Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5.
A storms rating is based on wind speed and potential for damage. Before hitting land, Isabel was a Category-5 storm. That is the most powerful type.
Satellites in space and other weather instruments are used to measure hurricanes. However, forecasters say that Hurricane Hunters provide the most accurate prediction of the path and strength of a hurricane.
Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings are based on the storms wind and potential for destruction.

805,"The Flordia panther is a protected species.
Do Florida panthers have nine lives? Scientists sure hope so! The wild cats are on the brink of
During the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State.
What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat.
In 1967, Florida panthers were placed on the endangered species list in the United States. The list was created to protect animals that are on the edge of extinction.
Today, wildlife officials are working to keep the wild cats out of
, or danger. Workers have installed fencing along 40 miles of public roads in south-western Florida to prevent panthers from colliding with cars and other vehicles.
Officials are also making efforts to save the land where panthers live from further development. ""We have to protect what's left of their habitat,"" panther expert Bob DeGross told
A panther is about 10 times as large as a house cat. Adult males can weigh up to 150 pounds; females typically weigh about 70 pounds.
Panthers are skilled hunters. They mainly prey on white-tailed deer and wild hogs but will also eat armadillos, raccoons, and even alligators.
Panthers became Florida's official state animal in 1982.
Baby panthers stay with their mothers for about two years, learning to hunt and survive.

574,"New York City schools are removing the junk food from their vending machines.
Change is on the way for vending machines in New York City schools. Beginning in September, candy, soda pop, and other sweet snacks will no longer be offered in school vending machines.
It's not just vending machines that are getting a makeover. In a move to make cafeteria food more healthful, New York City schools will also cut the amount of sugar, fat, and salt in school lunches. That means beef ravioli, potato salad, ice cream, and macaroni and cheese might disappear from lunch trays.
New York City is the largest school system in the country, serving 800,000 lunches daily.
Its lunch menus will eventually contain more healthful, low-fat versions of foods such as chicken nuggets and cheese pizza. Starting this fall, vegetables will be offered five days a week.
New York City is removing the junk food from its 2,400 school vending machines. Take a peek at what can now be found inside.
fruit drinks with less than 100% fruit juice
School officials in New York City hope the changes will help students make more healthful choices. Other school districts around the country are also making similar changes. Some schools are even removing their vending machines.
Many schools use the money from vending machines to pay for sports and other programs. However, health officials say that schools don't need to remove vending machines if they offer more nutritious items in them.
Poor diets and lack of exercise have led to an increase in extremely overweight, or
, kids across the country. Experts say that 15 out of every 100 kids aged 6 to 11 are overweight in the United States.
Another study shows that about 20 out of every 100 third graders and 21 out of every 100 sixth graders in New York City are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.
""We firmly believe that good nutrition plays an essential role in health and development and helps young people to do well in school,"" said the head of New York City's school food service.

552,"For more than 12 years, violent conflict has plagued Azerbaijan (a-zuhr-bigh-JAHN), a country in southwest Asia between Iran and Russia. For much of that time, Azerbaijan has been fighting with neighboring Armenia.
Now Farid Dadashev, age 11, is doing something to stop the fighting.
A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition.
In January, Farid traveled to the United Nations (U.N.) in New York City to talk about how the kids in his country are suffering from the war.
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia.
In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out.
""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told
from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground.""
According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid.
No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace.

702,"Most schoolchildren in the United States can say the words to the Pledge of Allegiance by heart. But the pledge is now in the middle of a debate. At the center of the debate is whether it is right for students to say the pledge in public schools.
Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge is
in public school classrooms. A law is considered unconstitutional if a court decides that it goes against the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional because it includes the phrase ""under God.""
The court says that the phrase suggests that the government

The recent court ruling has angered many people across the country. They see the pledge as a way to express their

Nine western states are part of the court's ruling. Students in those states were ordered to stop saying the pledge. Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington.
However, the ruling has been temporarily put on hold. The Elk Grove School District in California, where the case began, has asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review and overturn the lower court's ruling.

Sally Ride checks in with NASA from the space shuttle in 1983.
How did you feel when you were going into space?
I was unbelievably excited. There is no amusement park ride even close to the experience of flying into space.
What inspired you to become an astronaut?
I was always interested in science from the time that I was in second or third grade. Science was always my favorite subject.
What did it mean to you to be the first U.S. woman to go into space?
It meant a lot to me to be [a] role model ... for young girls who wanted to be astronauts.
Who is the person that supported you the most while you were trying to become an astronaut?
My high school science teacher. She was a good teacher, but what was really important to me is that she helped me build my confidence ... She helped me believe in myself.

Thousands of people visit the tombs every day. Some of Egypts most important rulers from long ago are buried in them. The tomb tours, however, may be hurting the burial sites.
Visitors breath and the heat from their bodies are wearing down the tombs walls, says Zahi Hawass. He is an expert on Egypts past. If things dont change, the tombs could be history. [They] could disappear between 150 and 500 years, Hawass says.
Visitors crowd into a tomb in Egypt.
To protect the treasures, officials are setting up new air systems in the tombs. They are also limiting the number of people who may visit. Some of the burial places will be closed for good. That includes the tomb of the famous boy king Tutankhamen (too-tan-KAH-muhn).
Experts will build a model of Tuts tomb. People can visit that instead. The model will be an exact copyfit for a king.

You may have new homework this year: washing your hands!
Schools are trying to get rid of germsand for good reason. A new type of flu is spreading around the world. Doctors believe about 1 million Americans may have gotten the H1N1
A virus is a type of germ that makes people sick. The H1N1 virus is also called swine flu. It causes
such as fever, cough, and sore throat. Symptoms are signs of a problem.
The virus usually lasts for only a few days. But it spreads very quickly. Since the virus was found last April, it has affected people in more than 150 countries.
School officials dont want the virus to harm students. Some schools will ask ill students to stay home for seven days to make sure they dont get other children sick.
. That is medicine that helps the body fight off germs. Doctors plan to give out the vaccine in the fall.
Until then, you can stay healthy by washing your hands with soap often. It will make a difference, says Cornelia Dekker, a California doctor. Its really going to help a lot if we can keep the virus from spreading.
How does the flu go from me to you to your best friend, Sue? Lets find out.
 When a sick person coughs, tiny drops of virus spray out of his mouth. The drops land on his hands.
 Before washing up, the sick person touches his pals hand. The virus moves to her hand.
 After coming in contact with the germs, she touches her eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus enters her body.
 Flu-like symptoms appear one to four days later. She can leave germs on items she touches, including doors.
In what other ways can schools avoid the H1N1 virus?

Arnesen and Bancroft's trek will last from November to February. They will be crossing during Antarctica's summer months, when the average temperature is 30 degrees below zero!
To complete the trip in 100 days, the women will attach themselves to sails, using the wind to help them ski faster.
In 1994, Arnesen was the first woman to ski to the South Pole. In 1993, Bancroft became the only woman to reach both the North and South poles.

African elephants like to take baths every day. Then, they cover themselves in dirt to keep insects away.
The work scientists are doing at Animal Kingdom may help African elephants in the wild. ""If we can tell individual voices apart, we can keep track of each elephant over time,"" says Savage.

Maine is now the 18th state to enact such a law. The law requires schools to create a plan to prevent and deal with bullying. All adults who work with students must be trained to handle bullying problems.

If you are being bullied, tell the bully in a firm voice that you do not like what he or she is doing.
Find an adult right away, and tell the adult what happened.

Twilight Zone (650 feet to 3,300 feet)
The ocean is colder in the twilight zone. Only dim light reaches this area. Plants cannot grow in this zone. Fewer animals live here than in the sunlit zone. Jelly fish and octopuses are often found here.
Many jellyfish have stinging tentacles. Jellyfish use their tentacles to capture
. Prey are animal that are eaten by predators. Octopuses have suction cups on their tentacles. That helps them hold on to prey.
Midnight Zone (3,300 feet to 19,800 feet)
The midnight zone is dark. It is also very cold. Plants do not grow in this zone. Animals here often have sharp teeth and big jaws. Many animals, such as the ratfish, have large eyes. That helps them see in the dark.
Some animals, such as the deep sea hatchetfish, give off light. Their light blends in with the small amount of sunlight from above. That helps them hide from predators below.

Kings birth home is in Atlanta, Georgia. Here he is at age 6.
In the 1950s and 1960s, King worked to change unfair laws. He led peaceful marches and gave many speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. He said, I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
As a result of Kings hard work, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated fairly and equally.

Robins build nests to lay thier eggs. A robin's nest is made of grass and mud. The mud helps the pieces of grass stick together. The nest is in the shape of a bowl. Robins usually build their nests in trees and shrubs.
A mother robin lays her eggs in the nest. Three to five eggs are laid at one time. The robin eggs are light blue. The mother sits on top of the eggs to keep them safe and warm. Baby robins hatch in about two weeks.
When a robin hatches from its egg, it has no feathers and it is blind. Its parents need to take care of it. The parents bring worms, spiders, and insects for the babies to eat. Baby robins grow up fast. After about two weeks, baby robins will leave their nest.
Why might a mother robin build her nest in a tree or shrub?

Benjamin Franklin was the oldest person to sign the Constitution. At the time, he was 81.
A letter from George Washington was found recently. A 10-year-old girl had saved it in a scrapbook in 1826. The letter was sent to her grandfather, Jacob Morris. The girl lived in New Jersey. Her name was Julia Kean.
Washington wrote the letter in 1787. At that time, he was meeting with other leaders to create the U.S. Constitution. In the letter, Washington wrote that the country's happiness depended on what the leaders decided. Two years later, he became our country's first president.
The letter is important, say history experts. It helps people learn more about our country's past.

Here are answers to common questions about the mysterious moon
Q: Why does the moon seem to glow?
The moon looks like a shining circle of light. It does not give off its own light, though. Like a mirror, it reflects light. Light from the sun makes the moon bright and shiny.
Q: Who was the first person on the moon?

Hammerhead sharks have wide, flat heads. They grow to more than 10 feet long. Hammerheads have triangle-shaped teeth with sharp bumps for chewing food.
Regal angelfish live near safe caves of coral reefs. They are brightly striped fish. Angelfish usually swim in pairs. They eat sea sponges or tiny coral reef animals.
Coral reefs are formed by tiny ocean animals called

The next time you stick on a Band-Aid, you can thank Earle Dickson. He invented the ready-made bandage in 1920. He wanted to help his wife who often cut her fingers while cooking.
At the time, people had to cut pieces of gauze and tape to make bandages. They were hard to use. Dicksons simple idea was a big success. Today, ready-made bandages come in many shapes, sizes, and colors.
Did you know that chocolate chip cookies were a mistake? Ruth Graves Wakefield created them in the 1930s. She was mixing a batch of chocolate cookies and was out of baking chocolate. She decided to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate instead. When the cookies were done, the pieces of chocolate had not melted! They had kept their chip form in each cookie.
Before the 1920s, people often got into traffic accidents. One day, Garrett Morgan saw a bad accident between a car and a horse-drawn carriage. He decided to solve the problem by inventing a traffic signal. It was a pole with signs saying when to stop and go. Todays red, yellow, and green traffic lights are based on Morgans idea.
