4,563,"It took 100,000 people about 20 years to build the Great Pyramid.
It is made of more than 2 million blocks of stone.
Most of the blocks weigh about 6,000 pounds each!
Workers poured water onto the logs so the blocks would roll more easily.
The Earth has many mysteries, or things that are not known or explained. People use science to try to understand those mysteries.
The pyramids are giant tombs, or graves, for Egyptian kings. Pyramids are made of huge stone blocks. Experts know that the Egyptians didn't have the same tools that we have today. So, how were those heavy blocks moved and lifted? Some experts believe that the Egyptians pushed and pulled them into place.
1. Workers cut and shaped the stone into blocks.
2. The workers floated the blocks down the Nile River on big barges.
3. The workers rolled the blocks over logs from the river to the pyramid.
4. The workers built dirt ramps so the blocks could be rolled to the top of the pyramid.
5. Workers carefully fit the stone blocks into place on the pyramid.
No one knows for sure what the dinosaurs looked like. Some experts think that dinosaur skin might have looked and felt like the scaly skin of reptiles today.
Experts study how animals today use skin color to survive. Some animals, like the chameleon, can change skin color in order to hide. Experts also say that other animals, like poison arrow frogs, have brightly colored skin to keep away their enemies.
It is likely that dinosaurs also used skin color to survive, say experts. For example, some experts say that Stegosaurus's plates might have changed color and size to scare its enemies.

5,229,"The map shows some volcanoes located in Mexico.
Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.
Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that
, or melted rock, was rising inside the volcano.
During eruptions, magma can spill out of openings in volcanoes. The hot, flowing magma is called
when it is outside the volcano. When Popo erupted, only heat, gas, and ashes burst out.
After the eruption, the residents were able to return to their homes. But they are watching for future eruptions.
Lava and ash from volcanoes can harm people. What else might these substances harm?
Popo is almost 18,000 feet high. Last Year's eruption was its biggest in 1,200 years.
About 550 volcanoes have erupted on Earth's surface since people began recording history.
A volcano erupts somewhere on Earth about once a week. Not all eruptions are big, however.

6,393,"Casey Martin is a professional golfer. But Martin has a disease that makes walking painful for him. So he would like to ride in a golf cart between shots during golf games.
Members of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) think it would be unfair to let Martin ride in a cart. They say that part of the competition in a golf match is walking the golf course. Some matches last four days, and players walk about 25 miles.
Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether Martin can use a golf cart. The Supreme Court is the most important court in the United States. In January, the justices of the Court listened to what Martin and the PGA had to say about using the golf cart. The Court plans to make a decision by July.

8,189,"You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment?
Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash.
Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water.
Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick.
Every day, about 3,000 kids start smoking.
The average age a kid starts smoking is 13.
About 46 million adults in the United States smoke.
Smoking-related illnesses kill about 500,000 people each year.
Smoking one cigarette takes about seven minutes off the smoker's life.
On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke.
You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.

10,254,"Students raise their voices over green beans.
Lunch is now much tastier at Wright Elementary School in Nevada. The menu changed, thanks to a class of second graders.
The students did not like eating green beans. What did they do about it? They wrote letters to the school's food service.
""The food is great, but there's one problem. The kids don't like green beans,"" wrote one student. Another letter said, ""We love lunch, but we were wondering if you can pretty please change the green beans.""
The food service officials read all the letters. They asked the kids for their help. Read the steps below to see how students changed the lunch menu. Now all the kids can enjoy the new vegetable choices.
How many colors do you eat? Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are healthy. Experts say kids should eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Read the chart to learn more.

11,622,"Our national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Did you know that the song is about a 200-year-old flag? Workers from a museum in Washington, D.C., are trying to make the flag look new again.
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag.
The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches!

time! A harvest is the gathering of food. Many fruits and vegetables are
in the fall. They are fully grown. They are ready to be picked and eaten.
Miller Farms is busy with its fall harvest. The farm is in Platteville, Colorado. It grows many vegetables. Carrots, beets, and onions are just a few of them. David Patterson works on the farm. He told
Kids can visit the farm and pick their own vegetables.
 We pick the vegetables by hand each day. Carrots are kind of tough to pick. You have to loosen them with a shovel first.

17,589,"Every February, we celebrate Presidents' Day. We honor presidents by putting their pictures on money. Whose picture is on the new dollar coin?
New dollar coins showing George Washington will soon be at a bank near you. This month, the
(the place where money is made) began making one-dollar coins that show the faces of our presidents in the order they served in office. The George Washington dollar coin will be first, followed by coins showing John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. Would you rather carry a dollar bill or a dollar coin?
or arguing, about whether the penny should still be made. A penny is worth 1 cent. The U.S. Mint says it costs more to make the penny than the coin is worth. Some people want to keep the penny. They say the coin is a part of American history.

22,342,"Many animals hide in a special way called
Some animals, like chameleons, have skin color that can change. Those animals change their skin color to hide from their enemies. The animal's skin color changes to blend into its setting, such as a tree's bark.
Some animals, like gecko lizards, have colors that match their settings. Those animals use matching color to hide from their enemies. The animal's color matches its setting, such as snow or rock.
Some animals, like katydids, have special body shapes. Their bodies can look like leaves or sticks. The animal's body shape helps it hide from its enemies.
Why might some animals use more than one kind of camouflage?
Some animals, like tigers, have special patterns in their fur that match their settings. The special pattern helps the animal hide from its enemies. The patterns can look like grass. Can you find both tigers in the tall grass?

25,471,"Chaille Stovall is making a movie about the 2000 presidential election. His friend Zac Skipp is helping him. Chaille (pronounced shal-ee) is only 11 years old!
is the name of Chaille Stovall's latest movie. The movie is about the 2000 presidential election. For the movie, Chaille talked to the two main candidates. He talked to Texas Governor George W. Bush at the governor's home. Chaille also traveled with Vice President Al Gore on his campaign bus.
Chaille has been making films since he was 8 years old. Chaille's first movie was
. The movie explored what people think about boy ballet dancers. Chaille won two awards for the movie.
Chaille has also made movies about religion, how kids cope with pain, and musicians.
How did you get started making movies?
. Then people at HBO [a cable TV company] saw it, and they said they wanted to show the film.
How do you decide what your movies will be about?
I just take stuff that's a part of everyday issues.
It's mostly about the 2000 election. The movie asks why a kid should care about politics.
What was it like talking to Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore?
Very surprising. George W. Bush said his daughters weren't so happy with him running in the election because they didn't want to leave their school or stay inside all the time. When I first went to speak to Al Gore in New Hampshire, he knelt down in the snow. It was sort of like he understood children. They both seemed like very nice men.
Filmmakers have their own language. Here are some words they use and their meanings.

--a worker who helps move the scenery and cameras during filming
--a scene that is filmed but is not used in the movie

Earth's temperature is rising, and people are using land where animals live.
are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains.
make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests.
live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live.
live in the grasslands of Asia. Their habitat is shrinking because people are building towns in places that used to belong to the tigers. Now these big cats have fewer grassland areas to call home.
Tigers are among the animals losing places to live.
Scientists say Earth is getting warmer because of pollution in the air. They are working to protect animal habitats.
Take short showers to save water and energy.

28,40,"Experts say that Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. They say that some of the coldest temperatures in the world have been noted in Antarctica. People there wear special clothes to stay warm. But how do animals stay warm in Antarctica?
Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

29,388,"Just where the mighty Amazon, a river located in South America, starts had been a mystery. But a team of explorers has found the answer.
The team says the Amazon begins on a mountain named Nevado Mismi. The mountain is in the country of Peru and is 18,363 feet high. It is part of the Andes mountain range.
Freezing temperatures, strong winds, and rocky land made the mountain trip difficult for the explorers. They traveled by foot, car, bicycle, and even horseback. Even though the trip was hard, the team is happy to have solved the mystery.

30,82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!
Third, Whiskers went with his class to see knights, or soldiers from long ago. Knights wore armor, or metal clothing, for protection. They used shields and swords to fight off enemies.

31,148,"Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe!
In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.

Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.

40,79,"School has changed in some ways over time. Lets learn about those ways.
Schools did not always have computers. How is school today different from school many years ago?
Then: Many schoolhouses had only one classroom. Students of all ages learned together.
Now: Most school buildings have many classrooms. Students in each class are about the same age.
Students listened carefully to a phonograph. That is a machine that plays recordings.
Students use computers during lessons. They wear headphones to listen and learn.
Then: Students raised their hands to answer questions. The teacher called on students to respond.
Now: Students still raise their hands to answer questions. That is one way school has not changed.

45,499,"Some places get wet weather during spring.
Grab your raincoat and boots! Spring is here. That means warmer, rainy weather in some parts of the United States. Read the answers to some questions about wet weather.
A few wet drops land on your head. Its raining! Rain falls from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny bits of water and ice. The bits grow bigger as they join together. Some get so heavy that they fall to the ground. The ice melts if the air is warmer along the way. The raindrops reach the ground as water.
. Those are storms with heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. As lightning strikes, it heats the air around it. That causes the air to
, or get bigger. When that happens, you hear a loud sound called thunder.
When it rains, you may see a rainbow. It appears when sunlight passes through drops of water in the air. The drops break up the sunlight into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Why? Sunlight is always made up of those colors. They look white when they are together. The drops of water separate each color.

48,197,"Some people fly airplanes into hurricanes! That is what Chad Gibson does. He is a member of a group called Hurricane Hunters.
Hurricane Hunters measure the storms wind speed and strength. Scientists use that information to predict when and where a hurricane is going to hit land.
What is it like to fly into a hurricane? There are times when you just see the clouds, says Gibson. You really cant see anything else.
Why might scientists want to predict when hurricanes will hit land?

49,63,"Mount Rushmore is a mountain in South Dakota. The faces of four U.S. presidents are carved on it. Now a special model is being made of Mount Rushmore.
What will make the model so special? It will be shown on a computer in 3-D! That makes pictures look more like the real object, instead of looking flat.
People are making the 3-D model for an important reason. If Mount Rushmore is ever damaged, it will need to be fixed. The 3-D model will show people what the carving looked like.
Mount Rushmore shows the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each face is as tall as a six-story building!
A landmark is a building or place that is special to an area. Americans want to make sure that Mount Rushmore will be here for a long time.

54,400,"Many kids love listening to music on their MP3 players. However, portable music players may not be good for the ears. Health experts say the music players may lead to hearing loss. Why? They send loud sounds straight into the ears. Hearing loss is also more likely if you listen to loud music for hours at a time.
Experts say kids need to give their ears a rest. They warn that at least 12 out of 100 children are at risk of losing some of their hearing.
How do you know if your music is too loud? If you are wearing your earphones, you should be able to hear someone talking to you from a few feet away.
You can also ask friends if they can hear the music from your earphones. If they say yes, turn it down!
What else can you do to protect your hearing?

56,367,"This year, Memorial Day will be celebrated on May 28. On this holiday, we honor the American men and women who have served in past wars. A special animal cemetery in New York honors dogs that helped soldiers in wars.
Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars.
The Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, built a memorial to war dogs in 1923. Since then, the cemetery has held a special ceremony each Memorial Day to honor the dogs.

61,546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.
That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.

65,142,"The U.S. Mint will release the last five state quarters this year!
Many kids are checking their coins for new state quarters. This year, they can complete their collections. The
will release the last five of the 50 state quarters starting this month. The U.S. Mint is the place that makes coins.
The 50 State Quarters Program began in 1999. Since then, the U.S. Mint has made five new state quarters each year. The coins are released to the public in the order in which each state became part of the United States.
The front, or heads side, of each state quarter is the same. They all have a picture of George Washington. He was the first president of the United States. He became president in 1789.
The back, or tails side, of each state quarter is
(yoo-NEEK). That means one of a kind. The design shows something special about that state. ""The program teaches people about the rich history of the states,"" says Michael White. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Mint.
Many kids and adults started collecting coins in 1999 because of the new state quarters. ""It is, by far, the most popular and successful program in U.S. Mint history,"" says White. ""More than 140 million Americans collect them.""
Until 1965, quarters were made of silver. Today, quarters are made of copper and nickel.
New Jersey's quarter has a picture of George Washington on each side.
Coins last for about 30 years. Paper money lasts only about 18 months.
The main office of the U.S. Mint is in Washington, D.C. Offices are also located in five other cities across the United States. Study the map to learn more.
The U.S. Mint in Philadelphia is the largest mint in the world!

It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.

 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.

70,38,"April 22 is Earth Day. On Earth Day, millions of people will think of ways to stop pollution. They will talk about recycling and planting trees. People will look for ways to save energy and water.
People have been celebrating Earth Day since 1970. Earth Day was started by a man named Gaylord Nelson. Nelson was a United States senator from Wisconsin. He was worried about the damage being done to the planet.
To celebrate Earth Day, people get together once a year to think about ways to protect Earth. But many people think that every day should be Earth Day. They say people should always work to to stop pollution and clean up the land and water.
Here are a few ways that you can help make every day Earth Day!
Don't litter! Be a good example for other kids. If you see litter, pick it up and put it in trash cans or recycling bins.
. That means these objects are put through a special process so they can be used again.
Start a can recycling program at your school. Use the money you earn from returning the cans to buy new playground equipment or to have an Earth Day party.
Paper is made from trees. You can save a tree by not wasting paper. Use both sides.
Celebrate National Arbor Day on April 27 by planting a tree. This holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees.
, or save, water. Turn the faucet off while brushing your teeth and washing your face.
Save electricity by turning off the lights when you leave a room. Do not leave a radio or TV on if you aren't using it.

73,386,"In Harlem, a section of New York City, playing hockey and doing well in school go hand in hand.
A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores.

76,376,"Every penny counts at Frankton Elementary School in Frankton, Indiana. Next month, students will take part in a contest called Jar Wars. Kids will drop money into jars. The grade that raises the most money will win a pizza party.
All the money will be donated to help save tropical rain forests. Why? People are cutting down rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of dying out.
Last year, the school raised $891. This year, the goal is to raise even more.
Teacher Ken Kakasuleff came up with the idea for Jar Wars 16 years ago. He says, Earth is our home. We feel proud to protect it.
An area of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil has been destroyed by farmers.

79,465,"Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher.
Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them.
UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia.
Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country?
In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money.
With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables.
One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn.
Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school.
To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are.
Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school.
Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school.
But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children.
UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.

81,75,"A big hurricane hit the United States in 2005. It was called Hurricane Katrina. That hurricane caused a lot of damage to homes and schools in New Orleans, a city in Louisiana.
A new school is opening in New Orleans this fall. It is Langston Hughes Academy Charter School.
John Alford is in charge of the company that is managing the school. It is the first new public school in New Orleans since the storm, he says. We are going to be better than we were before the storm!
John Alford and students in New Orleans are excited about the opening of a new school.

86,256,"Do you have a fire escape plan?
That is the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week. It lasts from October 7 to 13. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) plans the week to teach kids and their families about fire safety.
The NFPA wants to sound the alarm about the need for a home fire escape plan. They want people across the country to practice their fire escape plans this month. The group is calling the project the Great American Fire Drill.
Only one out of four Americans has planned and practiced a fire escape plan, says the NFPA. ""It's important for everyone in your family to know how to escape in case of a fire,"" says NFPA spokesperson Judy Comoletti.
Why is it important to practice a fire escape plan?

90,510,"Goats are helping to prevent forest fires.
Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

The amphibians have not been seen in years. What happened to them? Nobody knows for sure. Some of the animals may be
Something that is extinct is gone completely.
Until recently, the Omaniundu reed frog had not been seen since 1979.
They are at risk of becoming extinct. Loggers cut down the forests where the animals live. They also face other dangers, including pollution and diseases.

95,354,"The United States is having money trouble. It now costs more than a penny to make a penny. A nickel costs nearly 8 cents to make.
Why are those coins so costly? Copper, nickel, and zinc are metals that are going up in price. Copper and zinc are used to make pennies. Nickel and copper are used in nickels.
Some lawmakers want the U.S Mint to use a cheaper metal: steel. It was used in pennies made in 1943, when there wasnt enough copper. You wont see new steel coins just yet. Other lawmakers first have to agree to the plan.
Some lawmakers want to bring back the steel penny.

96,479,"Tornado season has hit the United States. Tornadoes are also known as twisters. They can happen at any time of year. However, they are most common from March to July.
Most tornadoes begin as thunderstorms. Air rises from the ground to the storm clouds. Sometimes that rising air starts to spin. A funnel-shaped cloud can form. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, they can travel across large areas of land. Winds can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour. The storms can destroy everything in their paths.
As a tornado travels across the ground, it picks up anything in its way.

97,359,"Two robots are rolling around Mars. The robots are called rovers. They were sent to Mars in 2004. The U.S. space agency, NASA, sent them there. NASA recently said the rovers will work on Mars for at least two more years.
What are the rovers doing on Mars? They are there to explore the planet and do science experiments. The rovers have been studying the soil and rocks.
People are now learning more about Mars because of the rovers. ""The rovers are amazing machines,"" says NASA spokesperson Alan Stern.

100,247,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.
A black bear hibernates in a den.

101,127,"Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean.
Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean.
Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid.
The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery.
What Does a Giant Squid Look Like?
A giant squid has eight arms and two
. A tentacle is like an arm, except it is much longer.
A giant squid can be 60 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds.
A giant squid has huge eyes, as big as a kid's head.
A giant squid has a beak that looks somewhat like a parrot's beak.
Debra Ingrao works at Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. Last year, Debra flew to New Zealand to bring back a dead giant squid to study. She talked to
I love the ocean and want to learn more about the sea animals living in it.
What do you love most about your job?
I enjoy studying sea animals in their natural habitats. [A
is the place where an animal lives.]
Why is studying the giant squid important?
Everything we learn helps us understand the deep sea better.
Should we be afraid of the giant squid?
Its large size is scary! But giant squids don't live where people swim.
What does a giant squid's skin feel like?
The skin is very smooth and a bit slimy.
Do you want to go on a search for a living giant squid in the future?

104,620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.
 Other animals that live in the Everglades are snakes, turtles, birds, fish, deer, and the rare Florida panther.

106,66,"Hundreds of butterflies will spend the winter in New York City. The butterflies will live in the American Museum of Natural History. The museum has a special room for the butterflies. There are trees, grass, and plants in the room.
Many of the butterflies are from warm rain forests in places like Africa and Asia. So the temperature in the butterfly room is kept at 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Powerful lamps shine down from the ceiling like the sun shines in a rain forest.
Visitors to the museum can walk along a pathway through the special room. The butterflies often land on the visitors. People get a close-up look at the butterflies.

Can you find the dormouse sleeping in the hill?
The dormouse can sleep for six months during the winter. That long sleep is called

109,336,"California Sea Lions live along the west coast of North America. The map shows the west coast of the U.S.
of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers.
San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!
Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out
Experts say the earthquake might have caused
, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore.
Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier.
Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds.
Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour.
Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.
Sea lions eat fish, squid, and octopus. They have about 36 teeth but like to swallow their food whole.
Storm drains in Oxnard, California, usually don't bark. But they do if there is a sea lion stuck inside!
Two kids called the police when they heard barking and saw a sea lion inside a
. (A storm drain is a large pipe that drains rainwater into a lake or ocean.) A rescue team used a large fishing net to free the sea lion. The team spent five hours bringing the 350-pound sea lion out through a manhole.
Rescue workers took the sea lion back to the Pacific Ocean in a truck. They say the sea lion was probably swimming in a local harbor when it entered the drain.

110,459,"Inventing is not just for adults. Kids from across the country recently showed off their great ideas. They took part in a contest to create a new use for Bubble Wrap. Bubble Wrap is a packing material that has air-filled plastic bubbles. It is used to protect objects that are breakable.
Andy Boler, age 10, from Texas, used Bubble Wrap to make a cover for plants. It protects plants from the cold. I like building things that could help people, he says.
Other inventions in the contest included a kite-making kit and a wrist cushion. Some of the kids inventions may be turned into real products.
We have very few rules, says a contest spokesperson. One of the main goals is to get young students thinking.
Here is Andy Boler with his Bubble Wrap invention.

120,56,"NASA slams spacecraft into the moon to look for water.
This drawing shows a spacecraft speeding toward the moon.
Were going to crash! Those arent words NASA scientists usually like to hear. This fall, however, the U.S. space agency crashed spacecraft into the moonon purpose!
On October 9, two spacecraft smashed into Earths neighbor. They created a dent that is 100 feet wide. The big booms were part of a mission to find out whether there is water on the moon.
have found signs of small amounts of water in the moons soil. A satellite is an object that circles something else, such as a planet. Scientists think the moons south pole might have the most water. That part of the moon is almost always cold and in shadow, so the water may be ice.
The two spacecraft aimed for the moons south pole. When they crashed, they kicked up soil. Scientists are studying
, or information, from that soil. It will help them
, or figure out, whether their water guess is right.
Finding water on the moon would make a big splash. Scientists once thought the moon was dry. Having water up there would help astronauts. NASA hopes to set up stations on the moon where astronauts can live. If water were available, they would not have to bring as much of it from Earth.
Water on the moon could also be turned into fuel. That might help NASA power spacecraft headed to explore Mars and other planets.
Scientists are excited about the possibilities. The [spacecraft] returned ... data that will greatly improve our understanding, says Anthony Colaprete. He is a NASA scientist. The team is excited to dive into the data.
Temperatures on the moon can get as low as -400 degrees Fahrenheit. Thats not the moons only cool fact. Read on for more.
Only 12 peopleall Americanshave walked on the moon. The first was Neil Armstrong, in 1969.
Want to wish upon a star? Go to the moon. Stars are always shining, and the sky looks black even during the day.
, or bowl-shaped dents in the ground. The biggest crater on the moon is more than 1,300 miles wide!
Why might scientists want to learn more about outer space?

121,249,"You may see fewer bats flying around this Halloween. Thousands of them are dying in the northeastern United States. Experts dont know why.
. That is a sickness in which white mold-like patches grow on the bats noses, wings, and tails. It was first spotted on bats in New York in 2007. White-nose syndrome has since spread to bats in four other states.
Spooky! Could these bats white noses be making them sick?
, or strange, things. Bats like to fly at night. However, some of the sick bats have been seen taking wing in daylight.
Scientists are not sure whats killing the bats. They are on a mission to learn more. This fall they will journey into some of the bats caves. They will attach radio transmitters to many of the creatures. That will allow scientists to study their movements and body temperatures. They might learn why bats are dying.
Something is killing the bats, and we dont know what it is, scientist Susi von Oettingen told

122,138,"Spiders may not like to eat sweet treats, but they sure know some tricks! Scientists recently learned that certain spiders build
of themselves. A decoy is something used to trick or trap something or someone.
The spiders live in Taiwan. That is part of China, which is a country in Asia. The spiders build the decoys in their webs. They make the fake crawlers to protect themselves from wasps. The spiders use dead insects and other materials to make the decoys. The decoys are about the same size and shape as the spiders.
Spiders may be the only creatures other than humans to make life-size models of their own bodies, according to researchers. Our study seems to be the first to [show] animal-made decoys, scientist I-Min Tso told reporters.
The spiders plan to trick wasps works, researchers say. The insects often think the decoys are real. When wasps attack the fake spiders, the real critters quickly crawl away.
Not even Spider-Man could come up with such a great escape!
A spider hangs out beneath fake spiders.

124,242,"Is your backpack weighing you down? If the answer is yes, you are not the only one. Millions of kids load their backpacks full of heavy books and other supplies. American kids carry an average of 20 pounds on their backs!
Studies show that wearing a heavy backpack can cause back and shoulder injuries later in life. Experts say that kids get more injuries when they wear their backpacks over one shoulder. Wearing both shoulder straps evens out the weight.
Companies are now making backpacks that are better for the back. Some backpacks have wheels so you can pull them. Others have padded neck and back supports. No matter which type you choose, be smart and wear your backpack correctly. Your back will thank you!

125,267,"There will soon be a place in Washington, D.C., fit for a King. U.S. officials recently gave the OK for construction to begin on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial (right). The statue will be built on the National Mall.
King (19291968) was born in Georgia. At that time, people in the southern United States were separated by race. Under the law, black people could not attend the same schools as white people. They also had to use separate public restrooms.
King worked to change the rules in the South. He led peaceful marches and gave speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. Thanks to King and some other leaders, Congress passed
. Those laws make sure that all Americans have equal rights.
Martin Luther King Jr. gives an important speech in Washington, D.C., in 1963.
Officials hope to complete the King memorial in 2011. Christine King Farris is Kings sister. She says the memorial is important because it will remind people of the good work her brother did.

126,788,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters.
Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs.
Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.

130,523,"The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students reading lessons.
, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. He responds in so many ways, teacher Judy Quigley told
Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they dont worry about making mistakes. When you read to people, sometimes they dont really listen, but he always listens, Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told
Students keep Starbucks attention by changing their reading styles during stories. I say it kind of louder so he can hear it, explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesnt work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!

132,194,"Which invention could you not live without? That was a question Americans were recently asked in a survey. The survey gave five choices: the computer, car, cell phone, microwave, and toothbrush. Believe it or not, the toothbrush came in first!
The toothbrush is both the simplest and oldest invention on the list. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. A Chinese emperor made it out of hog bristles and bone.
""The results show that [simple] inventions are important to people,"" said Kristin Joyce, a survey spokesperson. Won't dentists be pleased!

Danny Way, 31, jumped into the record books this summer. He became the first person to leap over the Great Wall of China on a skateboard.
Parts of the Great Wall of China are more than 2,000 years old. The wall is the largest structure ever built. Experts say it is about 4,000 miles long.
Way made the jump using a ramp that he helped build near his home in California. The ramp helped him speed over the wall at nearly 50 miles an hour. That is almost as fast as a car travels on the highway!

135,343,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Does your backpack ever feel as if it's filled with bricks? If so, you are not alone. Many kids tend to overload their backpacks.
A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad
(POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk.
Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert.
What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!

137,186,"Should Native American names and mascots be allowed in college sports?
Football fans cheer as a student rides a horse down the field. The student is dressed as Chief Osceola, a famous leader of the Seminole tribe. In one hand, the student holds a flaming spear. As he throws it into the ground, the crowd goes wild.
Some find Florida State University's mascot doesn't respect the real Chief Osceola.
That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or
after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor.
The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools.
Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture.
Other Native Americans say that teams that use Native American mascots do not honor their culture. They think using those mascots supports
A stereotype is an idea that a group of people is alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers,"" John Sanchez told
. Sanchez is a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe. ""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""

Today, about 1,200 seals live near the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Experts fear that the population will drop in the next five years. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.

141,10,"Railroad tracks connecting Seoul and Pyongyang should be completed in September 2001. Seoul is South Korea's capital. Pyongyang is North Korea's capital.
North Korea and South Korea are two countries in Asia. They have been officially at war for 47 years. Now, however, the countries seem to be making tracks toward peace.
South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.

Penguins called Adlies (ah-DEH-lees) are hunting for
. Krill are tiny, shrimplike animals. This year, there is less krill for the penguins to eat. Scientists say that is because very little winter sea ice formed this year. The ice holds the tiny food the krill eat.
Several million Adlie penguins once lived on the Antarctic Peninsula. By the late 1980s, their numbers decreased by half, scientist Wayne Trivelpiece told
Ice in that area once formed every winter and melted away in the summer. Trivelpiece said that recently winter ice has been ""forming only once every five to six years.""
Many scientists say the disappearing ice is caused by
. That is the slow increase in temperature around the world.
Most scientists say people are partly to blame for global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burn
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth.
""Our research teaches a lesson,"" said Trivelpiece. ""Even a small change in the environment can have a big effect.""
The burning of fossil fuels gives off carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and other gases around Earth trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world. That rise is known as global warming.
How might people reduce their need for fossil fuels?

A total of 10 types of chilies were found. They were found in two caves near Mitla, Mexico. Scientist Linda Perry studied the chilies. She says they were found in good condition.

144,492,"You turn on the TV and see your favorite cartoon character. But wait a minutethats not a show; it is a commercial for junk food!
Cartoon characters are being used to sell junk foods on TV. How does that affect you?
Thats wrong, says the Institute of Medicine, which advises the nation on health issues. The group says that kid-friendly characters should promote only foods that are good for you.
The group recently reported that food ads on TV have astrong influence on what kids under the age of 12 eat. ""Our eating habits and preferences form early in our lives,"" the groups spokesperson, Christine Stencel, told
Advertisers know kids have spending power. ""American kids spend about $200 billion each year. Foods high in sugar and fat are among the top 10 items,"" says Stencel. ""Kids also influence what their parents buy.""
Junk foods such as candy bars, sugared cereals, and potato chips are high in
A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy a food can provide. The body needs food as fuel. However, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity.
Millions of people in the United States are
or severely overweight. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems.
""The committee thinks it is time people should take steps to reduce the problem of obesity,"" says Stencel. ""That includes making changes in what foods are marketed to kids and how they are promoted.""
Foods that are high in nutrition help people stay healthy. Good choices:
foods with whole grains, such as whole-wheat breads and pastas
a variety of fruits and vegetables in a rainbow of colors
calcium-rich, nonfat or low-fat foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
What are some other ways advertisers get kids to buy their products?

A team of scientists there made a discovery. The underwater volcano the experts were studying had recently
To erupt is to blow up. Whats more, they had guessed it would happen.
Courtesy of Bill Chadwick/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Scientists use a robot to study lava near the volcano.
The spewer is called Axial Seamount. It rests at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The peak is about 250 miles from Oregon.
Scientists have been watching changes in the volcanos activity. Based on those changes, they decided that Axial Seamount would erupt. They said it would happen by 2014.
Researchers recently sent a robot down to the volcano to take pictures. They saw that the area was covered in lava. Scientists say the spewer erupted in April.
Experts hope the volcanos rumbles will help them learn more about underwater spewers, explains scientist Bill Chadwick.

147,689,"Some projects take longer than others. The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota is one of them. Workers started carving the giant rock sculpture in 1948. They are still working on it today.
The memorial honors Chief Crazy Horse. Native American leaders chose to honor him because he was one of their heroes. Chief Crazy Horse was a Native American who fought for his people's right to their land and traditions.

151,642,"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of GaHoole
dont look like cartoonsthey look like real owls! That was the goal of Grant Freckelton and Simon Whiteley. They are
who worked on the new movie. An animator creates art for movies.
student reporter Jackson Brantley talked with the animators.
Jackson Brantley: What is your favorite part of the movie?
We like [the] cool owls that have helmets and battle gear.
JB: How did you create the characters?
[We found photographs of] real owls. We [changed each owl] enough so that it [showed] what the character is like. We tried to make [the main character] sort of wide-eyed.
JB: What do you love most about your job?
I cant think of probably anything better than making movies, because you get to dream and then create your dreams.

152,602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.
So the saying ""Kindness is its own reward"" may not be true just for humans.
Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.
The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa.
uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa.
The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia.
is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa.
What does the expression ""Kindness is its own reward"" mean?

153,264,"Why do some plants and animals die out?
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water.
The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city.
The gates would take about ten years to complete. If the plan is a success, Venice will be saved from being swallowed by the sea.

155,143,"Scientists are teaching whooping cranes to fly south.
Dressed in a white costume, scientist Joe Duff pretends to be a whooping crane. He may look silly, but he has an important job to do. Duff is training a flock of whooping crane chicks in Wisconsin to think he is their mother. ""It's like becoming a bird yourself,"" he told
Joe Duff is the team leader of a group called Operation Migration. Members have been teaching ""whoopers"" to
to Florida since 2001. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called
. Each aircraft is flown by a pilot in a whooping crane costume. In six months, the birds will be ready to follow the aircraft and migrate to Florida for the winter.
The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.
Joe Duff spends a lot of time pretending to be a whooping crane. If you could be any animal, what would you be? Why?

156,328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

158,746,"A boy pens a butterfly book and helps animals.
Erik Uebelacker has caught the writing bug! It all began in the second grade. Thats when the student from Bel Air, Maryland, learned a fun fact about butterflies.
They taste with their feet, Erik told
I was surprised when I heard that, so I decided to [write about it].
Write he did. Today, Erik, 10, is the author of a book. The book is called
The fifth grader has sold more than 700 copies of his book. Erik has donated the $3,100 in
he made to a wildlife group that protects endangered animals. Profits are earnings.
Because of his efforts, Erik was recently chosen as one of the top kid volunteers in the country. He was picked by an awards program. It is called the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.
Erik became interested in butterflies funny feet in science class. He learned that the fliers have taste
in their feet. An organ is a body part. When the butterflies stand on leaves, their feet taste them. If the leaves taste good, the critters will lay their eggs on them.
In Eriks book, butterflies that wear shoes taste only shoes. Everything might taste like dirty socks to them, he explains.
or print, another book. If he does, the young writer says, he will continue to give away his earnings. My favorite part about writing is donating the money ... to a good cause, Erik says. I just feel inspired.
What cool tricks do butterflies have up their wings? Read to learn more about the critters.
Butterflies can see green, red, and yellow. They can also spot things humans cant, such as patterns on flowers.
Butterflies may look colorful, but parts of their wings are clear. The wings are covered in scales.
Some butterfly species can fly to heights of 10,000 feet. Most species fly about 12 miles per hour.
Why might some people want to donate money instead of keeping it for themselves?

for the rest of the school year. Pen pals are friends who keep in touch by writing letters.
A few days after meeting their new pen pals, the soldiers left for Iraq. That is a country in a part of Asia called the Middle East.
The soldiers from Fort Lewis are part of the 140,000 U.S. troops serving in Iraq. They are working to help bring
to that country. A democracy is a type of government in which people choose their leader. The United States is a democracy.
Iraq's previous leader, Saddam Hussein, was a
. A dictator is a ruler who has complete control over the country. Saddam ruled Iraq from 1979 until 2003.
With the help of teachers, students will send letters to the Fort Lewis soldiers in Iraq once a month. They will also send care packages for the holidays.
""We wanted to support our troops,"" teacher's aide Bev McDonald told
. ""The pen pal project will give the soldiers something to look forward to.""

160,313,"Finding a bug in your dinner is usually a bad thingunless you like your meals hot!
Scientists in Bolivia recently figured out that bugs help make some chili peppers spicy. Bolivia is a country in South America.
Certain types of bugs can poke holes in a chili peppers skin. That leaves the pepper open to becoming

168,553,"The King memorial takes shape on the National Mall.
A piece of the nation's capital will honor an important leaderDr. Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial for King is being built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It will be the first memorial on the Mall to honor an African American.
A ceremony was held on November 13 to mark the start of construction. President George W. Bush and other leaders were among the thousands of people who gathered for the event.
""When the work is done, the King memorial will be a fitting tributepowerful and hopeful and poeticlike the man it honors,"" Bush said at the ceremony.
If all goes as planned, the memorial will be finished in 2008. It will have trees, flowing water, and a 30-foot statue of King. Quotes from King's speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
King (19291968) grew up in the U.S. South. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people. They were forced to sit in the backseats of buses. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
King worked to change the laws by giving speeches and leading peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders,
were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated equally.
On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. A crowd of more than 200,000 people came to hear him. In his speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""

169,80,"Scientists go to great lengths to copy the world's tallest trees.
Tree climbers at Roy's Redwoods Open Space Preserve in California have a huge job! They are climbing redwoods more than 200 feet tall to snip cuttings from the trees' highest branches. Some
, or tree experts, say those cuttings may help
Redwoods are some of the tallest trees in the world. They can grow more than 300 feet tall and live for more than 2,000 years. However, many redwood forests have been cut down. Only 5 percent of forests with the oldest redwood trees are left.
David Milarch of Champion Tree Project International wants to change that. He has launched a campaign to
redwoods so new forests can be planted. To clone is to copy
. Genetic material is information inside living creatures. It determines features, such as size and height.
Milarch and his team want to clone the oldest, tallest redwoods. So far, the team has collected 900 cuttings from three redwoods in California. Arborists put them in a special nursery to grow. After a few years, the cuttings will be ready for planting.
Some of those young trees will stay in California, but Milarch also wants to send the cloned trees all over the world. ""[The forests] can be a model for the world,"" he told
. ""We've made terrible mistakes by cutting down forests ... and we're going to go back and try to fix it.""
Trees don't have diaries, but they do keep good records. Each ring in a tree's trunk represents a year of growth. The more rain that fell during the year, the wider the ring is.
What are some other ways people can protect trees?

172,28,"Too much chocolate may be unhealthy for you, but researchers have found a way to make the treat good for the environment.
This veggie vehicle can reach 135 miles per hour!
in England are using chocolate to power the worlds first Earth-friendly race car. An engineer is a person who designs and builds things. England is a country in Europe.
The vehicle is named WorldFirst. Engineers built the car with
parts. Something that is renewable can be used again.
WorldFirst can run on fuel made from chocolate and vegetable oils. The car zooms from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds.
The fuel isnt the only part of the car that can be bought at a grocery store. WorldFirsts steering wheel is partly made from carrots and other vegetables. The cars mirrors are part potato, and the seat is made with soybean oil. Does that sound nutty? You bet! WorldFirsts brakes will be made with cashews.

173,365,"Taylor Momsen is the actress who plays
in the movie version of the Dr. Seuss story ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" Taylor wanted to adopt the dog that played Max in the movie. But Taylor's parents would not let her have a pet.
Instead, Taylor decided to help dogs in her hometown, St. Louis, Missouri. She learned that the Humane Society, a group that cares for homeless pets, needed towels to keep animals dry and warm. Taylor collected 100 towels, sheets, and blankets in her neighborhood to donate to the Humane Society.

174,454,"Ten-year-old Hunter York found a most unusual creature in his father's backyard. It was a snake with two heads! It ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" said Hunter.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8-inch
. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Not all reptiles crawl on their bellies the way snakes do. Turtles and lizards are reptiles that creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad gave the two-headed reptile to a snake expert because they could not get it to eat. ""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.

179,552,"Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide!
Scientists arent quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea.
The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets.
The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

180,306,"The Exxon Valdez oil spill was one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history
One of the worst oil spills in U.S. history happened in Prince William Sound, off the coast of Alaska. On March 24, 1989, the oil tanker
hit some rocks. The damaged ship spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into the water.
Oil polluted about 1,000 miles of Alaskan coastline. Many kinds of animals, such as seals, killer whales, ducks, otters, and fish, died because of the spill.

184,563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.
Recently, Hubble took a photo of the Cone Nebula. A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nearby hot stars cause the Cone Nebula to glow red.

185,665,"Step aside, Spider-Man! Scientists recently invented a glue that works like geckos' feet. Geckos are little lizards that can scurry up walls. Their feet are lined with millions of tiny hairs that can
on to a surface. To latch is to grab. The new glue is made with millions of tiny plastic fibers. The fibers grab hold as they slide across things. Like gecko feet, the glue releases easily. It doesn't leave a sticky film behind either. Scientist Ron Fearing helped create the glue. He compares it to how a toothbrush works. ""If I tap [a toothbrush] lightly against a surface, a few bristles will make contact,"" he says. ""But if I rub the toothbrush across the surface, the bristles bend and make ... more contact."" Scientists say that their research could be used to make gloves that would allow people to climb walls!

186,244,"Scientists are rushing to uncover and protect ruins of some very old cities. Those scientists have found lost cities in Asia and Africa that are more than 2,000 years old!
Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

187,173,"Talk about having all the right moves! In
, a tap-dancing penguin named Mumble tries to get his son to enjoy dancing.
Wade Robson lent his fancy footwork to the film, which hits theaters November 18. A choreographer creates the steps in a dance.
student reporter Bella Fletcher recently spoke with the man behind Mumbles moves.
Bella Fletcher: How do you create dances for animated characters?
You actually get to work with human dancers. ... The movements that the humans are doing are [used to create the movements of] the animated characters.
BF: What was the hardest part of making the dances?
There are always hundreds and hundreds of penguins [in a scene], but we only have 15 dancers. ... So I would have to imagine how a scene [would] look with hundreds and hundreds of penguins, but just create it with 15 [people].
[I like] Atticus, whos ... a chubby little rapper penguin. ... I actually played Atticus in the [first dance scene].

188,221,"Your used wrappers and empty boxes could be more than just garbage. The items could help people in need. Inventor Max Wallack can prove it.
The 12-year-old student from Massachusetts recently invented the Home Dome. It is a small
, or building. It is made of garbage such as plastic, wire, and packing peanuts. The structure could provide shelter for homeless people.
Maxs invention helped him win the grand prize in the Trash to Treasure contest. That is a nationwide contest for kids. It is organized by the PBS television program
As part of his prize, the inventor met some designers. Together, they built a
of the Home Dome. A prototype is a model.
Max has wanted to help homeless people since he was a little kid. He hopes they can use his creation. I always thought of ways to help the [homeless], he told

? A scavenger is an animal that feeds on dead animals.
For years, scientists have been debating that question. Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides.
""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit.
Scientists once believed that T. rex was a fast runner. But recent studies have shown that might not be true. Horner says that
was not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food.
means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler.""
Other scientists don't agree with Horner. They argue that
wasn't fast, they say, it could have hunted slower dinosaurs. Scientists also say that
did not need its arms to hunt. Animals without arms, such as sharks and snakes, hunt prey.
have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?
Why is it important to study both sides of an argument?

194,640,"Lily Thorpe from Colorado is one busy 11-year-old! She recently started a group called Kids Campaign. Lily meets with
and speaks with them about kids' causes. (Elected officials are people who are voted into office.)
Why did Lily start Kids Campaign? She noticed that many of her school library books were very old. To help schools in Colorado get money for books and other supplies they need, she decided to take action.
In the name of children everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard. ""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told

195,100,"Overfishing and melting ice spell trouble for penguins.
Life is good for penguins in Antarctica at the end of the movie
Real-life penguins, though, have little to celebrate.
Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming
or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.
""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told
Her wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins.
Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""We can and must reduce gas emissions to keep penguins safe in the future,"" says Siegel.
What can people do to reduce their use of fossil fuels?

Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items such as hats, combs, and headphones.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.

Welcome to the city of ice! Beginning January 5, the city of Harbin in northeastern China
or changes, into a winter wonderland. The ice festival is a popular tourist attraction. It has been drawing crowds for 33 years. Organizers expect millions of visitors to pour into the citys parks this year. There, they will see hundreds of snow sculptures and some huge buildings made with bricks of ice.
Harbin is the coldest city in China. The temperature in the city is below freezing for more than six months of the year. (The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.) In Harbin, the temperature can fall below zero. That gives people there a great
or chance, to build with tons of snow and ice. In fact, they use enough snow and ice to fill 90 large swimming pools!
In December, 3,000 workers began creating the winter amusement park. They carved giant castles, friendly dragons, slippery slides, and even working restaurants out of ice. Some of the buildings and sculptures have colorful lights that are lit up at night.
Many of the ice sculptures are made by teams of artists from around the world. When visitors come to look at the creations, they have to watch their step. Not only are the buildings made of ice, but so are many of the walkways and railings!
The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past.
What kind of sculpture or building would you like to see built out of ice? Why?

203,633,"Many kids say good-bye to a favorite part of the school day.
Imagine if recess were no longer part of your school day. If you are like most kids, you are probably thinking, ""No recess? No way!"" However, some students have no choice. For them, recess is over.
Clark County School District in Nevada recently put an end to recess. It is one of many school districts across the country to get rid of recess time. Why? School officials say they want students to have more time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on tests.
Should schools stop having recess? Why or why not?
Many teachers, parents, and students do not agree with the decision to
, or take away, recess. ""Recess is important so kids get a break from sitting at their desks,"" said one principal from Virginia. ""They get up and move. They can visit with their friends and have social time.""
Many experts say that having recess is worth the lost class time. Recess gives kids the chance to exercise. At recess, many students also learn how to play and work together with other students. Some studies even show a recess break can help improve test scores.
""If we had a longer school day, we would love to have recess,"" said one school official. ""But we have more math to teach and more reading to do, and something had to go.""
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess break? Don't worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving:

were discovered in 1998 in South America. Fossils are ancient remains of plants or animals. Scientists spent almost six years cleaning the bones and putting them together.

211,464,"Scientists find great surprises in the Great Barrier Reef.
Brightly colored fish dart in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. That is a
a continent. A coral reef is a large underwater structure full of plants and animals. Coral is made of tiny sea animals called
. When polyps die, their hard shells become part of the reef.
Scientists recently explored the worlds largest coral reef. They also looked at another reef near Australia. Their search turned up hundreds of animal species. Some of the species may have never been seen before.
Scientists used netted bags to search the reef. They spied big-clawed shrimp and worms shaped like pine trees. They also found about 130 new types of soft coral.
The researchers left behind 36 plastic houses on the ocean floor. The scientists hope the creatures will move into the houses. That will make it easier to study them.
Learning about the creatures may help people protect them. One-third of the worlds coral reefs are threatened by pollution and fishing. Its important to find out whats in the Great Barrier Reef, says scientist Patricia Hendriks. She took part in the
, or trip with a specific goal. If we dont know what is present in the first place, how are we ever going to protect it properly?
What species did scientists spy in the Great Barrier Reef? Here are a few that made a splash.
This green-banded snapping shrimp has a large claw on one side. It looks like a tiny lobster.
This Christmas tree worm rests on a coral reef. It uses its branches to breathe and eat.
The cuttlefish is a boneless animal related to squid. It has eight arms that it uses to catch food.
This gorgonian fan won the hearts of researchers. The soft coral fan stretches more than 3 feet tall.
In what ways can people help protect the Great Barrier Reef?

212,139,"If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
Fish may be a rare sight by 2048. That is what a team of scientists predicted after making a four-year study. They say ocean life is being wiped out by pollution and too much fishing.
The loss of ocean life will mean less food. It will also affect the balance of the oceans ecosystem, say the scientists. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals and the environment working as a unit to live.

213,505,"The 2010 census is on its way to your mailbox.
How high can you count? U.S. officials are about to count to more than 300 million!
is ready to go. A census is an official count of every person who lives in a country. The United States polls its population every 10 years.
or running, a census isnt as easy as 1-2-3. In a few weeks, every household will receive a survey. The survey asks about peoples ages, races, and living situations. People must mail the form back to the government by April 1. Thousands of census workers will go door-to-door to make sure everyone takes part.
Once the forms are in, workers will crunch the numbers. Adding up the results will take monthseven with special machines that can sort thousands of surveys an hour. The data has to be finished by December 31. On that day, census workers will
the results to U.S. President Barack Obama. To deliver is to bring.
Workers pass out census information in Minnesota.
The numbers could add up to big changes. They could affect the U.S. House of Representatives. A states representation in the House is based on population. If a states population has changed, the number of representatives that state has may change too. The data could also affect how much money states, towns, and schools get from the government.
Thats why officials want to count all U.S. residents, says Robert Groves. He is in charge of the census. The most important thing is [to] fill it out and mail it back because that makes the census a great success, he told
So check the mail. The census surveys will be on their way soonyou can count on it!
In 1790, Congress made a new lawthe U.S. population had to be counted, and fast! Workers visited every house in the country. They counted about 3.9 million people. That number didnt wow President George Washington. He expected more people!
Washington would probably be happier with todays totals. Heres a look at the first and most recent censuses.
Is it important to know how many people live in the United States? Why?

By third grade, many kids know how to type on a keyboard. That has some handwriting experts worried. They are afraid that computers will replace cursive writing in the future.
""[The kids have] good handwriting now, and they love cursive,"" said one teacher from California. ""But it wouldn't surprise me if they just walked around with their little keyboards and typed everything a few years from now.""
Third grade is the year when most kids learn how to write in cursive. However, many kids like Aubrie say they would rather type than write in cursive. ""Computers are better. [They don't] make my hand cramp up as much,"" said Aubrie.
No one knows what will become of cursive writing. In the meantime, keep practicing. For the time being, it seems that cursive is sticking around.

221,19,"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses
vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.)
The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message.

222,400,"A reward is being offered for toy ducks washing ashore.
Little rubber ducks, turtles, beavers, and frogs have been on a long journey. Hundreds have washed up on shore in recent years.
In 1992, boxes of the toys fell off a ship in the Pacific Ocean. The toys made their way to the Arctic Ocean. For years, they were trapped there by ice. Recently, the toys have floated toward the Atlantic Ocean.
With the help of computers, scientists can predict where the toys are heading. Scientists believe many of the lost toys will wash up on the northeast coast of the United States.
on them. That is the name of the company that made them. The company is offering a $100 U.S. savings bond to anyone who finds a lost toy.
The rewards are being offered in the name of science. The toys are helping scientists track the patterns of
. An ocean current is a flow of water in the ocean.
Each year, about 10,000 shipments fall overboard. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said one ocean expert. ""It just goes somewhere else.""
Some trash gets eaten by ocean creatures and birds that mistake it for food. Other trash washes up on shore.
What effect might trash have on ocean creatures?
The story of the bath toys is helping to make people aware of the ocean trash problem. ""You can learn a lot from a [rubber] duck on a beach,"" said the ocean expert.

snakes. The fossils include backbones and ribs. The scientists plan to return to Colombia to look for more bones.
Experts also hope to learn whatand how much

It could easily eat something the size of a cow, Conrad explains. A human would just be toast.

224,340,"New NASA projects get ready to take flight.
Get ready for a birthday party thats out of this world. NASA turns 50 on October 1! The U.S. space agency has a lot to celebrate. NASA was
, or started, in 1958. Since then, the agency has
, or sent, more than 250 astronauts into space. The agency has also created robot spacecraft to explore
, or faraway, planets. There are even U.S. astronauts living and working in space on the International Space Station.
NASA officials have big plans for the next 50 years too. They plan to send humans back to the moon by 2020. U.S. astronauts first visited the moon in 1969. They stayed less than a day. This time, astronauts will live on the moon for up to six months.
NASA is designing a new spacecraft to carry the astronauts to the moon. Scientists are also redesigning the space suit. They say astronauts will need lighter suits for exploring.
Scientists hope that the moon mission will lead to an even bigger trip. NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars! The space agency has sent robot spacecraft called
to explore the Red Planet. NASA will send a new rover to Mars next fall.
Scientists want to determine whether Mars could have supported life at one time. They hope astronauts will one day be able to answer that question themselves.
Were trying to [go to Mars] as early as 2035, Jeff Hanley of NASA told
. Maybe someday in the far, far future [humans will reach] the stars.
NASAs history is a blast from the past! Read the time line to learn some important firsts in U.S. space travel and exploration.
U.S. astronaut Alan Shepard is the first American in space.
Americans become the first people to walk on the moon.
The International Space Station is under construction. It should be finished by 2010.
How would visiting Mars be different from visiting the moon? Why?

225,254,"Scientists in Greenland are going ducky over their latest experiment. Theyre using toy ducks to study ice! Greenland is a large island in Europe. It is near the North Pole.
The scientists recently set loose 90 rubber ducks in the Jakobshavn (yah-cuhb-SAH-ven) Glacier on Greenland. A glacier is a large sheet of ice that moves slowly over land. Scientists dropped the ducks into tunnels in the glacier called
Melting ice on the glacier flows into the moulins. Some experts say
is causing the ice to melt. Global warming is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Where the water ends up is a mystery. Thats where the ducks come in. Scientists have labeled the toys with an e-mail address. They hope fishing crews will find the ducks and contact them. That will help scientists learn where the melting water travels.
Scientist Alberto Behar is waiting to hear some of the duck tales.
We havent heard back, but it may take ... time, he told reporters.

226,37,"New species are taking over the Great Lakes.
The Great Lakes have a great big problem. Theyre under attack! Odd creatures from faraway places are moving in and taking over.
. Invasive species are animals or plants that get moved to a new place and harm the people, animals, or plants that live there.
Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes block pipes that people depend on for water. Sea lampreys kill the lakes fish. Those and other invasive species are putting the areas 3,500 types of
plants and animals in danger. Something that is native has always lived in that part of the world.
Even more trouble is on the way, scientists say. U.S. researchers recently found 28 species in the lakes that could become
That worries scientist Vic Serveiss, who helped with the research. Invasive species ... compete for the same food ... as the native species, he told
. Many times [they] are more successful ... than the native species.
Some invasive species enter the lakes on ships from other places. Some ships carry water in tanks for balance. That water is called
. When the ships arrive at the Great Lakes, they dump the ballast water. Any species in that water end up in the lakes.
Its important to stop new invasive species from entering, says Tim Eder of the Great Lakes Commission. That group helps protect the lakes. Were trying to get Congress to pass new laws to require ships ... to clean [their] tanks before they release water into the lakes, he says.

The Great Lakes make up the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. They cover more than 94,000 square miles.
More than 40 million people rely on the lakes for water. About 350 species of fish live in the lakes.
Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes. It is about one-fourth the size of Lake Superior, the largest lake.
Why might getting rid of invasive species in the Great Lakes be hard?

227,161,"Is fast food part of your diet?
Are potato chips, soft drinks, and cookies part of your diet? If you're like many kids, the answer is yes. Health experts say that Americans are eating too much junk food. It makes up almost one-quarter of the American diet!
The U.S. government is helping people change their eating habits. More than half of Americans are overweight. Being overweight can lead to health problems.
In a recent report, the government said people should eat foods that are higher in
and lower in fat. Nutrients give you energy and help your body stay healthy. Some foods that are good sources of nutrients are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, such as brown rice and whole-wheat bread.
Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty!
A healthful diet is not the only way people can keep their bodies fit. The new guidelines say kids should exercise for at least one hour a day.
If you think eating healthful foods is boring, think again! Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty. Just ask the kids at Meadowbrook Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas. They recently taste-tested foods, such as sweet potato pancakes and blueberry burgers.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture held the taste test. That group wants to help schools find ways to serve healthful foods and meet the new dietary guidelines.
""These new dietary guidelines represent our best ... advice to help Americans live healthier and longer lives,"" said one government official.
Experts say that kids are eating too much sugar. If you look at a food label, you might have trouble spotting the sugar. That's because sugar can have many different names. Here are some of them:

228,625,"NASA shuttles have blasted spacecraft to far-off planets. They have even helped build a floating space lab. Now, the shuttles are ready for a new mission: their final countdown.
Officials at the U.S. space agency are ending the shuttle program this summer. The shuttle
will shoot for the stars one more time this month. Then
will make its last flight in June.
The program took off in 1981 when NASA sent
to space. NASA built five shuttles in all. The others were
. Each spacecraft could carry up to 10 astronauts. The shuttles could spend about two weeks in space at a time.
One of the shuttles most important jobs has been helping astronauts build the International Space Station. That is a lab that
Earth. To orbit is to circle. The shuttles
astronauts to the lab. To ferry is to carry. Scientists from many nations run tests at the lab.
The missions arent cheap, though. One trip to space costs about $450 million. To save money, the U.S. government will now send astronauts to the lab on shuttles owned by private companies.
The new plan will allow NASA to focus on a mission thats really out of this world. Space officials want to send astronauts to Mars. Scientists have used
, or robotic spacecraft, to explore the Red Planet, but humans have never set foot there.
Officials hope that changes soon. Were looking to send human missions to Mars, Allard Beutel told
He is a NASA spokesperson. These [changes] are the early steps ... to get us there.
These astronauts accomplishments launched them into history books.

229,114,"Mars is about to become a busy place. Recently, the U.S. space agency, NASA, announced plans to send six spacecraft to Mars in the next ten years. Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when
landed on Mars. Millions of people on Earth watched as it's tiny rover, Sojourner, wandered over the planet's surface.
Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.
A person who weighs 50 pounds on Earth would weigh 19 pounds on Mars.

231,79,"Floodwater recently exploded from Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona. The water gushed down the Colorado River and into the Grand Canyon. A
is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side.
Scientists released water from the dam to move 1 million tons of
down the Colorado River. Sediment is sand and soil carried by water. Scientists hope the sediment will collect on beaches and
to save endangered fish and plants. Sandbars are ridges of sand formed by moving water.
Glen Canyon Dam is a wall that people built across the Colorado River. It was made to store water and generate electricity. When it began operating in 1963, it stopped the flow of river water and most of the sediment.
Glen Canyon Dam is located in Arizona.
Without new sediment, beaches and sandbars started washing away. Plants growing along the beaches began to die off. Many young fish that depend on sandbars to survive started to die off too.
During the next two years, scientists will study the effects of the flooding. ""The Grand Canyon is one of the unique natural areas in the world,"" scientist Denny Fenn told
. ""It deserves protection. Anything we can do to save it, the better off we'll be.""

(an-TE-nee)! Those are organs that help butterflies smell and find food. But thats not all they do.
Butterfly: AP Images; Antenna: Photo Researchers, Inc.
This is what a butterflys antenna looks like close-up.
A new study shows that antennae help monarchs find their way during
That is the movement from one place to another when the seasons change. Every fall, millions of monarchs fly from Canada and the United States to Mexico.
The insects use the sun to make their way south. Their antennae track the suns location. That helps the butterflies stay on the right path.
Butterflies without antennae dont fly in the correct direction, Steven Reppert told
. He was the leader of the study. That was a real surprise to us.

236,730,"Adara Claphan (below) has a gift for music. Now shes sharing that gift with others. The fifth grader from Wichita, Kansas, is raising money to donate guitars to kids in Nicaragua. That is a country in Central America.
Adara began taking guitar lessons last year. Music is a part of life, she told
Recently, the music maker learned about a
called HeartStrings. A charity is an aid group. The organization raises money to send guitars to kids in countries where many people are poor, such as Nicaragua.
After hearing that, Adara came up with a plan to help. She began selling necklaces and earrings for $5 each. Before long, the student had raised enough money to donate her first guitar.
Adara hopes to send about 10 more guitars to Nicaragua. She says helping other kids feels great. Im putting music into their lives, she says.

237,526,"What is colorful, plastic, and nearly 100 feet tall? The worlds tallest LEGO tower!
, or built, in Vienna, Austria. Austria is a country in Europe. The plastic creation broke the
world record for the tallest LEGO building. Something that is previous came before.
The tower was made up of about 460,000 LEGOs. More than 3,000 people helped build it in four days.
Most of the builders were children. Each young helper made a part of the tower. The designs were different, says LEGO spokesperson Kate Sutch. Some kids built their sections in patterns.
Breaking the record feels amazing, Sutch told

239,304,"One of the worlds oldest birds may not be a bird after all!
A new dinosaur discovery is making scientists take a closer look at
(ahr-kee-AHP-teh-rikss). That creature lived about 150 million years ago. Researchers thought it was one of the first birds on Earth.

241,327,"Watch out, Spider-Man. You may soon have company. The superhero's powers might someday become more than comic-book science fiction.
Researchers from England say that people may actually be able to scale walls and climb ceilings with gloves made of a special material. However, the researchers who came up with the material didn't get the idea from wall-crawling spiders.
Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
. Geckos are little lizards that use their sticky feet to cling to walls and ceilings. They can climb the most slippery glass surfaces and dangle from the ceiling with a single toe.
What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling.
""If human palms were covered by this [sticky] material, it would support the weight of an average human,"" said one scientist.
Scientists hope the material can be used with robots or in medicine. But they have a way to go before turning their idea into reality. The material is expensive, and it quickly loses its stickiness. Spider-Man would not be pleased to hear that!

243,240,"Could you keep quiet for one day? How about for a month or a year? That's what Brett Banfe is doing. The 18-year-old believes that silence is golden, and he has promised not to utter a single sound for an entire year.
Brett is remaining silent to raise money for charity. He came up with the idea when he was talking to several friends. ""We were talking about what it would be like to stop speaking for a day,"" he explained. ""And I said I could do it for a year.""
Brett says zipping his lips will change the way he listens to people ""because I'm not going to be trying to think about what I'm going to say next,"" he explained.

244,294,"A sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

Tom Lawson, a truck driver, was cruising on Interstate 8 in Arizona recently when he saw a ""green light with a kind of orange tail going [through the] sky.""
People more than 100 miles away saw the bright light. Most observers didn't know what had caused the flash. Some thought they had seen a strange new airplane or even a flying saucer.
Frank So, an astronomer, is fairly sure he knows what caused the flash. ""From the description, it sounds like a very bright meteor,"" said So, who works at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. California.

First start at the end of your string and mark off seven foot lengths:
Now use the string to measure these body parts. Have a friend help. Be sure to measure from one black mark on the string to the next.

247,25,"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny.
The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.
Be creative, use your imagination, and have a good sense of humor!

248,601,"Mount Rushmore is getting a cleaning for the first time in its 65-year history. Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidentsGeorge Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces.
To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt.
""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told
. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says.
The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome.
Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building.
Four presidents were carved into Mount Rushmore because they symbolized courage and freedom during the first 150 years of American history.
(1732-1799), the first U.S. president, led the American colonies to freedom during the Revolutionary War (1775-1783)
(1743-1826), the third president, helped write the Declaration of Independence.
(1809-1865), the 16th president, held office during the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) between the North and South.
(1858-1919), the 26th president, was a champion of the environment. He founded the first national parkYellowstone.

249,188,"When I stepped inside the old Mission Control room at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, I felt like a kid again. Even though the computers had long been shut off, I knew I was experiencing a piece of history.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used this control room when the United States first sent humans to the moon. The room also served as the center for dozens of other space missions.
""This room was used from the Gemini missions all the way through to the space shuttle in the early 1990s,"" said NASA's Gary Kitmacher, my guide.
The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon.
My tour brought back many memories. I remember watching Neil Armstrong take ""one giant leap for mankind"" on my parent's television. In 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon.
A year later, I was glued to the television again. This time, scientists in this very room were trying to figure out how to get the astronauts of Apollo 13 back home when an oxygen tank exploded aboard their craft.
In the same building as the old Mission Control room is the new Mission Control room. Here, scientists keep tabs on the International Space Station (ISS) that orbits above Earth.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of walking on the moon. Walk-ing through Johnson Space Center--some 30 years later--is the next best thing.
The Saturn V rocket used to launch astronauts to the moon is located outside Johnson Space Center in Houston.
In 1965, the Gemini 7 spacecraft makes its historic mission.
Sixteen countries, including the United States, are building the International Space Station.

251,184,"Textbooks in China are getting a makeover. For years, schoolchildren in that Asian country have learned that the Great Wall of China could be seen from space.
Education officials recently ordered school textbook publishers to stop printing the
, or falsehood. In October 2003, Yang Liwei, China's first person in space, reported that he could not see the wall when he orbited Earth.
Liwei's comments contradict the last man on the moon. In 1972, a U.S. astronaut reported that the famous monument was visible from space.
More than 2,000 years old, the Great Wall is the longest structure ever built. Experts estimate that the Great Wall of China is about 4,000 miles long.

252,339,"Some experts question rewarding reading with pizza.
Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting
But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company. ""Schools need to realize that they are undermining their students' well-being,"" says nutrition expert Jane Levine. She explains that the Book It program is a problem not just because it rewards kids with fast food but also because it makes a large company a regular part of the school day.

Thanks to Maathai, many trees have taken root in Africa. Maathai was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize for saving forests and working for women's rights in Africa. She is the first African woman to win the prize. ""It's a really great surprise,"" Maathai said when she heard the good news.
The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the world's most
, or important, awards. Maathai will accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, on December 10. The prize is presented each year on this date in honor of its founder's death.

In 1977, Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement.
Judges award the Nobel Peace Prize to a person or a group working for peace. Nobel Prizes are also given for achievements in science, medicine, and literature. Those prizes are presented on December 10 as well, but in Stockholm, Sweden.
Maathai has dedicated her life to helping the environment. In 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement. This organization has helped plant more than 30 million trees across Africa, which has suffered from the loss of forests.
The judges awarded Maathai the prize for growing more than trees. They said she has planted the seeds of peace by making sure that people have natural resources so they don't fight over them.

255,227,"The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
What are some ways to prevent wildfires?
Few plants or animals live on the icy mountaintops in southern Argentina and Chile. The region is cold, desolate, and snowy.
The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

256,389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

257,368,"""This is George. He lived in Africa. He was a good little monkey and always very curious."" So begins the classic story of the inquisitive monkey Curious George, who leaves his jungle home to go with the man with the yellow hat. The book was first published in 1941 by H. A. and Margret Rey. Now the well-loved monkey stars in the animated movie
which opens in theaters on February 10.
Writer-and-illustrator team H. A. Rey and his wife Margret fled Paris on bicycles during World War II (1939-1945) with a handful of manuscripts. One was a story about a curious chimp. The couple eventually settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wrote seven
tales in all. The books have been translated into 14 languages and describe the crazy adventures of George, whose curiosity often lands him in trouble. The man with the yellow hat helps George out of his various scrapes.
movie stars actor Will Ferrell as the voice of the man with the yellow hat. ""For years, Curious George has amused, entertained, and taught children around the world,"" Ferrell told
""His adventures make us laugh, and we all depend on humor in life.""

258,213,"A spacecraft zooms toward Pluto and beyond to learn more about the solar system.
will capture photos from Pluto. It will also gather information from objects in the Kuiper Belt, the mysterious region on the fringes of our solar system.
Very little is known about Pluto, currently the farthest planet from the sun. The tiny planet is one-sixth the size of Earth. It is more than 3 billion miles away, much too far to be seen in detail with a telescope from Earth. Pluto is the only planet that has not been explored by a spacecraftuntil now.
In late January, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched the
spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The space probe is now speeding toward Pluto. ""The United States of America has just made history by launching the first spacecraft to explore Pluto,"" mission expert Alan Stern said at launch time.
or scientists who study space, hope they will soon have much more information about the planet that lies on the edge of our solar system. New Horizons will fly by Pluto to take photos and study the icy planet. All the information it gathers will be beamed back to Earth.
will reach Pluto in July 2015. The 1,054-pound spacecraft will get as close as 6,200 miles from Plutos surface.
which is about the size of a grand piano, will also use its powerful cameras to capture images of Plutos moon, Charon. The probe will then zoom beyond Pluto and take pictures of the
The Kuiper Belt is a region that orbits the sun in the far reaches of the solar system. It is filled with thousands of rocky, icy objects.
Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper Belt are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago. Researchers hope the images will provide clues to how the solar system was created.
The nine and a half years it will take
to reach Pluto will be a long wait for scientists, but they say it will be worth it. ""This is one of the most important regions of the solar system,"" says mission expert Hal Weaver. ""It hasnt been explored yet, and
is going to be the first mission to go out there and look at it up close and personal.""

259,722,"Educators spread the word about slavery in the North.
Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828.

262,568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.
One scientist said that Hunter's find was very rare. Only about one of every 10,000 snakes has two heads!

266,789,"Richard Rodriguez recently set a new world's record for riding a roller coaster. He rode a coaster for 2,000 bone-rattling hours. That's about 22,655 miles.
To set the record, Rodriguez (front) rode a roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, an amusement park in England, for 22 hours a day for 90 days. After setting the record, Rodriguez said, ""It was a small step for me, but a giant roller coaster ride for mankind.""
Setting records for riding roller coasters isn't new to Rodriguez. He set his first record in 1977, when he rode a coaster for 103 hours and 55 minutes. He has broken that record many times in the last 23 years.

267,387,"recently told you about some problems manatees face. A poll found that most Florida voters want more done to protect manatees. The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat.

268,399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

Later, the U.S. Congress said the holiday should take place on the fourth Thursday in November. This chart shows the number of turkeys raised in the United States from 2001 to 2005.

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

271,409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

272,258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

273,52,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

275,18,"What is one of your worst nightmares about the school day? No recess!
For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.
Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or
, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.
The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.
One fifth grader in Virginia told the
she looks forward to the daily break so she can return fresh to her schoolwork. ""I feel like I'm ready for anything that comes my way,"" she said.

276,219,"Have you ever closed your eyes and tried to walk from one end of a room to the other? It's hard. Now, imagine running a race with your eyes closed. That's similar to what running is like for Maria Runyan.
Runyan, age 31, is legally blind. She is the first legally blind athlete to qualify for a U.S. Olympic team. She is competing in the 1,500-meter running race in Sydney.
Runyan has had Stargardt's disease since she was 9 years old. As a result of that disease, Runyan can't see much of anything in the center of her vision.

277,259,"Aochan, a rat snake, and Gohan, a dwarf hamster, are an unlikely pair of friends. The two share a cage at a zoo in Tokyo, Japan. Zookeepers placed the hamster, whose name is Japanese for ""meal,"" in the snakes cage as a tasty snack. Instead of chowing down on Gohan, the snake befriended the furry rodent. ""Ive never seen anything like it,"" says zookeeper Kazuya Yamamoto. ""Gohan sometimes even climbs onto Aochan to take a nap on his back.""

278,793,"By now, everyone knows that cigarettes are
, which means people can develop a need for them that is very hard to get rid of. However, until recently, no studies had measured how addictive.
Cigarettes contain many chemicals, including a chemical called nicotine, which studies have proved is addictive.
For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks.
The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction.

279,98,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

284,684,"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away.
The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth.
In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame
for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature.
Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined.
More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food.
As the sea ice disappears, the mighty
, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues.
Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened.
Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice.
Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result.
The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken.
Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity.
Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth.
To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now.""
The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the
Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as
What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?

285,349,"Would you spend a month in a small room with 2,700 scorpions? That's what a woman from Malaysia did recently. Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia.
Malena Hassan, age 24, set a record by living with a roomful of scorpions, which are poisonous, for 30 days.
During her monthlong ordeal, Hassan was stung seven times and as a result, suffered from a high fever.
But it was worth it, Hassan said after she set the new record. ""This is my dream come true. I am very happy and proud...to have accomplished this very difficult record"", she said.

286,583,"Germany, Chile, and Liberia elect their first female leaders.
Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.
Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge.
Johnson-Sirleaf vows to unite Liberia and create jobs.
The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce
or joblessness, in her country. ""We want to give people hope of having jobs,"" she says.
As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countrys rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer.""
Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberias first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war.
Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs.
or bring back together, her country. ""I am excited by the potential of what I representthe aspirations and expectations of women in Liberia, African women, and women all over the world,"" she said in her inauguration speech.
Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll.
Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election.

287,375,"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March.
The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause.
Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of
that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do.
Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in
Other humanoid robots created by Japanese companies have been getting plenty of attention even without playing the trumpet.
Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it.
Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune.
In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous.""
Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money.
Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes.
that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives.
Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans.
Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer.
1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name?
2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs.
3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan.
Robots are used for a variety of purposes from helping out in offices to performing surgery.
2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital.
3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people.
How does technology help improve people's lives?

288,31,"visits India and finds hope after tragedy
A year after the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia, rebuilding efforts continue in full force.
Each day, 10-year-old Sarjm walks through the hot sand and past
the rubble where homes used to stand. He can see and even taste the ocean. The ocean used to make him happy. It provided fishermen like his father a way of making a living.
But on December 26, 2004, the ocean turned black and changed his village. It left behind destruction and fear. A memorial outside his school is a constant reminder of the 49 schoolchildren who lost their lives in the tsunami that struck on that date.
Debris of beach resorts washed away in the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami at Khao Lak, Thailand, seen December 30.
The young boy talks about how his older brother and younger sister were both ""taken by the black wave."" Clapping his hands together, he told
Sadly, it is a story shared by thousands of other children. Sarjm lives in Kottapalli, a fishing village located at the southernmost tip of India. India was one of 12 countries devastated by last years tsunamione of the worst natural disasters in history. The series of gigantic waves, which resulted from an undersea earthquake, flattened coastlines and reduced fishing villages to rubble. More than 280,000 people died.
Now, one year later, many people are still homeless. But slowly, smiles are returning, and laughter once again rings through some of the fishing villages. Relief agencies have been working to help rebuild homes, schools, and lives with donations from people around the world.
Some of those donations came from American students who
or came together, to raise money to help people affected by the tsunami. From schools in small towns to those in big cities, students held bake-a-thons, participated in read-a-thons, and even sold their own belongings at garage sales. The pennies, quarters, and dollars are helping rebuild homes and bringing hope to children whose hearts and lives were shattered.
Nine-year-old Selso, who lives in a fishing village near Sarjms village, was one of those children. Before the tsunami destroyed his home, Selso, his sister, and his three brothers had never had a toilet or electricity in their house. Their house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. ""We only lost our home.""
Selsos mother used to worry about scorpions and snakes getting inside, but now all that has changed. Volunteers from Habitat for Humanity worked with Selsos family to construct a new home with electricity and plumbing. Habitat for Humanity volunteers build homes with families who have suffered. The organization plans to build 10,000 homes in the area during the next two years. ""This is the happiest day for my family,"" says Selsos dad, Michel. ""My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework.""
With the help of relief agencies, some schools have also opened. Many are housed in temporary locations under thatched roofs. Classrooms are also beginning to receive textbooks and other much-needed supplies.
""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), after the disaster. The U.S. Agency for International Development is another organization that has helped build playgrounds where children can enjoy new equipment.
As rebuilding efforts continue, many children remain terrified of the ocean. Volunteers have worked with Sarjm and other kids to talk about what happened. ""I was afraid to go back to the ocean,"" Sarjm says, ""but we were taught that the tsunami was very rare and would not happen again. I am not afraid to look at the water anymore.""
Why is it important to feel safe? What makes you feel safe at home? at school?
After the tsunami, countries in southern Asia began to put together a plan for a warning system in the Indian Ocean. Earlier this year, the U.S. government also announced a plan to improve the U.S. warning system by 2007. Under the plan, the number of devices that monitor waves from a tsunami will be increased. The warning system would provide an alert for U.S. coasts ""within minutes, and in some cases, within seconds of a tsunamis formation,"" according to scientist John Marburger.

289,83,"Many people hate bugs. They can't stand to let the creepy crawlers near them. But some people find bugs fascinating and tasty.
Each year, the Great Insect Fair is held in State College, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people attend the fair to look at bugs, touch bugs, and even eat bugs.
Dorothy Blair is a nutrition expert. She says the fair teaches visitors that insects are an important source of food for people in some other countries.
Visitors to the fair can munch on stir-fried mealworms, cooked wax moth larvae, and chocolate-covered crickets, which are called Chocolate Chirpies.
""Last year, we ran out of Chocolate Chirpies. We had to make about 6,000 of them this year,"" Blair said.
Many of the fair's visitors are kids. Emily Paulson, age 7, played with a millipede at the fair. The large bug crawled up her arm. She said, ""It's sort of like a comb crawling up your arm. It was neat!""

Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

291,127,"Trained rats may soon be used to find survivors who are trapped after disasters.
A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters.
Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size.
The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals.
The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back.
Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months.

292,670,"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar systems giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

293,452,"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls!
The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education.
Educators say 10 million additional teachers will be needed to teach those kids.
Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids.
To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools.
This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math.
Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it.
Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees.

294,214,"A ""cat-tastrophe"" recently struck the airport near Providence, Rhode Island. Airport officials were forced to cancel a flight when they found a runaway cat named Muffy sitting in the airplane's wheel well, the place where the landing gear is stored during flight.
The wayward cat had been placed in a cage to be put aboard an airplane. But somehow Muffy escaped and climbed into the wheel well of a nearby plane.
Airport workers spent hours trying to coax the cat down from its hiding place. They even offered Muffy some tasty treats.
Finally, after seven hours, the workers removed panels from the plane's wing and pulled Muffy to safety. Muffy, the runway runaway, was then reunited with her family.

295,593,"Philippines hopes to set tree-planting world record.
Ready, set, plant! Nearly a million tree lovers
planted more than 500,000 trees on 2,137 miles of highway in the Philippines last month. (
means ""at the same time."") Planters were given 30 minutes to place their trees in the ground.
""This morning, we planted trees all over the
the biggest number of trees planted at one time in the history of the world,"" declared Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who took part in the planting. An archipelago is a group of islands.
The ""Green Philippine Highways"" project aims to improve air quality in the Asian nation. The Philippines has the second most polluted air among eight Southeast Asian countries polled, according to a recent study.
are substances discharged into the air from motor vehicles and factories. Emissions account for 70 percent of air pollution in the Philippines. Experts say it takes at least 10 trees to soak up the emissions from a single vehicle.
The current record for most trees planted at a single time is 300,587, set in 2005 by 16,317 people in India. Arroyo, however, is confident her countrys massive planting is in position to break the record. ""We will probably make it to the Guinness [World] Records,"" she says.

296,422,"Toy companies are always looking for the latest toy craze. One toy maker thinks it has a jump on the competition. It has just come out with a high tech pogo stick called the Airgo.
Unlike other pogo sticks, the Airgo doesn't have squeaky springs that help kids jump up and down. Instead, it has an air pump that will give users some extra lift.
According to an official at Razor USA, which makes the toy, the newly designed pogo stick is ""really cool looking"". It has adjustable handlebars and folds down to 22 inches.
Even though the Airgo may be cool looking, safety experts say that users should always wear helmets and knee and elbow pads.

297,303,"This summer, when 'N Sync took the stage at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Morgan Oseiki was there. The 9-year-old told
that the group did more than ""Bring in' Da Noise."" The members of the band talked about the dangers of illegal drugs.
Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs.
Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.
As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Here's what some kids said their anti-drugs are:
Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin.
Rachel Acevedo, age 10, of Altamonte Springs, Florida, said it's swimming.
Dipo Adedeji, age 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's basketball.
Abigail Tang, age 12, of Brooklyn, New York, said it's writing.
Diana Barrientos, age 11, of Alexandria, Virginia, said it's drawing.

298,160,"When you are at school or hanging with friends, do you wonder what your dog is doing in your house? If so, a new robot might be just what you need.
The robot, called Maron-1, is made by a company in Japan. Maron-1 looks like a cartoon copy of R2-D2. It weighs about 11 pounds and stands about 2 feet high. When it goes on sale in Japan next year, the robot will cost about $1,600.
The makers of Maron-1 say their robot is better than the other kinds of robots that you can buy at toy stores. ""Our robot is different from pet robots. It's useful,"" said a representative from the company that makes Maron-1.
Maron-1 can detect whether someone or something is moving in front of it. If it sees"" something moving, it says, ""An intruder found."" It can also call you on a cell phone to tell you about the intruder.
The amazing robot can do many other things as well. It can turn on electronic equipment, such as a TV and a VCR. Maron-1 can move around, but it cannot go up or down stairs.

299,340,"Astronomers have decided that eight is the magic number when it comes to our solar system. The eight planets now include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto belongs in a new class referred to as dwarf planets. The decision was made to create the new category because powerful telescopes have let scientists find more and more Pluto-like objects in space.
Jupiter is the largest planet. It is 88,846 miles wide.
Mercury has the fastest orbit around the sun. It moves almost 30 miles a second.
Venus is the hottest planet. Its average surface temperature is 867 degrees.
the largest asteroid, was discovered in 1801. Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun. Most lie in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
the frozen dwarf, is located 4 billion miles from the sun. Charon, Plutos largest moon, was found in 1978.

300,257,"""A penny for your thoughts"" is something many people say to one another. Soon, however, the old saying may have to be changed to ""a nickel for your thoughts.""
Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.
Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside.
Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down.
The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies.

301,786,"Heather Lindaman from upstate New York won't be playing dodgeball anytime soon. In 2001, Heather, then 7 years old, was playing dodgeball in gym class when she fell, slamming into a hardwood floor and breaking her elbow.
After Heather's injury, her parents brought a case to court against the school. They argued that dodgeball is too dangerous for young kids to play in school. A New York court is currently hearing the case. Based on the court's decision, the school may decide whether the game should be
To play dodgeball, one team's members must hit opposing players with a large rubber ball to eliminate them from the game. The team with players left in the game wins.
Some schools in Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, Virginia, Texas, and Utah have already banned dodgeball or versions of the game. Some of those versions include war ball, monster ball, and kill game.
The National Association for Sport and Physical Education agrees that dodgeball does not belong in schools. That organization is made up of 20,000 gym teachers, coaches, and trainers. ""Dodgeball is not an appropriate activity for K-12 school physical education programs,"" the group told reporters.
Members of the association argue that dodgeball promotes violence and is unfair. They say that the game encourages bullying because stronger kids target weaker ones.
Don't toss dodgeball to the sidelines, say others. Nick Troy is a director with the National Amateur Dodgeball Association. Although his group is not connected with schools, he points out that the game has benefits.
""Dodgeball develops hand-eye coordination, strengthens muscles, and builds concentration skills,"" Troy told
. ""It is also a good form of exercise.""
Should dodgeball be thrown out of school?
Troy and others argue that dodgeball is no more dangerous than other school sports that kids play. Troy also disagrees that smaller kids are at a disadvantage. ""The goal isn't necessarily to get the weakest player out,"" he said. ""It's to get the best player out.""

302,681,"Iraq's new government prepares for the future.
Women line up to vote in the southern Iraqi city of Basra January 30, in the country's first freely contested elections since 1954.
The government in Iraq has started the process of choosing leaders and drafting a constitution, now that the election is over. On January 30, millions of Iraqis voted, braving violence and threats of attack in the country's first national election in 50 years.
On that historic day, voters elected 275 leaders to the National Assembly, Iraq's lawmaking body. The assembly recently chose a president and two vice presidents. At press time, those leaders were selecting a prime minister, the most powerful position in Iraq.
Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to
Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents.
Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected.

304,9,"For years, scientists have known about a group of icy objects, called
, in our solar system. They circle the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Scientists thought centaurs were made of ice and were almost completely smooth. But recent photos of one of those objects, named Asbolus 8405, are proving scientists wrong.
Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.
Asbolus 8405 formed when the solar system first formed, scientists say. They hope that the object will help them learn more about what the solar system was like when it first formed.

306,253,"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.
Earth's moon has a rocky surface dotted with craters
Mimas looks like the Death Star from the movie Star Wars
Dione's surface is completely covered with ice and craters
Titan is Saturn's largest moon. A thick, murky atmosphere surrounds it.

307,175,"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.

310,11,"As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are getting bounced around. A new study, published in the medical journal
shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

311,634,"Ann Thompson is one of the best athletes in the world. She is the captain of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team. She has already won five medals in earlier Paralympic games, and she is determined to win another in Sydney, Australia. Recently,
The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

312,371,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.
Dobbin House was used as a ""station"" for hiding runaway slaves on their dangerous journey to freedom along the Underground Railroad.

313,467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.
""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday. Its a number that gives us an opportunity to see where weve been and think about where we want to go,"" scientist Howard Hogan of the U.S. Census Bureau told
Its been almost 40 years since the U.S. population hit the 200 million mark. The country has added about 2.8 million people each year. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States.

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15 to October 15.
Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. Nearly 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the country, reports the U.S. Census Bureau. They are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries.
To honor Hispanic traditions and history, Americans celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It began on September 15. That date marks the anniversary of independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

314,415,"Thunder provides a wake-up call to head indoors.
""When thunder roars, go indoors,"" says meteroologist Ron Holle.
Scientists say lightning strikes the surface of Earth about 100 times each second. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring and summer. During those seasons, experts warn people to be especially aware of the dangers of lightning.
is the flash of light that occurs when electricity moves between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The huge spark of electricity is like the tiny kind you get when you run a comb through your hair or scuff your feet on a carpetonly much stronger.
A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the
or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest.
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck.
The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed.

317,300,"If two heads are better than one, a newly discovered turtle is head and shoulders above other turtles. May Toro found a two-headed turtle in Florida. ""I was shocked. I couldn't believe it,"" Toro said after she picked up the turtle.
Toro works for Mary Kraus, who studies turtles. Kraus says she has seen the eggs of two headed turtles before. However, she has never seen a living two-headed turtle. ""This is the first time I've ever seen one alive, fully developed, and hatched,"" Kraus said.
The two-headed turtle is a loggerhead turtle. The U.S. government says the loggerhead turtle is an endangered species. Loggerhead turtles can grow to be 3 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds!
After studying the turtle for a couple of days, Toto and Kraus let the turtle go. ""We didn't want it to become a freak in a freak show"", Kraus said.

318,566,"This map might not lead to a pot of gold, but officials at the Library of Congress consider it very valuable. The Library of Congress recently paid $10 million for the first map to name America. Printed in 1507, the map is the only copy of its kind left in the world.
Officials said the map is the most expensive item that the library has ever purchased. The library raised most of the money from Congress and other groups.
America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer. The map showing America was kept in a castle in Germany for 350 years and was rediscovered in 1901.

320,2,"School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Fourth grader Christina Moore from Belmont, Massachusetts, has a busy schedule. Along with doing her homework, she plays ice hockey and takes flute lessons. Once bedtime rolls around, she is usually exhausted. Like most kids her age, Christina has some strangeand sillydreams.
characters ate leftover casserole in my kitchen and wouldn't give any to me,"" Christina told
. ""In another dream, a group of parents were so unhappy with their kids' grades that they pushed them off a building into a salad filled with French dressing!"" Whenever she gets sick, Christina has the same dreamsomeone is chasing her through a forest.
What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works.
Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school.
So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help
""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told
. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports.""
While you're snoozing, your brain doesn't shut down. Your brain stays busy and goes through five stages of sleep each night.
, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes.
Everybody dreamsalthough scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different
, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information.
The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep.
Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as wellor at all.
Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges.
Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures.
like their sleep. They live in eucalyptus trees in Australia. Koalas dine on a steady diet of eucalyptus leaves, which are not very nutritious. To store up their energy, koalas snooze up to 18 hours a day.
don't need pillows because they sleep only 2 hours a daymostly standing up. They only lie down to dream. A giraffe doesn't lie down that much because it would take too long to get up if a predator were to approach.
sleep and swim at the same time! They need to keep breathing while they rest, so they let one-half of their brain sleep and keep one eye open. Dolphins rest for 7 hours a day on and off, switching sides of the brain they shut down.
What are other ways kids can get into a healthful sleep routine?

321,122,"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw.
""We've gotten several reports of [a] brilliant white light the size of a basketball with blue flames turning to orange,"" said one police official.
The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, a
is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained.
Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery.
For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret.
Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI).
""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member.
The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965.
On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills.
The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again.
The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member.
For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth.

322,120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

323,540,"Hawaii has reason to celebrate! The state welcomed its baseball champs home after they won the Little League World Series in late August.
That victory marked the first time a team from Hawaii has won a Little League world championship. Hawaii's West Oahu of Ewa Beach team defeated a team from Curaao, a country in the Caribbean, 76.
It was not an easy win. Curaao was the defending champ. The game went into extra innings. Hawaii came back from three runs down to tie the game. It was the first time a championship had gone into extra innings since 1971.
The championship game was played in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, before more than 25,000 fans. (Little League Baseball began in Pennsylvania in 1939.)
Michael Memea, 12, of Hawaii cracked the game-winning home run. ""I knew it was gone,"" he later said proudly.
After his home run, Memea rounded the bases and high-fived his teammates, who were waiting for him at home plate. Then the team took a victory jog around the stadium while fans cheered wildly. After the win, Hawaii's team manager Layton Aliviado said, ""Our dream came true!""

324,659,"History in the Making: Mercury 3 Rescue Mission
The Mercury missions were the first attempts by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to send a human into space. The rocket missions took place from 1961 to 1963. During the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union competed to build the best space program. That period was called the space race. Tia interviewed her grandfather, Clark Presler, about his role in the 1961 Mercury 3 mission, during which astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. became the first American in space.
What do you remember from your experiences in the Navy?
I remember being part of the pickup crew [aboard the U.S.S.
] when the first manned space capsule returned to Earth. It was May 5, 1961. The name of the [rocket] was the Mercury-Redstone 3.
What was the purpose of this mission?
NASA wanted to send a man into orbit and back safely. His name was Alan B. Shepard Jr.
The capsule reached [an altitude of] about 187.45 kilometers, which is 114.61 miles.
The orbit flight lasted only 15 minutes.
In the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida.
How did you pick up Mr. Shepard?
Well, we lifted the capsule up on the chain. Alan was standing up on it, hanging on to the chain. He came out without a single scratch on his body.
At first, I thought this project would be easy, but after the interview I knew I had to learn what this was all about. So later that day I asked Grandpa to explain this to me. After that, it sounded a lot clearer, and it's fun having a member of your family actually do something, well, famous.

325,217,"An Iowa class heads into high-tech tests.
Every student in class has a remote control, and the kids are clicking away at the screen. But they aren't changing channels. They're taking a test! Terry Rex's fourth graders at Wings Park Elementary School in Oelwein, Iowa, are using a new kind of classroom technology. Instead of writing with pencils on exam papers, the students use remote controls to take tests.
""It's more fun,"" Courtney Ricchio, 9, told
""I don't have to write, and my hand doesn't get tired."" The remote controls are part of the Classroom Performance System (CPS). When students use CPS to take a test, the questions appear on an electronic screen. Students key in their answers on the remote-control response pad.
Rex is one of the first teachers in Iowa to use CPS. His students use the technology for more than taking tests. They also play learning games with the system. Sam Myott, 9, says his favorite CPS activity is a football game. ""It's a math game with multiplication and subtraction,"" he told
""Since it's on the computer, it's more fun than a worksheet on your desk.""
Some teachers think using CPS to grade a test is more
or a better use of time, than grading a written test. The computer keeps track of the students' answers and prints out their grades at the end of the day. The computer also reports which questions the class found most difficult to answer, so Rex can review them with the group.
Classrooms across the country are trying out new teaching gadgets.
Sixth graders Marina Gagliano and Kerry O'Conner of Wellwood Middle School in Fayetteville, New York, label parts of a microscope on an interactive whiteboard. The whiteboard allows students to use their fingers to click and tap answers on the projected image.
Fourth and fifth graders at Elton Hills Elementary School in Rochester, Minnesota, are on the move. Their classrooms have no chairs! Tiny desks hold high-tech gadgets, such as laptops and iPods, with different lessons. Researchers say this setup may be healthier for students than sitting at desks all day.

326,267,"During National SAFE KIDS Week, doctors plan to give kids tips about how to prevent accidents.
Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

327,385,"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million
. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

328,216,"Central Florida cleans up after the first tornadoes of 2007.
The windy season in Florida began in a big way. Residents of four counties are recovering after a series of destructive
ripped through central Florida, killing 20 people, damaging hundreds of homes, and cutting off power to more than 20,000 people. A tornado is a powerful, rotating tube of air that runs from the ground to a thundercloud. The recent tornado was so strong that it lifted a moving tractor-trailer off the ground and dropped it onto another truck. Fortunately, neither driver was seriously hurt. The drivers did, however, find out how powerful a tornado can be!
Tunnel of Fury: How A Tornado Forms
The strongest tornadoes develop from powerful, large-scale thunderstorms called
. The Florida tornadoes were created by supercell storms.
 Supercells are created when fronts of warm, moist air collide with cold, dry air.
 The opposing warm and cold gusts of air create a rotating column of rising wind called a
 When the funnelshaped cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
During the recent Florida tornadoes, winds reached speeds of more than 150 miles per hour. The storms were rated EF-3 on the
Scientists use the scale to measure the size and strength of tornadoes. The scale ranges from EF-0, the weakest, and EF-5, the strongest (with winds of more than 200 miles per hour).
Average number of tornadoes reported each year in the United States:
Length of damage trail a tornado can leave: up to
Tornado time span: up to one hour, but most tornadoes last less than

329,734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

Cassini is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings.
Scientists have uncovered some of Saturn's secrets. Researchers recently learned that the planet's famous rings have changed during the past 25 years. The information has been collected from tools aboard the
, or circling, the ringed planet last year.
is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings. Its ring bands are named with the letters
. The rings, however, are not in alphabetical order. They were assigned a letter in the order in which they were discovered.
One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.
The image of Enceladus was taken by the
spacecraft. Enceladus is one of Saturn's 47 known moons. The red areas appear to be craters and ridges on the icy moon's surface.
Other images revealed water vapor escaping from cracks on the moon. Water vapor indicates that Saturn has an
, a layer of air that surrounds a planet.
Tiny Enceladus now joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as places in the solar system that may have liquid water beneath their surfaces. Water is necessary for life to exist.

The athletes who compete in the newly admitted Olympic sports are very excited about going to Sydney. ""It is an awesome feeling, and I don't even know how to explain it."" said Barbara Kunkel. Kunkel is a member of the U.S. tae kwon do team.
A sport must meet certain rules to become a part of the Olympic Games. Leaders of a sport must apply to be a part of the Olympics seven years before the sport can be included in any Olympic Games.
In addition, a men's sport must be ""widely practiced in at least 75 countries,"" and a women's sport must be practiced ""in at least 40 countries and on three continents.""
The United States is sending more than 200 athletes to the Games in Sydney. Those athletes are competing against athletes from more than 190 nations.
Other Summer Olympic events include track and field, swimming, baseball, and sailing.
The last Summer Olympics took place in the United States in 1996. The 1996 Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia, and the United States won 101 medals, the most won in the 1996 Games. This year, U.S. athletes, including Barbara Kunkel, are trying for a Olympic repeat.

333,408,"Live from New York ... except this time, it wasn't! Pop singer Ashlee Simpson, the younger sister of singer Jessica Simpson, was caught
Lip-synching is mouthing the words or singing along to a recording. Some performers sing along to a prerecorded track to make their voice sound stronger.
A computer glitch was to blame for Simpson's mix-up on
. Simpson, 20, was caught lip-synching when the words to the wrong song began playing.
Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse.
""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do.""
An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts.
Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility.
Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance.
""[Lip-synching is ridiculous] and not entertaining in the least,"" a person commented online to NBC, the company that airs

334,481,"Archaeologists in northwestern England are thrilled about a rare find. The scientists recently unearthed a burial site of six Viking men and women. They discovered swords, spears, jewelry, and other artifacts.
This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.
, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England.
The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

What is the most famous address in the country? 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue! That is where the White House is located in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States.
The president of the United States lives and works in the White House. President George W. Bush hopes that it remains his home for the next four years.

337,287,"Erin Beth Turner of West Hartford, Connecticut, was among the millions of kids who bought
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
this summer. After buying her copy, the 10-year-old told
, ""I'll read it until I go to bed, and finish it in a few days.""
The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter.""
The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told
that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary.""
Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision.
recently talked to people in Zeeland about Harry.
Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga.
Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids
question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures.""
Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing.""
When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun.""

338,557,"From our planet, you can see Earth's single moon in the evening sky. Imagine living on a planet that has 17 moons! That's the number of moons that orbit Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Scientists spotted a 17th moon orbiting Jupiter while they were looking for comets.
Scientists say the newly discovered moon is 3 miles wide. It is the smallest of Jupiter's known moons. Scientists used to think that Leda, a moon discovered in 1974, was Jupiter's smallest moon. Leda is between 5 and 10 miles wide.
Scientists have not officially named the newly discovered moon yet. For now they are calling it S/1999 J1.

339,284,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

, joins Bugs and Daffy on a wild adventure in the upcoming movie
The film hits theaters nationwide on November 14.
caught up with Fraser to ask him about starring in a movie with the famous cartoon characters:
What made you decide to take this role?
To star alongside such greats as Bugs Bunny and the whole cast of toons was an easy decision. But don't tell Daffy. It will go to his head!
: Did you watch Looney Toons on television when you were growing up?
Every Saturday morning! I used to get sent to the principal's office for doing my impression of the Tasmanian Devil in class. Now the director let me do Taz in the movie. Aaaah, revenge is sweet!
: What was the best part of acting in this movie?
Having to imagine that you're in a cartoon world is no easy task. I loved the challenge of believing I was alongside the characters each day.

341,421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

342,360,"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous.
According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss.
Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said.
Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems.
Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems.
For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions.
Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead.
Listen Up! This diagram shows the parts of your ear. Loud noises can damage the cochlea and cause hearing loss.

With this tragedy, Americans have been reminded of the risks and the glory of space travel. The nation came together with an outpouring of sympathy for the loss of
crew. Flags were flown at half-staff. People in Texas and Florida created memorials.
Despite the shuttle's loss, President Bush has said the United States will persist in its exploration of space. ""Our journey into space will go on,"" said Bush.

344,759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""

345,209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

347,208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

Getting approval for the museum was no easy task.In fact, politicians and leaders worked for almost 100 years to get the bill signed. ""This has been a long, hard effort, but we're here today,"" one government official told

350,587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

352,288,"Would you know what to do if a fire started in your home? Every year, more than 400,000 fires begin in U.S. homes. You can prepare for an emergency by making and practicing a home fire escape plan!
all rooms, doors, windows, and smoke alarms.
at least two ways out of each room. That way you will know how to escape no matter where you are, and no matter where the fire is.
a meeting place outside, away from your home, where all members of your household can gather after they have left the building.
any fire escapes or fire stairs in your building if you live in an apartment or high rise. (Talk to your building manager or local fire department about what you should do if a fire starts in your building.)
the location of a neighbor's house, public phone, or call box to alert the fire department. (Or, assign a family member to bring a portable phone when exiting your home.)
""Develop a home fire escape plan with your family. Practice your home escape plan at least twice a year. Pretend that some escape routes are blocked by smoke and fire so that you can practice using different exits. Close all doors behind you as you exit to keep smoke from spreading through your home. Most of all, when your smoke alarm sounds, don't delay! Use your plan to get out safely.""

Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning.""
Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground.
In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night.
Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time.
Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep.

356,541,"Steve Cantees is a high school principal. He always worries about his students' grades and behavior. This year, he is also concerned about their school clothes.
His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees.
Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans.
For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds.
Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.
Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist.""
Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

357,531,"For most kids, the average school daysix and a half hoursis long enough. But in some states, officials want more time on students' side. Kids need more time to learn, they say.
More class time can improve test scores, according to a recent report by the research group Education Sector. As a result, schools are experimenting with tacking on an hour or more to the school day.
Elementary and middle school students at Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have gone to an eight-hour school day. Fletcher-Maynard Academy is just one of 10 schools in Massachusetts trying out the new schedule. Lawmakers in Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C., are also debating extended school hours.
People in favor of longer school days say kids need to learn more to stay competitive in today's world. The additional hours enable teachers to spend more time on each subject. Fletcher-Maynard principal Robin Harris likes having the extra hours. ""Teachers can be a little more creative,"" she told
Students aren't just spending the extra time with their heads in a book, though. Harris explains that her students get longer recesses and more snack time. Parent Dawn Oliver says her 11-year-old daughter, Brittany, is an advice columnist for a magazine at her school in Fall River, Massachusetts. ""The kids get so involved in these things because it's not all book work,"" says Oliver.
Critics argue that extended school days could be too long for today's busy kids. And extra school time might prevent students from exploring other interests. Some students have complained about having to stay later. They are concerned that they wouldn't be able to concentrate during the last classes of the day.
Other people point out that longer school days
with, or get in the way of, after-school sports and clubs. ""The day is long enough already,"" student Cameron Villers from Ansonia, Connecticut, told
""After-school activities would be affected. Nobody wants to be at school from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m."" If schools have different schedules, planning athletic games could prove difficult.

358,558,"President George W. Bush and Laura Bush have settled into the White House. Even though their daughters, Barbara and Jenna, are at college, the President and First Lady are not alone. They have three pets with them.
Spot Fetcher Bush, one of the dogs, should feel right at home in the White House. She was born there in 1989. Spot's mother was Millie. Millie belonged to Bush's parents, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara.
The Bushes' other dog, Barney, also has political connections. Christine Todd Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, gave Barney to the Bush family.
India, a cat, is the only White House pet that does not have political connections. It is nicknamed ""Willie.""

359,101,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is the
Bush wants to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.
Kerry wants to do more to keep our waterways free from pollution.
Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws.
Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply.

361,104,"What is wrong with the following statement?
The probability of obtaining a 6 when I throw a die is
- so if I throw the die 6 times I should get exactly 1  6.
In theory this statement is true, but in practise it might not be the case. Try throwing a die 6 times - you won't always get one 6.
Kate and Josh each throw a die 30 times.
a) How many times would you expect Kate to obtain a 6?
b) How many times would you expect Josh to obtain a 6?
c) How many times would you expect Kate or Josh to obtain a 6?
a) In theory, Kate should obtain a 6 on
of her throws. Therefore, in theory she should throw a 6 on
b) Josh should also throw to obtain a 6 on
c) In total, Kate and Josh have thrown the die 60 times. You would expect them to obtain a 6 on 10 of those throws. However, it is very unlikely that Kate and Josh obtained exactly the same results, or that either of them threw a 6 on 5 occasions.
As you can see, if an experiment is repeated, the results are not necessarily the same each time.
However, it is more likely that their combined results were closer to the expected outcome (10  6s) than their individual results.
In other words, if you do a large number of trials you will get a more accurate result.

The Tempest second key extract - Language
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, patterns of language that appear in both, or how language changes from the first to the second extract.
Love is strongly linked to magic. Miranda thinks that Ferdinand is a ""spirit"". He thinks that she is a ""goddess"". It is strongly suggested that their love at first sight is simply an illusion.
Miranda and Ferdinand's speeches are very honest and loving. Ferdinand is ""humble"", whilst Miranda talks of her ""modesty"".
When Prospero describes love he uses terms linked to control, e.g ""They are both in either's powers""; his daughter will ""control"" Ferdinand.
Prospero recognises that Miranda and Ferdinand's love is real and beyond their control. He compares it to a disease. He says his daughter is ""infected"".
There are lots of references to freedom and slavery. Prospero promises to free Ariel; he threatens to ""manacle"" Ferdinand. Ferdinand doesn't mind being a slave as long as he has Miranda to love.
Ferdinand uses a metaphor linked to slavery to describe his past crushes. He admits that he only suffers the indignity of being Prospero's slave for Miranda's sake.
The exchanges between characters are short to speed up the action.
The speeches between Miranda and Ferdinand are much longer. The content is moving and romantic.

The weathering of rocks by chemicals is called chemical weathering. Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic because
from the air dissolves in it. Minerals in rocks may react with the rainwater, causing the rock to be weathered.
Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example,
are made of a mineral called calcium carbonate. When acidic rainwater falls on limestone or chalk, a chemical reaction happens. New soluble substances are formed in the reaction. These are washed away and the rock is weathered.
Chemical weathering can hollow out caves form and make cliffs fall away.
are hard rocks that are weathered only slowly. Still some of their minerals do react with the acids in rainwater to form new, weaker substances that crumble and fall away.
When fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned,
escape into the air. These dissolve in the water in the clouds and make the rainwater more acidic than normal. When this happens, we call the rain '
Acid rain makes chemical weathering happen more quickly. Buildings and statues made from rock are damaged as a result. This is worse when the rock is limestone rather than granite. Acid rain also kills trees and fish.

The Tempest second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!

Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!

Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum.
Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point.
He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm.
""Let's go downstairs. I don't like the smoke."" Again he felt her hand guide him, and he ducked his head and began to walk along the aisle. ""Yeah"".
""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too.
Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen.
What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it?
Ray's thoughts and actions as he gets on the bus
how the writer uses language to create the atmosphere.
In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor.
As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along.
The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader.

Collecting and recording data - Tally & frequency charts
system to record your results is faster than writing out words or figures all the time.
If you record your findings in a tally chart, the data is already collected into groups, and you will not need to group it later on.
To investigate the most popular colour of car passing your house, it is easier to draw tally marks in one of five columns than to write red, blue, silver, silver, red, other, black etc.
If you use a tally chart, you could note down the colour of the cars as they pass, and find the total frequencies at the end of the one-hour period.
Look at the tally chart below. It shows how many CDs students in the maths class own. Fill in the frequency values in the right hand column.

Remember that an element is one type of atom, like carbon, gold or chlorine. We will look at three ways that atoms can exist.
The atoms of some elements do not join up with other atoms. They stay as
The element helium is like this. Helium is an unreactive gas. Helium atoms do not join up with each other or any other element.
element join together we get a molecule of that element.
Oxygen is like this. Two oxygen atoms join together to make an oxyen molecule. Most of the oxygen in the air is in this form. Hydrogen and chlorine also have molecules with two atoms.
Some elements have molecules with more than two atoms. Sulfur atoms can make molecules of eight atoms joined together.
A compound is made when atoms of
This means that compounds will always exist as molecules, not separate atoms. The diagrams show some molecules of common compounds.

. Think of a playground see-saw. The pivot is the thing in the middle of it. When no-one is on the see-saw it is level, but it tips up if someone gets onto one end. Turning forces around a pivot are called
It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite.
, we need to know two things:
the distance from the pivot that the force is applied.
This is the equation for working out a moment:
Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment:
Notice that the unit of moment is
(newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter.
Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced.
A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end.
If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot.
Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.

When you divide 10 by 2, you are working out how many 2's there are in 10.
10  2 = 5, so there are five 2's in 10.
In a similar way, when dividing 2 by
, you are working out how many
Do you see a pattern? Let's write out those calculations a different way.

Statements, which tell us things. We tend to see these in school text books, in newspapers, or in an encyclopedia. For instance:
This Revision Bite is all about sentences.
Questions, which ask us things or make us think about things. For instance:
When did the First World War end?
Orders, which are also called commands. These tell us what to do, so we find these in instructions, recipes and signs. For instance:
Next, take a small pinch of salt and mix it all together.
Exclamations, which are shouted out. You'd hear these at a football match, in arguments, or if you told a joke. For instance:
You don't have to know the names but you do need to know how and when to use them.

Variation and classification - Continuous & discontinuous
Some of the features of the different organisms in a species show continuous variation, and some features show discontinuous variation.
Human height is an example of continuous variation. Height ranges from that of the shortest person in the world to that of the tallest person. Any height is possible between these values. So it is continuous variation.
For any species a characteristic that changes gradually over a range of values shows continuous variation. Examples of such characteristics are:
If you record the heights of a group of people and draw a graph of your results, it usually looks something like this:
The more people you measure, and the smaller the categories you use, the closer the results will be to the curved line. This shape of graph is typical of a feature with continuous variation. Weight and foot length would give graphs similar in shape to this.
Human blood group is an example of discontinuous variation. There are only 4 types of blood group. There are no other possibilities and there are no values in between. So this is discontinuous variation.
A characteristic of any species with only a limited number of possible values shows discontinuous variation. Here are some examples:

Here is a letter to a newspaper explaining why teenagers should be allowed to vote in the election. The ideas are good, but the writing is too informal. Rewrite the letter using formal language. Rollover the highlighted areas for tips.
'Dear Sir', is a more formal way to begin a letter.
This word needs to be deleted. It's far too chatty and informal.
, I think that teenagers have just as much right to vote in an election as someone who's
This should be written out in full: 'who is'.
This is a clich and sounds quite disrespectful. It would be better to just say elderly. The exclamation mark should be changed to a full stop too.
They live in the country too, you know!
'You know' is too chatty. Delete it and the exclamation mark that follows.
'In addition' would be a more formal way to begin this sentence.
This should be wirtten out in full: 'they are'
This should be written out in full: 'they are'
This should be written out in full: 'what is'
going to happen to the country they live in when they're grown-up. But
Avoid starting sentences with 'but' in formal writing. You could use 'on the other hand' to link the sentence to the previous idea.
some people think that teenagers are away with the fairies
This is a clich. 'Irresponsible' sounds more formal.
when it comes to important things like voting. But
Rather than 'but' you could use 'though' at the end of the sentence instead.
not all of us are. And anyway you know some grown ups are like that too
This sentence doesn't sound like a sensible argument. It starts with 'And' whilst 'anyway' and 'you know' are unnecessary. 'Like that' has no power and is unclear. 'Immature' might be a better word to use instead.
'In conclusion' is a more formal way to sum up an argument.
I think teenagers should be given a chance.
Far too informal. 'Yours sincerely' or 'yours faithfully' is the usual way to end a formal letter

Teenagers have just as much right to vote in the election as adults. As citizens of this country, many of us care deeply about what happens to it. Some people think teenagers are too irresponsible to make the important decisions involved in voting but many of us are far more mature than most adults. In conclusion, we should be given a chance to prove ourselves as the mature and responsible young people we are.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as
. Think of what happens when you rub your hands together quickly. The friction warms them up.
as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

385,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

386,164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

387,396,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view.
Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief.
Contain a mixture of fact and opinion.
Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language.
Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader.
Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate 20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"".
Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre':
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'.
How does Charlotte Bront try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph?
She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"".
She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him.
She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault.

> Astronomy and space science - Introduction
The solar system contains planets, their satellites, asteroids and comets. The planets orbit the Sun and take different amounts of time to do this.
We have night and day on Earth because the Earth spins on its axis. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the seasons to change as we orbit the Sun in one Earth year.

Life processes - The respiratory system and ventilation
The human respiratory system contains the organs that allow us to get the oxygen we need and to remove the waste carbon dioxide we don't need. It contains these parts:

It was a dramatic contrast to my first encounter with them on a Tenerife rooftop in 1994. That image of two
lions pacing back and forth in their

Try to use quotations to support your ideas.
Very stressed and unhappy. 'Pacing back and forth' and barely surviving.
Relaxed and peaceful. Lying in the shade and roaring to mark their territory.
In a 'tiny cage' with no water, a rubbish bin and 'narrow sleeping shelves'.
In an 'ancient African valley', their natural habitat.
Stressed and horrible. The lions are cruelly treated and are 'thin' and 'grubby'.

395,456,"Test your listening skills with this quiz. Note down your answer to the questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of listener you are.
1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you:
a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.
c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas.
2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you:
a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.
You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often.
You probably are a good listener...but nobody knows it. Try to be brave and ask people questions during discussions. At least it will take the focus away from you, if that's what you want.

397,80,"> Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

398,244,"If you are asked to summarise a text, you will need to identify what the text is about and write this in as few words as possible.
Summing up a piece of text in a few words can actually be quite difficult, but it is a useful skill.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

400,141,"> Measures - Speed, distance and time
Speed is worked out by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken:
If you travel at 70 km in 2 hours. What is your average speed?
Speed = 70  2 = 35 km/h
The distance in km and the time in h, so the units for speed are km/h.
If you know the speed, you can work out the time or the distance by re-arranging the equation.
hours at an average speed of 4 miles/h. How far will you have walked?
Distance = 4  1.5 = 6 miles

402,356,"Imagine that you are buying a t-shirt for 9.99, a pair of socks for 1.49 and a belt for 8.99 The cashier charges you 23.47. You feel that this is too much - but how do you know?
One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - 9.99 is approximately 10, 1.49 is approximately 1.50 and 8.99 is approximately 9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head.
10 + 1.50 + 9 = 20.50
This is almost 3 less than the cashier asked for, so obviously you have been over-charged.
By rounding the actual values to more manageable numbers, you can estimate the answers to many problems:
3 + 3 + 1 = 7
Round up, round up and try this activity!
Make sure your maths skills add up.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Appealing to the senses
One way of being creative is appealing to the senses.
Let's go back to our description of a coastline. Imagine you want to write about a cliff, concentrating on the sense of sound, sight, touch, taste and smell.
- the waves crashed on the rocks beneath and I heard the gulls screaming above me.
- the heavy, grey rocks looked as if they were about to slide into the leaden sea.
-the wind lifted my hair and I felt sudden gusts sting my face.
- the spray from the waves hit my face and I could taste the salty water on my lips.
- the damp, warm scent of the seaweed rose gently.
Now, see if you can use the same list of senses to describe another sea scene. This time, describe a sunny beach. You don't have to tell a story, just make your description come alive and imagine that you really are there. Once you've written it, compare your ideas to ours on the next page...
Can you match Viral Vinnie's appetite for English, Maths and Science?

Character - Using quotations and useful phrases
When quoting from a text, remember to:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...
when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent).
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Remember that certain words and phrases are helpful when you're explaining an idea in some detail, especially if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following list shows some of those phrases.
Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:

Changes in the environment - Climate change
Some heat energy from the Earths surface escapes into space. If too much heat energy escaped, the planet would be very cold. However some gases in the atmosphere can trap escaping heat energy, causing some of it to pass back to the surface.
, and they keep our planet warm, which is a good thing.
such as oil, coal and natural gas. The energy released is used to power cars and other machines, to generate electricity, and to keep buildings warm. The burning fuel releases waste gases, including carbon dioxide. As the human population increases, more fuel is used, and more carbon dioxide is released.
The extra carbon dioxide increases the greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped by the atmosphere, causing the planet to become warmer than it would be naturally. The increase in global temperature this causes is called
The amount of carbon dioxide in the air has increased a lot in recent years
The average temperature of the planet has increased in recent years
Global warming is beginning to cause big changes in the environment. These include:
ice melting faster than it can be replaced in the Arctic and Antarctic
the oceans warming up  their water is expanding and causing sea levels to rise
changes in where different species of plants and animals can live

Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

Number patterns - Number patterns in diagrams
A number pattern in a diagram often requires counting shapes to find the rule. Again, look at how the pattern grows from one term to the next.
Pattern 1 has 0 orange tiles and 3 blue tiles, so 3 tiles altogether
Pattern 2 has 1 orange tiles and 5 blue tiles, so 6 tiles altogether
Pattern 3 has 2 orange tiles and 7 blue tiles, so 9 tiles altogether
Q1. Based on the number patterns above, draw pattern 4.
Q2. Look again at the number patterns above. Write the rule and the fourth terms for:
Pattern 4 has 3 orange tiles and 9 blue tiles, so 12 tiles altogether
a) The rule for the number pattern of orange tiles is 'add 1' and the 4th term is 3.
b) The rule for the number pattern of blue tiles is 'add 2' and the 4th term is 9.
c) The rule for the number pattern of all tiles is 'add 3' and the 4th term is 12.
Follow the rules and try this activity!

409,624," r  r. Only the 'r' is squared.
Find the area of the following (use
a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14  6  6 = 113.04cm
b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14  5  5 = 78.5cm
A dartboard has a radius of 20cm. The bullseye in the centre of the board has a radius of 1cm.
By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use
The area of the materials required is 10990mm
Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14  20  20 = 1256cm
The area of the small circle is 3.14  1  1 = 3.14cm
Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm
When calculating the area of a circle, remember to use the radius, not the diameter.

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

To work out pressure, we need to know two things:
the area over which the force or weight works.
This is the equation for working out pressure:
A force of 20 N acted over an area of 2 m
(two square metres). What is the pressure?
Notice that the unit of pressure here is N/m
(newtons per square metre). Sometimes you will see another unit being used. This is called the
, so in the example above the pressure is 10 Pa.
Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

412,11,"> The Tempest Summary - The banquet
Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears Ferdinand and Miranda say they love each other. He finally approves of their love.
On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.
A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage.
Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate.
Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano in a smelly pool
Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs.
Prospero is pleased with Ariel, and promises he'll soon be free.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy transfer diagrams
Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of
. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below.
We can show the transfers like this:
the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the
energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms.
But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by
. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this:
Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

417,346,"Are you a chatterbox or a master speaker? Note down your answer to these questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of speaker you are.
1. Your group is giving a presentation on a character in the book you've been reading as a class. Do you:
a) Make it up as you go along, forget what you've already said and start to laugh.
b) Spend all your time making a massive poster of the character.
c) Plan what you're going to say, and speak loudly and clearly, even though you feel nervous.
2. Your teacher asks you to read aloud in class. Do you:
a) Read the extract really quickly to get it done as soon as possible.
b) Read the extract and look up at the end when you've finished.
c) Read the extract in a slow and clear manner using emotion and pauses where appropriate.
3. You've written a really good speech and the time has come for you to present it to the class. Do you:
a) Wonder, at the last minute, if you look a bit of a geek, and read out the speech as if it was your granny's shopping list.
b) Hide in the toilet and hope that you'll get good marks for writing the speech even if you don't present it.
c) Try to act out the speech as if it were a piece of drama. You feel a bit nervous, but you want people to know how passionate you are about the subject.
4. During informal class discussions, you usually:
a) Talk as much as possible. Sometimes, even when other people are talking.
b) Keep quiet and let others do the talking.
c) Think about what you want to say before you speak, having listened to other people's ideas.
5. In a class debate, you are put on the team that opposes the motion, 'Meat is Murder', but you are a vegetarian! Do you:
a) Read out the speech that your team has helped you prepare, but lose interest for the rest of the debate.
b) Refuse to take part and say nothing.
c) Use your knowledge as a vegetarian to guess what the proposing team's points might be, so that you can help your team to knock those arguments down and win the debate.
You probably are a good speaker, but you haven't polished your skills yet. Deep down, you'd like people to take you seriously. Well, here's your chance!
You hate speaking and listening assessments and think you're going to die every time the teacher says you've got to do one. What you need to remember is that everyone feels just as nervous as you do. They're all just better at pretending.
You are a great speaker. It's not easy, but you take part and overcome your nerves
Improve your public speaking and maybe you'll be TV Presenter one day. But it's not all bad!
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers.
Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 2, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11
b) 4, 1, 3, 10, 6, 9,
1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11
The middle number is 4. Therefore the median is
there are two middle numbers (4 and 6), so we find the mean of these two numbers. The median is therefore:
If there are n numbers, the median will be the (n + 1)  2 = th number
If there are 3 numbers, the median will be the (3 + 1)  2 = 2nd number.
If there are 4 numbers, the median will be the (4 + 1)  2 = 2

425,566,"> Measures of average - The mean
The mean is the most common measure of average.
To calculate the mean add the numbers together and divide the total by the amount of numbers:
Mean = sum of numbers  amount of numbers
Five friends compare their marks in a French test. These are shown below:
Mean = (41 + 54 + 79 + 26 + 65)  5
Check your answer by asking yourself if it looks about right. If you had forgotten to divide by 5 then the answer would have been 265, which would not have made sense. Always check that your answer seems sensible.
A die is thrown 10 times. The following results are obtained:
3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1
To find the answer, add the numbers together and divide by the amount of numbers:
Mean = (3 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 1)  10
How mean are you? Find out with this activity

428,544,"> Representing data - Constructing pie charts
To construct a pie chart you need to work out the fraction of the total that the sector represents. You can then convert this to an angle and draw the sector on the chart.
Constructing pie charts - using a table
The table below shows the grades achieved by 30 pupils in their end-of-year exam.
To show this information in a pie chart, take the following steps:
Work out the total number of pupils
: 7 + 11 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30
To work out the angle of each segment,
work out the fraction of the total that got each grade
There are 360 in a full turn, so to work out the angle,
The grade A sector has an angle of 84
Repeat this process to find the angle of the segments for the other grades
Once you have calculated the angles of the segments, construct the pie chart
Copy and complete the following table, then use the data to construct a pie chart.

The meeting, which starts at two, is in the usual room, but the speaker is arriving at half past one. She will need an overhead projector so get one from Sally because ours is broken. John will start the meeting and you will introduce the speaker, who's going to talk for about half an hour. Someone from staffing will do the displays but you need to register any guests and John will organise coffee and biscuits for afterwards.

431,330,"Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called
Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

434,214,"> Percentages - Percentage of a quantity
It's often useful to be able to find a percentage of a quantity. For example, you might be told that bus fares are going up by 5% and you need to know how much more you will need each week.
Here are a couple of ways you could do it:
Find 1% of the quantity by dividing it by 100.
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying 1% of the quantity by x.
Rakesh has a box containing 60 pens. 20% of the pens are red. How many is that?
You need to find 20% of 60.
1% of 60 is 60  100 = 0.6
So 20% of 60 is 0.6  20 = 12
Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100
This combines the division and multiplication of Method 1 into one sum.
Q1. In a class of 25 pupils, 24% live in a flat. How many pupils live in a flat?
Q2. Last year Sam earned 20,000. This year her pay has increased by 8%.
a) By how much money has Sam's pay increased?

Sometimes you need to rearrange the formula to find the value you're looking for.
The area of a circle (A) is
This is useful if we know the radius of the circle and want to know the area. But what if we want to find the radius?
We need a formula that has r = (some expression in A). We get this by rearranging the A =
[Then find the square root of both sides]
[Swap the sides to make it easier to read]
The formula has been rearranged. We say that now r is
Q1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle: C = 2
Rearrange the formula to make r the subject.
Q2. The formula to convert the temperature in F to the temperature in C is :
Rearrange this formula so that it will convert the temperature in C to the temperature in F (so that f is the subject). Write down your working, then check your answer.
r, so divide both sides by 2
9c = 5(f  32) [multiply by 9]
= f - 32 [divide by 5]

440,600,"When letters in a formula are replaced by numbers, it is called substitution.
For the purpose of measuring time, the Earth's surface is divided into 24 equal wedges of 15, each called time zones and beginning at Greenwich, London (GMT). As you pass over each zone to the
1 hour to GMT, and as you pass over each zone to the
On this basis, call the time in London 'g'.
The formula for working out the time in Bangkok, Thailand is g + 7
And the formula for working out the time in Santiago, Chile, is g - 4
These formulae allow us to substitute 'g' for any time in London to find out the time in Bangkok or Santiago.
Q1. Using the formula above, find the time in Bangkok when it is 14.00 hours in London.
Q2. What time is it in Santiago, Chile, when the time in London is 20.00 hours?
A1. Time in Bangkok = g + 7.
g + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21
So at 14.00 hours in London, the time in Bangkok is
A2. The formula for working out the time in Santiago is g - 4
When g = 20, g - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16
So at 20.00 hours in London, the time in Santiago is
Here is the formula to convert the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (F) to the temperature in degrees Celsius (C)
where f represents the temperature in F.
any F temperature in for f to find its equivalent temperature in C
To find the temperature in C when it is 68F, substitute 68 for the f in the formula.
Remember to work out any calculation in brackets first: (68 - 32) = 36.
A number next to anything in brackets means the contents of the brackets should be multiplied, so 5(36) means 5  36:
What is the temperature in C when it is 77F?

Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge.
The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360.
Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360.
In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14
3 weeks is 3  7 days = 21
4 weeks is 4  7 days = 28
So, the formula to work out the number of days is:
number of days = number of weeks  7

447,34,"Cube numbers are formed by multiplying a digit by itself three times.
For example 2 cubed is 2  2  2 = 8
3 cubed is 3  3  3 = 27
4 cubed is 4  4  4 = 64
Each cube number can be represented by a cube made up of unit cubes.
Use your calculator to find the next six cube numbers (from 5 onwards) - then check your answer.
125 = 5  5  5, 216 = 6  6  6, etc.
So the next six cube numbers are:
125, 216, 343, 512, 729 and 1000

SECTION 2 - Act 3, Scene 1 (whole scene)
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed 
And he's composed of harshness! I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget 
 But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
, who watches from a distance, unseen.
Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down, and rest you. When this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study. Pray, now, rest yourself.
The sun will set before I shall discharge
I'll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that:
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
As well as it does you  and I should do it
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
No, noble mistress. 'Tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you 
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers 
I have broke your hest to say so!
Indeed the top of admiration  worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues
Have I liked several women  never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,
And put it to the foil. But you  o you,
So perfect and so peerless  are created
One of my sex  no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
I am skilless of  but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you 
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts
A prince, Miranda: I do think, a King
I would not so!  and would no more endure
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service  there resides,
To make me slave to it  and for your sake
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event,
If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I,
Beyond all limit of what else i'the world,
To weep at what I am glad of.
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give; and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling 
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife if you will marry me:
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
(He kneels) And I thus humble ever.
As bondage e'er of freedom! Here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised with all  but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book 
For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform

Approximation - Rounding to a given number of places
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point:
So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place.
If it's less than 5 round down
If it's 5 or more, round up
Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.)
Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place
To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down.
To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up.
To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros.
For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p.).
You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places.
Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.

Extract 1 - Act 1, Scene 1, lines 98 to 232
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
Ill pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

If an inequality isn't as straightforward as x > a, or y > b, you need to rearrange the inequality to be able to solve it.
First, you need to get the y values on their own, so minus 1 from each side to give:
To find y, divide both sides by 5 to give:

460,506,"goes roughly through the middle of all the scatter points on a graph. The closer the points are to the line of best fit the stronger the correlation is.
10 pupils in a school study French and German at GCSE. Their marks for a recent test are recorded in the table below:
You can draw a scatter diagram to represent these marks. As Pete was absent on the day of the German test you do not have enough information to mark his score.
Looking at this scatter diagram there is strong positive correlation between the marks in French and the marks in German, so you can draw a line of best fit to show that trend.
Pete scored 70 in French, so using the line of his best fit, you can estimate that his mark in German would have been 72.
A line of best fit can only be drawn if there is strong positive or negative correlation.
The line of best fit does not have to go through the origin.
The line of best fit shows the trend, but it is only approximate and any readings taken from it will be estimations.

or get bigger when they are heated up. They
or get smaller when they are cooled down. This property can be useful.
Thermometers work because the liquid inside them expands and rises up the tube when it gets hotter.
Metal parts can be fitted together without welding using shrink fitting. The animation shows how this works.
The rod is too big to fit through the hole.
Materials expanding and contracting can also cause problems. For example, bridges expand in the summer heat and need special joints to stop them bending out of shape.
When substances expand or contract, their particles stay the same size. It is the

are elements. They react together to form
There are countless different ways for the elements to join together, and millions of compounds are known.
The properties of compounds are usually very different from the properties of the elements they contain. For example hydrogen and oxygen are both gases at room temperature, but water is a liquid.
The reaction between iron and sulfur to make
is often used in school to study elements and compounds. Look at the animation to remind you what happens in this reaction.
A test tube is filled with a mixture of iron and sulfur.
The table compares the properties of iron and sulfur (the two elements), and iron sulfide (the compound).
The atoms in a compound are chemically joined together by strong forces called
. You can only separate the elements in a compound using another chemical reaction. Separation methods like filtration and distillation will not do this.
Compounds form when atoms join together in a chemical reaction

If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4).
If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4).
If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8).
If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40).
Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio.
Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form.
To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28.
2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14.
You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is
No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio.

475,401,"> Listening - Showing you are listening
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made
Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills?
In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background.
In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.
None of them are good listeners and anyway, they shouldn't be chatting in class.
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metals
Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get
This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

478,403,"> Reproduction - Fertilisation and foetal development
During sexual intercourse the man's penis releases semen into the woman's vagina. Sperm cells travel in semen from the penis and into the top of the vagina. They enter the uterus through the cervix and travel to the egg tubes. If a sperm cell meets with an egg cell there, fertilisation can happen. Fertilisation happens when an egg cell meets with a sperm cell and joins with it.
The fertilised egg divides to form a ball of cells called an
. This attaches to the lining of the uterus and begins to develop into a
The foetus relies upon its mother as it develops. These are some of the things it needs:
It also needs its waste substances removing.

across the placenta from the mother to the foetus
waste substances, such as carbon dioxide, diffuse across the placenta from the foetus to the mother.
After nine months the baby is ready to be born. The cervix relaxes and muscles in the wall of the uterus contract, pushing the baby out of the mother's body.

So if you're answering a question, state your point, back it up with a piece of evidence and then explain it.
Try out the PEE method. Here's an extract from 'Holes' about Stanley and the prison work camp.
Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours.
Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.
Check our ideas on the extract by clicking the button below.
He is willing to make the best of a bad situation.
The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys.
Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'.
The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends.
He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.

480,6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.
Dyed cloth in a souk in Marrakesh
Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:
is done using metal or wooden blocks, one for each colour. The background shapes are cut away to leave a raised design on the block. Dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. This is a very slow process used by specialised craft industries.
a pattern is printed onto fabric through a
a sheet of paper, celluloid, or other material in which a design has been cut, so that when ink is passed over the sheet the design is reproduced on the surface below
held in place by a screen. Each screen prints one part of the design in one colour. After printing the dyestuff must be fixed using steam or dry heat.
The graphics show three different types of screen printing.

automates this process, with the fabric moved through the machine on a conveyor belt and the print repeating rapidly.
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
and roller squeegees - one roller for each colour; this is a very fast process used in the continuous printing of furnishing and clothing fabrics.
two fabrics together produces an unfinished seam. Finishing the seam prevents fraying and produces a hard-wearing, neat finish.

resin. Fusing is sometimes done by hand, sometimes by machine.
Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.
is used for synthetic fibres made from thermoplastics, such as polyester or nylon. Heat-sealing is used to set a material into a shape, eg pleats. It is also use to seal the seams on all-weather gear and tents to make them waterproof.
In industry a range of different sewing machines are used for stitching seams, embroidery, buttonholes etc. The main ones are listed in the table below:
Stitches, cuts and finishes seams in one process
Finishing is done to improve a product's appearance, properties and quality. It covers many different processes, some mechanical and some chemical.
Mechanical finishing uses heat, pressure and rollers to improve the appearance of the fabric.

treated with an alkali to improve strength, lustre and receptivity to dye (of cotton)
using caustic soda. Mercerised fabrics are stronger, dye well and have improved lustre.
Wool can be given a shrink-resist finish using silicone or Teflon. This results in soft, smooth, lustrous yarns and fabrics that are machine-washable.
Cotton and viscose fabrics are given a crease-resistant finish using
'raw' plastic, especially when in semi-liquid form (Resistant materials). Substances (eg acrylics and urethanes) which, applied to a fabric's surface, evaporate to leave a film upon it (Textiles technology).

Steam dolly; tunnel finisher; flat-bed press for trousers
Final pressing makes the product ready for sale
Make sure that you can explain any decorative technique you used in your coursework, such as applique, patchwork, tie-dye, batick, quilting or embroidery.These are favourite exam topics!
You may be asked about tools and equipment used for measuring, marking, cutting or sewing fabrics. Again - check your coursework notes.
You may be asked to explain the benefits of using CAM or CNC sewing machines - so make sure you can!

484,391,"The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

, consists of 24 books. Sometimes the
(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) are particularly important. They are also called the
Genesis, the first book of the Jewish scriptures (the
an account of G-d creating the world
In the beginning of G-ds creating the heavens and the earth - when the earth was astonishingly empty, with darkness upon the surface of the deep, and the Divine Presence hovered upon the surface of the waters - G-d said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light.
G-d speaks to Moses through a burning bush and
Hashem answered Moses, 'I Shall Be As I Shall Be.'
This is the first time that G-ds name is given but it is not very clear.
In the Jewish scriptures G-ds name is spelt with four consonants: YHWH. Jewish teaching says that the name is so holy that only the High Priest knew how to pronounce it. When they see these four letters Jews usually say the name Adonai which means 'Lord'. In some parts of the Jewish scriptures the word Hashem is used to avoid writing or saying the name of G-d.
The Jewish Scriptures say that Moses spoke to G-d:
As Moses would arrive at the Tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the Tent, and He would speak with Moses Hashem would speak to Moses face to face, as a man would speak with his fellow.
Although G-d does appear in the scriptures it is only in the
where G-d seems to appear in human form.
So G-d created Man in His image, in the image of G-d He created him; male and female He created them.
They heard the sound of Hashem G-d manifesting itself in the garden toward the evening.

488,3985,"People sometimes say that discrimination is created when prejudice is combined with power. Prejudice is the attitude of someone whose opinion is not based on fact. Prejudice can be triggered by differences of religion, race, colour, sex, language, disability or age. Prejudice is not illegal, as an attitude cant be illegal, but discrimination is illegal.
All forms of discrimination go against the first two Articles of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights:
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

490,3485,"There are four main types of industrial production -
production - which have progressively larger scales of operation. ICT is now important in virtually every type of commercial design and production, with different types of computer-control of design and making processes grouped together as
Computer Aided Design - a system which helps the user produce accurate drawings.
The different production methods may have different design requirements, but most commercial designers have three roles: a
relating to the performance of a product - its 'fitness for purpose'
relating to shape, style, colour, pattern and other aspects of a product's visual appeal
role and an organisational role. Designers need to be aware of the standards and conventions which regulate industrial design practices.
There are four main types of industrial production methods:
is when only one product is made at a time. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive. Products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods.
is when a small quantity of identical products are made - from two up to about 100. Batch production may also use a lot of labour, but jigs and templates are used to aid production. Batches of the product can be made as often as required. Often the machines can be easily changed to produce a batch of a different product.
production is when hundreds of identical products are made, usually on a production line. Mass production often involves the assembly of a number of sub-assemblies of individual components. Some parts may be bought from other companies. There is usually some automation of tasks (eg by using
the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. CNC for short
machines) and this enables a smaller number of workers to ouput more products.
production is when many thousands of copies of identical products are made. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week to maximise production and eliminate the extra costs of starting and stopping the production process. The process is highly automated and few workers are required.
Computer-aided design and making are nowadays commonplace in industry. ICT is most often used in mass production, as computer control makes it possible to produce many identical items very quickly. But ICT is also useful in small batch and even one-off work, as computer control also enables complicated shapes to be produced more accurately than by hand.
The box summarises the many roles of ICT in industry:
Data can be stored electronically and retrieved easily.
Designs can be modelled on-screen and viewed from any angle.
Reaction to outside forces, such as wind flow and pressure can be modelled.
""Zoom"" facilities can allow for the whole product or one detail to be easily seen.
Libraries of standard components can be stored electronically and integrated into new designs.
Control sequences can be simulated before working on the actual material.
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing is usually more accurate.
You need to know and understand a number of terms used to describe aspects of ICT in design and production. They are:
Different production methods - eg, one-off, batch, and mass or continuous production - have somewhat different design requirements, related to the differences between types of product, client expectation, and the scale of operation. In particular there are differences in the relationship between the designer and the
person or organisation that wants a product manufactured - eg a retailer.

individual. Individual products may be made by hand or a combination of hand and machine methods. As every product is different, one-off production is labour intensive.
production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.
production the process of designing is more formalised, but the number of people involved may still be quite small. The client may be the user, but is more likely to be another company who sell the product. The designer will not necessarily have any contact with the end-user of the product.
production method for making hundreds of identical products, usually on a production line. Also called repetitive flow production.
production method for making many thousands of identical products. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
flow production the processes of designing and manufacturing are much more formal. Making of changes can become slower. There is little or no contact between the designer and the client. The designer is therefore dependent on other people feeding back the end-users' views.

Market research is the gathering of data or information concerning consumer opinions about a product or service

direct mail (ads sent out in the form of leaflets, mail shots, emails and texts)
Industrial design and manufacturing processes of products must conform with the following

guidelines or specifications which are widely agreed and commonly accepted, but do not necessarily have the force of law
, designed to protect consumers from inferior, misleading or unsafe goods and services:
law which protects consumers where the following are not acting in their interest: monopolies, where businesses have 25 percent of the market, mergers, where two companies plan to join together, and rogue traders, where the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) will take action against persistent offenders. In 2003 the Enterprise Act replaced the Fair Trading Act.
law which protects the public by: prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods, making the maker or seller of defective products pay for damage it causes and allows councils to seize or suspend the sale unsafe goods.
law which makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers.

Conventions are ways of doing things - for example, technical drawings - which conform to a common standard. Using conventions saves time and ensures that a drawing means the same thing to anyone who sees it. The BSI standard for drawings is

492,6135,"What to look for in your comparison
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.
language to help us 'hear' events in the poem - Temper, temper... Blue murder. Hopkins uses different techniques -
Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.
Words that sound the same through the use of similar vowels or consonants, eg hot and slop or fold and filled.
The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.

Anne Hathaway's love of Shakespeare is confident and will last forever - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head - while Hopkins' is more tentative - he fears for the future and asks What would the world be? without the wilderness his poem evokes.

 at first, railways used stationary steam engines to wind wagons up banks. Then in 1800, Trevithick invented the steam-powered locomotive. The first steam-powered boat was built in 1802. This had significant effects, not only on industry and agriculture and the transport of goods, but on the transport of people and their mobility and social lives (eg holidays at the seaside).
 the steam engines used coal, so industry was located on the coalfields.
 steam engines were expensive, so mainly large firms could afford them. The steam engines allowed large-scale production.
 the steam engines never flagged or stopped, so this required significant changes in the way people worked. There was now no requirement for workers to be strong or skilled and, if a person was big, it could now be a disadvantage. The steam-powered machine did all the work, so children replaced men as the key workers in industry.

It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.

496,3857,"We often use formulas without even noticing. For example, we might convert miles to km by multiplying by 1.6, or find the circumference of a circle by multiplying pi by the diameter.
km = 1.6 x miles is an example of a formula.
We have already seen that km = 1.6 x miles and C =
 d are examples of formulas. There are many others that we use regularly in other subjects. Sometimes we have to construct our own formula:
A taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00. Write down a formula for the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles.
Travelling 1 mile would cost 2 + 50p.
Travelling 2 miles would cost 2 + 2 x 50p.
Travelling 3 miles would cost 2 + 3 x 50p.
So travelling for 'n' miles will cost 2 + n x 50p.
The formula is C = 2 + (n x 50p)
A rectangle has a width of x and a length of 2x.
Write down a formula for the perimeter (P) in terms of x.
P = 2x + x + 2x + x
Did you remember to include all 4 sides?
To recap, the cost (C) of hiring this taxi to travel n miles, when a taxi firm charges 50p per mile plus a fixed charge of 2.00 is:-
C = 2 + (n x 50p)
To find the cost of the taxi for a journey of 20 miles, replace 'n' with 20.
C = 2 + (20 x 50p)
What is the cost of hiring this taxi for 16 miles?
Remember that C = 2 + (16 x 50p)
The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]

497,5853,"New farming techniques and selective breeding ideas were introduced to Britain after 1750. These ideas helped to improve crop production and the quality of meat.
This Revision Bite will identify the main improvements made to agricultural techniques and the people responsible for these improvements.
began to reach Britain from abroad. Most of these ideas came from Holland and Denmark. At first, the ideas were not popular, but they soon started to spread across Britain because the farmers using them were making good profits.
Changes in farming techniques during this period were connected with:
that allowed better quality crops to be grown.
to produce bigger cattle and better meat.
Agricultural improvers played an important role in changing and improving British farming techniques. Improvers were divided into three categories:
- people who worked to improve the land.
- people who worked to improve the quality of cattle.
- people who worked to spread new ideas about farming techniques.
He popularised new techniques and proved that they were more profitable. He:
(wheat, turnips, barley, clover) to Britain. Turnips were used as a cleansing crop to allow the land to be hoed to kill the weeds, and clover was grown to replace the nutrients in the soil that the crops had depleted. This rotation prevented land from lying
An area of land which is left unseeded ie crops are not planted and left to grow.
and both turnips and clover were fodder crops, which could be fed to animals to allow more of them to survive cold winters.
, which mixed rich subsoil with a poorer sandy soil to produce better quality crops and increasingly more profit.
to encourage them to invest more money to experiment with new ideas and improving their land.
He is important because he introduced ideas that others went on to develop.
that planted seeds at the same depth in straight lines. This wasted less seeds and allowed farmers to manage their crops more easily.
that made it easier for farmers to weed between their seed rows.
In 1731, he wrote a book called ""
He was a pioneering selective breeder. His new methods were simple:
and bred from them. His most successful animals were the
New Leicester Sheep and the Dishley Longhorn cattle
. They were bigger animals, but they did not have better meat.
about his livestock, made sure they were very healthy and their stables and pens were always clean.
He was so successful that other farmers often hired his animals to breed from.
describing his new breeding techniques and their advantages.
They were also selective breeders, but not as well known as Robert Bakewell.
They improved on Robert Bakewell's methods and their main success was breeding the
, which were able to produce large amounts of milk and high quality lean meat for sale at market.
He was a propagandist for agricultural improvement who was convinced that Britain needed a strong agricultural community.
Young traveled around the country and some parts of Europe, writing
and also edited an agricultural journal called ""The Annals of Agriculture"".
secretary of the new Board of Agriculture
and encouraged the spread of new agricultural techniques and ideas.
Thomas William Coke - 1st Earl of Leicester
He was a Norfolk landowner who adopted and spread new agricultural methods on his farm in Norfolk.
to encourage them to try out new methods. He believed that if his tenant farmers felt they owned the land for a significant period of time, they would be more willing to invest in it.
Coke encouraged farmers to use the new techniques by
on his estate that demonstrated the newest methods. One such event was called Coke's Clipping. This was a competition to see how quickly a sheep could be sheared.
He was important for sharing and spreading new farming ideas.
Most examination boards will want you to answer a question about how important the different improvers were to the agricultural revolution. You need to revise at least two facts about each of the improvers so that you can answer either a three-mark question, or combine all your facts to answer an essay question worth 15 marks.
As part of your revision, think about the
the different agriculturalists improved farming in Great Britain.

498,3778,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
, you need to think about the ideas and attitudes in the poem, and then decide how you would read it aloud.
in a bitter way, suggesting Robin is angry that Batman prevented him from growing up for so long
in a thoughtful way, suggesting that Robin is reflecting on his experiences with Batman
triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last.
Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...
This phrase suggests respect for Batman's skills.

Any piece of writing. More widely, a text can be anything that conveys meaning - eg, a film, tv programme, advert, website, or image.
. A text may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text - it becomes something more significant, because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the text, to work out what lies beneath its surface.
The title of the book comes from a poem by the 18th century Scottish poet Robbie Burns. It is about a mouse which carefully builds a winter nest in a wheat field, only for it to be destroyed by a ploughman. It is written in Scots

The mouse had dreamed of a safe, warm winter and is now faced with the harsh reality of cold, loneliness and possible death. There is a parallel here with George and Lennie's joyful fantasy of a farm of their own, and its all-too-predictable destruction at the end of the story. Perhaps the is also meant to suggest to us how unpredictable our lives are, and how vulnerable to

Crooks was a proud, aloof man... ""Why you ain't wanted?"" Lennie asked. ""'Cause I'm black.""
The two main themes in 'Of Mice and Men' - foreshadowed by the reference to Burns' mouse - are loneliness and dreams. They interlock: people who are lonely have most need of dreams to help them through.
Study the table below, showing both the loneliness and the dreams of each of the main characters. You could use a table like this as the basis for an exam answer about

Loneliness and Dreams in Of Mice and Men
George is not lonely during the novel, as he has Lennie. He will be lonely afterwards, without his best friend.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. He is so set on the idea that he even knows of some land that he thinks they could buy.
Lennie is the only character who is innocent enough not to fear loneliness, but he is angry when Crooks suggests George won't come back to him.
George and Lennie share a dream - to own a little patch of land and live on it in freedom. Lennie's main desire is to tend the soft-haired rabbits they will keep.
She is married to a man she doesn't love and who doesn't love her. There are no other women on the ranch and she has nothing to do. She tries to befriend the men by hanging round the bunkhouse.
She dreams of being a movie star. Her hopes were raised by a man who claimed he would take her to Hollywood, but when she didn't receive a letter from him, she married Curley.
When Candy's ancient, ill dog was shot, Candy has nothing left. He delayed killing the dog, even though he knew deep down that it was the best thing, as he dreaded losing his long-time companion.
Candy joins George and Lennie's plan of owning a piece of land. His savings make the dream actually possible to achieve.
Crooks lives in enforced solitude, away from the other men. He is bitter about being a back-busted nigger. He is thrilled when Lennie and Candy come into his room and are his companions for a night.
Crooks dreams of being seen as equal to everyone else. He knows his civil rights. He remembers fondly his childhood, when he played with white children who came to his family's chicken ranch, and longs for a similar relationship with white people again.

506,1912,"You should remember from your Key Stage 3 studies that white light can be split up into a spectrum of many different colours. You should know that visible light is just part of a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.
White light can be split up to form a spectrum using a

of the light the more it is
There is refraction when waves change direction as they move from one transparent substance to another.
. As a result, red light is refracted the least and violet light is refracted the most, causing the coloured light to spread out to form a spectrum.
Visible light is just one type of
. There are various types of electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths of light than red light and with shorter wavelengths than violet light. All the different types of electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through the vacuum of empty space.
You should know the different types of
The table summarises the main types of electromagnetic radiation and a typical use for each of them.
Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the
of empty space. In a vacuum, they all travel with the same very high speed: 300 000 000 m/s.
A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.
Different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are used for different purposes due to their varying characteristics in reflection, absorption and transmission by various materials.
. X-rays mostly pass through skin and soft tissue, but they do not easily pass through bone or metal. X-rays are used to produce shadow photographs of bones to check for damage such as fractures. They are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage, and can detect objects hidden in the luggage of aircraft passengers.
Even low doses of X-rays can cause cells to become cancerous, so precautions are taken in hospitals to limit the dose received by patients and staff when X-ray photographs are taken.
Because these can travel long distances through glass without becoming significantly weaker, these are used in

Microwave radiation has lower frequencies and longer

than visible light. Microwaves with certain wavelengths are absorbed by water molecules and can be used for
. Water in the food absorbs the microwave radiation, which causes the water to heat up and cook the food. The water in living cells can also absorb microwave radiation. As a result, they can be killed or damaged by the heat released.

Microwave radiation can also be used to
such as mobile phone calls. Microwave transmitters and receivers on buildings and masts communicate with the mobile telephones in their range.
Certain microwave radiation wavelengths pass through the Earth's atmosphere and can be used to transmit information to and from
microwaves well. For this reason, satellite dishes are made from metal, and so are the cases of microwave ovens.

509,6661,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.
Is minteoir scoile  fosta ach n bheidh s ag obair sa scoil i mbliana. Beidh s ag obair leis an pheil i mbliana. Deir daoine nach mbeidh s ag imirt peile ar an bhliain seo chugainn. Nl s iontach g agus sleann daoine go bhfuil s measartha aosta anois. Is fidir go n-ireoidh s as an pheil mar go bhfuil s aosta.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.
- acla; suim mhr sa pheil; Earagail Chiarin agus Tr Eoghain; peileadir iontach maith, sciliil; dograiseach; ag traenil gach l.
- minteoir corpoideachais, menscoil i gCo. Thr Eoghain; N bheidh s ag teagasc i mbliana; obair leis an pheil; an bhliain seo chugainn; r-aosta.
- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

511,5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

512,4312,"The development of steam power was crucial to the Industrial Revolution because it was the main source of power that operated the machinery used in industry.
The developments in equipment helped to increase production, formed the basis of railway transport and introduced new machinery for agriculture.
The Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the steam engine.
in 1696, as many books claim. Saverys engine filled a cylinder with steam, and then cooled it, thereby condensing it. This created a vacuum that sucked up water from the mine.
first used in a mine in Dudley in 1712. He used the vacuum created by condensing the steam to power a piston. The piston was attached to pump rods, which worked a pump to pump out the mines.
took the steam engine and developed it further. The improvements he made created the machine that became the basis of all the power in the Industrial Revolution. Watts inventions included:
cooled the steam by exhausting it into a separate chamber
. The cylinder could, therefore, always be kept hot and the separate condenser always cool. This meant huge amounts of fuel were saved.
Turned the up-and-down motion of the piston into a rotary motion
, which allowed the steam engine to be used to power machinery and wheels.
and used steam pressure to force the piston both ways. This invention became the basis of the steam train.
Regulated the admission of steam into the cylinder
, which not only made the engines safer, but meant they could be kept at a regular speed.

- the Bolsheviks gave the land previously owned by the nobles to the peasants, and factories were handed over to workers' committees.
- the Bolsheviks banned religion; brought in an eight-hour day for workers, as well as unemployment pay and pensions; abolished the teaching of history and Latin, while encouraging science; and allowed divorce.
- there was a huge campaign to teach everyone to read. Agit trains' went around the country showing communist newsreels and giving lectures to teach peasants about Communism.

Renaissance knowledge about the body and disease
The Early Modern Age was an exciting time for medicine, with knowledge of the human body progressing in fundamental ways - although the causes of disease remained a mystery.
Two key practitioners moved knowledge forwards in the Early Modern Age:
Follower of Vesalius in graveyard, searching for bodies to dissect
, whose patron was Charles V of Spain. He trained at Louvain, Paris and Padua universities, and ransacked cemeteries and gibbets for bones and for bodies to dissect.
. He also realised that the famous doctor Galen could be wrong, when he discovered that the great man was mistaken about there being two bones in the jaw, and about how muscles were attached to the bone.
He became professor of medicine at Padua University. He said that medical students should perform
""... our true book of the human body is man himself.""
He published 'Fabric of the Human Body' (with high-quality annotated illustrations).
- who discovered the principle of the
through the body. He trained at Cambridge and Padua universities, and became doctor to James I and Charles I of England.
He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.

518,4008,"Sometimes, rather than rounding off to the nearest whole number, you might need to be a little more accurate. You might need to include some of the digits after the decimal point.
In these cases, we can round off the number up to a certain number of decimal places.
Do not confuse this with rounding off using significant figures (intermediate), as this is slightly different!
The same rules for rounding up apply here:
Write 2.6470588 to 2 decimal places (dp).
? You needed to round up. We want 2 decimal places.
decimal digit is 4. So the number lies between 2.64 and 2.65
The next digit is 7, so we have to round up. So the answer is
, giving your answer correct to one decimal place.
We need one decimal place. That means one number after the decimal point. The 1
number after the decimal point is 8.
This means the answer lies between 7.8 and 7.9
The next digit is 7. This means we have to round up.
Round off the number 3.9762645 to 1 dp.
The number lies between 3.9 and 4.0. The 7 after the 9 means you have to round up. So the answer is

a logarithmic scale used to measure the impact of an earthquake
The effects of an earthquake can be devastating - they can destroy settlements, change landscapes, and cause many deaths.
is the shaking and vibration of the Earth's crust due to movement of the Earth's plates (plate tectonics). Earthquakes can happen along any type of plate boundary.
Earthquakes occur when tension is released from inside the crust. Plates do not always move smoothly alongside each other and sometimes get stuck. When this happens pressure builds up. When this pressure is eventually released, an earthquake tends to occur.
The point inside the crust where the pressure is released is called the focus. The point on the Earth's surface above the

We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created.
She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil.
Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone.
Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

523,2527,"Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
Think about all the different things you need to do for each task, and the order they need to be done in, and add them to your overall plan. Allocate a number to each main task and give each sub-task a number or letter to show which main task it is part of, and where it is in the order. For example:
Task 3: Produce a formal letter to a newspaper explaining why animal experiments might be necessary.
Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
You could write this plan on paper and scan it before saving it on your computer. You could also write it straight onto the computer using a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mind mapping application or other suitable software.

526,5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

527,7341,"When there is a chemical reaction, air pollutants are produced. You can understand how these pollutants are formed by looking at what happens to atoms during these chemical reactions.
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
tells you how many atoms of each element the molecule contains. The table below shows the formulae of some compounds, together with the number of atoms of each element in each molecule and a diagram of each molecule.
The table shows the formulae of some compounds, with the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
A small (subscript) number after a symbol tells you how many atoms of that particular element are in the molecule. If there is only one atom of an element in a molecule, we do not write the number 1 after the symbol. For example, the water molecule H

529,2529,"is not just a book about a man who creates a Monster. Mary Shelley intended her readers to learn from her tale. It contains many of her ideas on how people should behave. These were shaped by her upbringing, relationship with Shelley, and her reading of the works of many famous authors and philosophers. These ideas can be summed up in the main
The novel begins with Walton describing his own voyage of discovery, which he hopes will lead him to the North Pole. On meeting Victor, he hears of another tale of discovery, that of the secret of creating life itself.
The Monster is also on a path of self-discovery, and all three characters share a powerful desire to acquire knowledge - a desire that ultimately leads two of them to their deaths, and which very nearly kills Walton.
The Monster quite naturally seeks knowledge about where it came from and how to survive in a hostile world. Through patient
, it learns how to speak and read. But the knowledge it gains only leads it to curse its existence.
It knows that it can never be accepted in the world of man, yet craves human company and the love of the father who abandoned it. Finally, through learning of the 'sanguinary (bloody) laws of man', the Monster is taught that it can be acceptable to kill in some circumstances. This knowledge leads to the deaths of many innocent people.
Robert Walton was brought up by his uncle, and is self-taught in the art of sea-faring. This is despite his father's dying wish that his uncle forbid him from embarking on a life at sea. His determination to succeed, shown by his willingness to work ""harder than the common sailors during the day (and devote his) nights to the study of mathematics medicine... and physical sciences"", leads him to believe he can be the first to discover the sea passage to the North Pole. However, his real motivation is self-glory, fuelled by overwhelming ambition. This leads to him failing to assess the dangers of his voyage and knowingly putting the lives of his crew at risk.
Victor Frankenstein also puts others' lives at risk, as well as his own, through his ambitious pursuit of knowledge. He neglects his loving family and allows his health to suffer greatly in his obsession to discover the secret of creating life out of death.
Shelley makes it clear she believes knowledge such as this cannot lead to good. Some benefit may have come from finding a way to the North Pole, but no good is shown to come from Victor's creation of the Monster.
She shows Victor's 'success' to have severe and tragic consequences that should serve as a warning to scientists, past, present and future, that knowledge is a very dangerous thing and should only be used for the good of mankind - and certainly not personal gain.

530,1024,"How can we know if there is something we call God?
How can we know if there is something we call God?
There are five main arguments used to give proof that God exists. These arguments are usually applied to Christianity.
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
. Therefore God (like unicorns) exists in the mind.
It is not possible to think of any being greater than God (as God is
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
). Therefore God must exist in reality.
Everything has to come from something. You cannot make something out of nothing.
Therefore there must have been a First Cause that created the something (the universe). That First Cause is God.
If you were walking on a heath and saw a watch on the ground you would assume that its parts had not come together by chance because it is too ordered and complicated. Therefore someone must have designed it or it would not work.
Because the universe is also ordered and complicated, someone must have designed that too. That 'someone' is God.
Some people claim that they have had a religious experience eg, a miracle (a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention), a vision, or a particular prayer to God answered.
Some people say that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong. They describe this as having a sense of morality.
This sense of morality has to come from somewhere, and the only possible source is God. Therefore God exists.

531,4254,"The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]
See if you can do it better than Einstein!

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.
of the part of atmosphere (air) closest to the surface of the earth.
The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called
The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called
. People who study the weather and climate are known as meteorologists.

542,5167,"Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

543,6076,"Farmers started to work scientifically for the first time during the 1830s. Many new improvements were the result of individuals, such as Justus von Liebig, experimenting, observing and explaining how crop yields could be enlarged and improved.
The main improvements introduced in the 1830s, which were the main characteristics of High Farming, covered fertilisers, drainage and steam power coupled with support from government initiatives.
Illustration of a bird with guano (bird droppings)
- a scientist called Sir John Lawes started the production and use of phosphate fertilisers and super phosphates, which were initially by-products of industrial processes. The other most commonly used fertiliser from the 1830s onwards was guano (bird droppings) from the Andes Mountains in Peru. Soil in Britain became richer and produced higher yields as a result.
- new steam-operated machines were invented that could lay drainage pipes in straight lines. These drainage pipes cleared water from flooded fields and subsequently improved the quality of agricultural land in Great Britain.
- steam became the new method of powering farming machinery, which made the agricultural process more efficient. Examples of new steam-powered machinery included ploughs, seed drills, threshing machines and from 1852 onwards, steam-powered reapers. Unfortunately, most of these new steam-powered machines were invented in America and were not practical for use on the smaller enclosed British fields in the late 19th century.
- for the very first time, the government gave out 28 million in loans to help farmers use these new techniques and ideas on their fields. The government also forced remaining open land to be enclosed.

544,2508,"German 19th-century scholar, who founded Marxism (key theory of Communism).
People should contribute to the public wealth according to their ability, but receive according to their needs.
The means of production should be owned equally by the whole community (hence communism), not as in capitalism where individuals (who might be very rich) own the means of production and leave the rest of society to be poor and oppressed wage slaves.
A deterministic interpretation of history, which said that society must inevitably develop through successive stages of slavery, feudalism, then capitalism, ending up with the violent overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a communist society.
They should work to overthrow capitalism throughout the world by means of a revolution by the proletariat (workers).
Class was a feature of capitalist society, and should be destroyed and replaced by a society of equals.
The economy should be planned - controlled by the government.
Lenin changed Marx's ideas to add that a Communist government first had to be a dictatorship which was essential in order to bring in the communist state safely.

545,2621,"In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.
between generations, both from the point of view of the older generation.
The young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.
Both poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.
Margaret's love for her child is clearly genuine - the parents 'love' in the Duffy poem rings hollow.

549,3989,"The practical Egyptians seem to have been able to perform some surgical operations - and they have left enough information behind them to tell us a little about it.
. They could reset dislocated joints, and they could mend broken bones.
As long as the problem was on the surface of the skin, Egyptian surgery could deal with it quite effectively. Egyptian doctors were
- we know that they bound willow leaves into the bandages of patients with inflamed wounds (willow has antiseptic properties). They could also stitch wounds.
Archaeologists have found stone carvings in Egypt showing

Source A: Instructions for treating a broken nose
If you examine a man whose nose is disfigured - part of it being squashed in while the other part is swollen and both his nostrils are bleeding, then you shall say: ""You have a broken nose and this is an ailment I can treat.""
You should clean his nose with two plugs of linen and then insert two plugs soaked in grease into his nostrils. You should make him rest until the swelling has gone down. You should bandage his nose with stiff rolls of linen and treat him with lint every day until he recovers.
Source B: Instructions for treating swellings in the body
When you come across a swelling of the flesh in any part of the body of a patient and your patient is clammy and the swelling comes and goes under the finger, then you must say to your patient: ""It is a tumour of the flesh. I will treat the disease. I will try to heal it with fire since cautery heals.""
When you come across a swelling that has attacked a channel, then it has formed a tumour in the body. If when you examine it with your fingers, it is like a hard stone, then you should say: ""It is a tumour of the channels. I shall treat the disease with a knife.""
Once you have read the sources on Egyptian surgery, look for evidence that the Egyptians:

Je viens de lire l'article ""Visiter l'Angleterre? Non, merci!"" dans votre journal. Quelle injustice!
A mon avis les Anglais sont trs travailleurs. Mon pre travaille six jours par semaine, neuf heures par jour. Hier je suis all au collge aprs avoir distribu des journaux pour gagner de l'argent. Je pense que les Anglais travaillent trop!
Mes grands-parents disent que quand ils taient jeunes, la cuisine anglaise tait mauvaise: mais maintenant on mange bien. Prs de chez moi il y a des restaurants chinois, italiens, indiens et franais, et ils sont tous excellents. Chez nous, mon pre fait un grand effort pour aider aux repas. Samedi dernier, par exemple, il a prpar des ptes avec une sauce dlicieuse.
En ce qui concerne le temps, je suis d'accord qu'il fait plus beau en France. Je n'aime pas notre hiver parce qu'il fait froid et gris. Par contre, il fait souvent chaud en t. L'anne dernire, par exemple, il a fait un temps superbe jusqu'au mois d'octobre.
S'il vous plat, voulez-vous montrer cette lettre  l'auteur de l'article?

553,5674,"When chemicals react with each other, different chemicals are made. One of the best ways to describe what is happening is by writing a chemical equation.
A chemical equation tells you which chemicals reacted together (the
) and the new chemicals that were made in the reaction (the
The simplest equation is a word equation. For example:
A symbol equation gives more information about what is happening in the reaction:
Each of the reactants and products is shown as a formula. This formula shows how many atoms of each element are present.
The formula for sodium is Na - the same as its symbol.
, because the halogens exist as molecules of two atoms (
Each of the Group 1 halides has a formula with one symbol for the metal and one for the halogen. So, for sodium chloride the formula is NaCl.
The numbers in front of the formulae are there to
the equation. This gives the same number of atoms of each element on each side of the equation.
For the exam you will be expected to know the following formulae:
Halides of Group 1 metals - for example:

554,4837,"Nuclear fusion involves two atomic nuclei joining to make a large nucleus. Energy is released when this happens.
The Sun and other stars use nuclear fusion to release energy. The sequence of nuclear fusion reactions in a star is complex, but overall hydrogen nuclei join to form helium nuclei. Here is one nuclear fusion reaction that takes place:
hydrogen-1 nuclei fuse with hydrogen-2 nuclei to make helium-3 nuclei

555,4343,"All the alkali metals react vigorously with cold water. In each reaction,
is produced. The speed and violence of the reaction
as you go down the group. This shows that the reactivity of the alkali metals increases as you go down Group 1.
When lithium is added to water, lithium floats. It fizzes steadily and becomes smaller, until it eventually disappears.
lithium + water  lithium hydroxide + hydrogen
When sodium is added to water, the sodium melts to form a ball that moves around on the surface. It fizzes rapidly, and the hydrogen produced may burn with an orange flame before the sodium disappears.
sodium + water  sodium hydroxide + hydrogen
When potassium is added to water, the metal melts and floats. It moves around very quickly on the surface of the water. The hydrogen ignites instantly. The metal is also set on fire, with sparks and a lilac flame. There is sometimes a small explosion at the end of the reaction.
potassium + water  potassium hydroxide + hydrogen
The hydroxides formed in all of these reactions dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. These solutions turn universal indicator purple, showing they are strongly

When comparing and contrasting two artworks like these, think about their
What is each painting about? What is each artist trying to represent or say?
How does the subject matter differ between the two paintings?
How has each artist used paint to show how they feel about their subject matter?
How have time and/or place influenced each artist?
Does it look like the artist has used a brush or palette knife to apply the paint?
Does the way in which each artist has used the paint affect the mood, atmosphere or the way it looks?
Does the size of either of the paintings affect the viewer?
What (painting) devices does Justin Mortimer use to show Mick Scarletts personality. How does he show his response to and feelings about him?
How does Robert Maclaurin show that the atmosphere and mood of a place is more important to him than the accurate recording of its details?

surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more
and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too.
Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring.
Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based.
experiment with the surface you are painting on
. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way.
Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed
. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more.
Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be.
Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures.
Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint.
When you are experimenting have an idea in mind of what you want to achieve, and then see what techniques give you the most success.

, such as different thicknesses, types and textures of paper. Experiment to see the difference it makes what type of marks you use to draw the same subject. Try making marks that are all the same all over. Then try to get a wide range of different marks into the same drawing.
a collective name for images, video and audio
. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water.
Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind.

560,1615,"is part of a line which has two end points (ie, it is not infinite). Each end of a line segment is usually labelled with letters.
If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y
And the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of X and Y.

562,3045,"There were two types of water transport available in Britain before the 18th century - coastal shipping and navigable rivers. However, although both these methods were useful, they still had their problems, so something new was needed...
Bad weather was a risk of coastal shipping
, but ships could be affected by tides, winds and pirates.
Heavy goods such as coal and iron could only be transported by coastal shipping and not by roads.
Some rivers had to be widened and deepened for large ships
Rivers that were large enough and deep enough to link towns and cities in Britain were called navigable rivers.
The main navigable rivers in Britain were the Thames, Severn, Humber, Trent and Mersey.
rivers were widened and deepened by local communities
While coastal shipping and navigable rivers were useful, there needed to be a more effective form of transport than roads and the existing water transport. The main reasons for change were:
during winter and dry up during summer months.
did not always link the major towns
A rapidly growing population also needed a more efficient method of transport because
canals would be the next step forward
Read this Revision Bite and then attempt to write down the information that you consider to be
for revising the early problems with pre-18th century water transport.
As part of your revision, think carefully about the

- which is thought to be a major cause of global warming.
When fossil fuels are burnt - by industry, in power stations and in vehicles and planes - the gases enter the
The Earth's atmosphere is the envelope of gasses that surround the Earth. The gasses are held there by the Earth's gravity. The important gasses in the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide.
. Although these gases have always been present in the world's atmosphere, their concentration is gradually increasing as more and more fossil fuels are burnt.
Scientists believe that the build-up of these so-called
The main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. They are naturally occurring in atmosphere, but are believed to have increased through burning more oil, petrol, and coal, while forests have been removed.
in the atmosphere acts like a blanket or greenhouse around the planet; heat is trapped inside the Earth's atmosphere. This is the
, and the resulting increase in global temperatures is called
It's thought that the build-up of greenhouse gases impacts on global temperature in two ways:
The gases allow more of the sun's rays to enter the atmosphere. Some
Energy from the sun - consisting of visible light, heat or infra-red radiation, ultra-violet and other forms of radiation.
is still reflected back into space by the outer parts of the atmosphere, but it's believed the amount reflected back is gradually reducing.
At the same time, the greenhouse gases absorb more of the solar radiation that is reflected back from the Earth's surface - trapping heat and keeping it in the atmosphere. The ability of the atmosphere to capture the sun's warmth is essential for life on earth. But if significantly MORE warmth is being captured, this is bad news for the planet.
Another group of greenhouse gases includes the
for short). CFCs have been responsible for depleting the
ozone layer as they attack and destroy ozone molecules.
The ozone layer is a high level layer of gas in the stratosphere. The ozone helps to keep out harmful ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn on human skin and damage plants.
The resulting ozone holes let harmful ultra-violet radiation in and add to the greenhouse effect.
CFCs can be used in aerosols, such as hairspray cans, fridges and in making foam plastics.
CFCs were banned in many countries in the mid-1990s after it was found that they were breaking up the Earth's ozone.

Drawing 1: Sketching, enhancing, shapes and charts
There are a range of techniques for enhancing the appearance of a drawing, making it look more like the real object. The technique used will depend on the type of drawing and what you are trying to show.
For this technique, thin lines are used in between adjoining surfaces. Thick lines are suitable when only one side can be seen. The drawing illustrates the idea.
of the same colour. A lighter tone is called a tint and is made by adding white to the base colour. A darker tone is called a shade and is made by adding black to the base colour.
Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones.
There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour.
Colour is an important part of graphic design. You need to know the following facts about colour.
are made by mixing the primary colours as follows: red + yellow = orange; red + blue = violet; blue + yellow = green.
Mixing primary and secondary colours together creates tertiary colours. These are dark browns, greens and greys.
The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.
The colours next to each other harmonise (go together). Use harmonising colours to make elements of a design look related to each other.
Colours that are on opposite sides of the wheel contrast with each other (they are 'complementary' colours). Use contrasting colours to make elements of a design stand out from each other.
Yellow, orange and red are 'warm' colours; green and blue are 'cold'. Warm colours appear to come towards you from the page, while cold colours appear to recede.

566,3753,"The arrival of the railway network had a huge impact on Britain. The railways gave people the ability to travel around the country quickly and made different areas more accessible.
The railways brought social, political and economic changes.

568,73,"Information technology has led to many changes in how we work, where we work and even when we work. It has had a dramatic effect on our working lives.
Until the mid-90s it was not possible to shop online. The closest alternative was shopping by phone.
The same was true for banking and all the host of Government and other services which now exist online.
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
an application that allows users to send instant messages (text) to one another
Instead of mobile phones there was a trend for CB (Citizen's Band) radio.
Documents could not be sent as email
a file that's 'attached' to an email is called an attachment
and were faxed instead (a paper document is digitised, sent down a phone line, and then printed at the other end).
The need to travel for essential services, eg banking, was far greater for those who lived outside town.
Today, customers expect even the smallest of businesses to have a professional, informative
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
. Businesses that have failed to embrace the advancement of communications and ICT have put themselves at a disadvantage.
It is now common for adverts to include a

address in addition to, or even instead of a phone number.
The introduction of information technology has caused some unemployment, for example:
Computer-controlled warehouses need only a handful of staff to operate them.
Computer-controlled robots are now common on production lines, replacing human workers.
The old skills of workers in the printing industry are now out-of-date.
Some jobs have disappeared as they can now be done automatically, eg marking multiple choice exam papers.
However, it is fair to say that the development of information technology has led to many new jobs such as computer technicians, programmers,

IT is more likely to have changed someone's work rather than led to them losing their job. People in certain professions have had to be retrained to make use of modern technology:
Travel agents book holidays by computer, not by phone or letter.
has meant that many bank staff now work by phone in front of a computer, instead of being in a branch, behind a counter.
De-skilling has taken place. Some jobs which needed a high level of skill in the past can now be done more easily. For example, print workers today can use
an application that allows text and images to be laid out on a page
used extensively in the automotive industry, aerospace industry, and in architectural design to draw 2D and 3D designs
rather than pencil and paper on a drawing board.
Products made with computers should be of a better quality than before. For example, car bodies are welded more accurately by robots than by humans.
Robots don't get tired so the quality of work is consistent.
Machines controlled by computer are more reliable than those controlled by humans.
Miniaturisation - many electrical items, such as mobile phones and video cameras have become much smaller due to developments in technology.
High street stores now find themselves competing with each other for business both on the high street and online.
opens the market to customers nationally and internationally
enables smaller companies to compete with larger companies
reduces in staffing and/or high street stores thereby reducing costs
provides the option to offer 24 hour shopping at minimum additional cost
- businesses once competing with the shop in the next town now find themselves competing on a global scale.
- with increased competition, local companies may have to reduce their work force.
- the move to e-commerce may not be a smooth one and will certainly require a degree of investment.
- if high street stores are closed in an effort to save money, customers who prefer to shop on the high street may not be comfortable buying online so may go elsewhere.
Now, both for companies and individuals, there is pressure to have Internet access to do everyday things such as submit orders or look up details in a catalogue. There are initiatives to make as many services available on the Internet as possible, including e-government, where government departments such as the Inland Revenue can be dealt with using secure
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
, means working from home using modern technology to keep in touch with your business. Jobs can be relocated to places where it is more attractive, more convenient or cheaper to live.
a global network connecting millions of computers
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
a technology used to digitise hard copies of documents, transfer them across the telephone network, and print them on receipt
Office running costs and overheads (rates, electricity, heating etc) can be reduced, which in turn may reduce the need for office space.
Travel-related problems may be reduced, ie staff being unable to get into work due to rail/road delays.
It may tempt better staff to come and work for the company.
Employers need to be able to trust their staff and be prepared to have less direct control over them.
work in a comfortable environment - their home
less human interaction - fewer opportunities to meet people, share ideas with etc.
more difficult to work as part of a team, especially if they're all office based
greater temptation to spend time on non-work-related activities
difficult to separate personal life from work
Video conferencing means using computers to provide a video-link between two or more people. Instead of just talking to someone by telephone, you are able to see them as well.
The following is needed to take part in a video conference call:
a microphone (most webcams have a microphone built-in)
a global network connecting millions of computers
a general term used to describe an application or a program
It is possible to buy a special video conferencing machine just for this purpose.
Meetings can take place without leaving the office.
Travel costs and the time taken to travel can be reduced significantly.
Meetings can be called instantly worldwide with little notice.
Delegates can still attend meetings even if they are physically unable to.
May not be as productive as a discussion around a table.

An ionic compound occurs when a negative ion (an atom that has gained an electron) joins with a positive ion (an atom that has lost an electron). The ions swap electrons to achieve a full outer shell.
, while chloride ions have the formula Cl
. You need to show one sodium ion and one chloride ion. In the exam, make sure the dots and crosses are clear, but do not worry about colouring them.
, while oxide ions have the formula O
. You need to show one magnesium ion and one oxide ion.
. Chloride ions have the formula Cl
You need to show two chloride ions, because two chloride ions are needed to balance the charge on a calcium ion.

574,165,"LEDCs face difficulties as they try to improve the conditions of their citizens. Many solutions have been proposed, with varying degrees of success, but poverty is still a daily reality for millions of people.
Factors that affect the economic gap between MEDCs and LEDCs.
such as the regime in power, relationships with other countries and old colonial ties will influence trading links. The current political regime in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe is a major factor contributing to the low level of development.
such as susceptibility to floods, drought and other hazards can influence development. Frequent drought in the Sahel region of Africa is a huge obstacle in the way of development.
such as wealth generated through industry, agriculture or the availability of natural resources influences development. The UK is one of the world's most developed nations because these factors allowed it to industrialise during the Industrial Revolution.
 many LEDCs are in debt to MEDCs, which means they have to prioritise paying these off with interest before investing in development.

Diabetes  risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
Weighing up the consequences - higher only
Everyone has to make choices about whether to accept the risks associated with some activities. We accept risk every day. Crossing a busy street involves a risk of being knocked over by a car. We accept this risk because we know that this event is very unlikely to happen. But we also know that if it did happen the result could be very serious.
To decide whether we should accept a risk, we need to consider:
what is the chance of the event occurring
what are the consequences to us if the event does occur
With reference to diabetes, each person must make a decision about the diet they eat based on:
the chance of their getting diabetes if they eat poorly or are obese
the consequences of having diabetes in terms of its effect on their lives
Put down that pen and listen to some Science audio.

576,41,"An electronics product can be thought of as a
with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important.
ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM.
Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices.
System diagrams usually take the form of a
in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output.
The block diagrams below shows two types of system.
has no feedback mechanism, so the accuracy depends on how well the system was set up before hand.
electronic systems use sensors to provide feedback. This means that if the output is not satisfactory, the inputs or processes can be altered.

577,1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.
parallel ridges in the earth for growing potatoes
the flattened top edge of the spade blade, against which the digger pushes with his foot
the pole between the handle and the blade
a section of peat, cut from the ground for fuel
In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.
Lines of poetry that make up a unit; verses.
that vary between two lines and five lines in length. There is no pattern to the stanzas, perhaps to reflect the idea that there is no pattern or predictability to our memories.
uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -
Where a phrase or word is repeated several times to emphasise or make a particular point.
(line 16) suggests not only Heaney's affection for his grandfather, but his father's affection for him too: the love between them bonds the three generations.
Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?

. Heaney looks down from his window to see his father digging - and then we find he is looking back twenty years. The pause between the stanzas indicates the gap in time.
The penultimate stanza appeals to our senses. Heaney gives us the cold smell of

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.
.. living roots awaken in my head.
These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Step 1: write down the balanced symbol equation
Sulfuric acid is neutralised by sodium hydroxide, to make sodium sulfate and water, according to the following equation:
Step 2: work out the relative formula mass
The relative formula masses of the reactants and products can be worked out using relative atomic masses obtained from the periodic table.
relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 98
NaOH relative formula mass = 23 + 16 + 1 = 40
relative formula mass = (2 x 23) + 32 + (4 x 16) = 142
O relative formula mass = (2 x 1) + 16 = 18
Step 3: work out the masses of reactants and products
The masses of reactants and products can now be worked out from the equation:
98 + (2x40) = 142 + (2x18)
98 + 80 = 142 + 36
These numbers can now be applied to
- grams, kilograms, tonnes, and so on. Now try the questions below.
What mass of sulfuric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce 10g of sodium sulfate?
is made from 10 x (98  142) = 6.9g of H
What mass of sodium sulfate is made when 5.0 tonnes of sodium hydroxide is reacted with sulfuric acid?
80 tonnes of NaOH is used to make 142 tonnes of Na
5.0 tonnes of NaOH is used to make 5 x (142  80) = 8.875 tonnes of Na

580,2963,"Moving cars have kinetic energy, which is changed into heat energy when they brake. Safety features in modern cars, such as seat belts and crumple zones, are designed to absorb kinetic energy in a crash.
Active safety features include the anti-lock braking system and safety cage. Passive safety features include electric windows and adjustable seats.
Moving cars have kinetic energy. As energy cannot be created or destroyed, when a car
its kinetic energy changes into heat energy. The brakes heat up and then transfer the energy to the surroundings. Modern cars also have
All these features reduce injuries to the people in the car by absorbing energy when they change shape.

581,2503,"If tourism is to be sustainable then the impacts on local people, the economy and the environment need to be balanced. To achieve this there needs to be cooperation between different interest groups. In The Lake District, this includes:
The National Trust (who own a proportion of the land).
Possible strategies to achieve sustainable tourism could be:
Restricting the number of cars and visitors  although this would have an impact on income from tourism.
Fundraising to repair damage done to the natural environment and footpaths  but who should pay?
Education of local people and tourists about sustainable tourism  but who will pay for this?
Underpinning any sustainable strategy is the successful involvement of the local people. With their cooperation, positive outcomes are far more likely.

582,2967,"Like many female characters in the story, Justine is an orphan who cares for other people before herself.
She is brought up in the Frankenstein family home, and acts as their servant.
She is especially fond of Victor's youngest brother, William, and feels responsible when he is murdered by the Monster.
Justine is very beautiful. This beauty angers the Monster when it finds her sleeping, as it knows it will never be allowed to love anyone so attractive. The Monster then places the locket around her neck, knowing it will lead to her being put on trial for the murder.
She is bullied into confessing by a priest. Her calmness and virtue are emphasised and contrasted with the immorality of those who should know better - like Victor, the priest and the judge.

588,1388,"How does the language of the poem work to convey the poet's meaning? Hopkins wanted to make the language work overtime, and used every aspect of it - grammar, dialect, word coinage or combination,
The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.
Vivid 'word pictures' used by a writer to conjure up a mental image of something.
- to make the reader 'feel' the poet's experience.
Gerard Manley Hopkins is famous for playing with language. He invented new words and gave known words new meanings. Some of the compound words in this poem cannot be found in a dictionary, but make sense as you read, like
are combinations of other words, created by Hopkins to give exactly the right meaning to his poem. Words like
contain hidden historical meanings which - when you know them - add to the work the words can do.
. These give the language the rugged, earthy feel of
speech. Think how different the poem would sound if he had used

A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
. Having focused on the burn in great detail, Hopkins now asks us to consider areas of wet and wilderness in general. His question is rhetorical - he is not expecting us to answer - but by asking us to consider what the world would be like without such places, he wants to open our eyes to the wild beauty of the world. He pleads for the beauty to be allowed to remain, with the unspoken idea that the world would be far less marvellous without it.

589,1135,"These are the steps in selective breeding:
from parents to breed the next generation
wheat by crossbreeding wheat plants with disease resistance and wheat plants with a high yield.
by selecting bulls from high yield herds and breeding them with cows that have the best milk production.
Selective breeding can also be used to modify other characteristics of cattle.
Aberdeen Angus bull - bred for beef
Problems with selective breeding - higher tier
Future generations of selectively bred organisms will all share very
more dangerous as all the organisms would be affected. Also there's increased risk of genetic disease caused by

598,3552,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the tone of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
Angrily, to show the poet's attitude to the fact that nothing has changed?
Or in a resigned way, as if he knows that it's almost too much to hope that things can change?
Select a short quotation to justify your choice.
Tatamkhulu Afrika wrote this about his poem:
Nothing's Changed is entirely autobiographical. I can't quite remember when I wrote this, but I think it must have been about 1990. District Six was a complete waste by then, and I hadn't been passing through it for a long time. But nothing has changed. Not only District Six... I mean, we may have a new constitution, we may have on the face of it a beautiful democracy, but the racism in this country is absolutely redolent. We try to pretend to the world that it does not exist, but it most certainly does, all day long, every day, shocking and saddening and terrible.
Look, I don't want to sound like a prophet of doom, because I don't feel like that at all. I am full of hope. But I won't see it in my lifetime. It's going to take a long time. I mean, in America it's taken all this time and it's still not gone... So it will change. But not quickly, not quickly at all.

599,1200,"Michle Roberts had a troubled relationship with her mother, a major theme of
, it is useful to know something about the author and what may have inspired her story.
Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.
