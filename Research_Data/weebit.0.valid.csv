3637,"The February Revolution of 1917 brought the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty to an end. What caused the uprising?
There are three main theories as to why:
was old-fashioned and weak - it collapsed because it was unsuitable.
- its huge problems and disasters overturned a monarchy that had, so far, managed to survive.
- his decisions and actions cost him his throne.
Writing for an academic website, the historian Philip Mosley suggested:
The immediate cause of the February Revolution of 1917 was the collapse of the Tsarist regime under the gigantic strain of World War I. The underlying cause was the backward economic condition of the country, which made it unable to sustain the war effort against powerful, industrialized Germany.
Philip E Mosley, late Professor of International Relations, Columbia University
Notice how he doesn't choose one of the three factors as being the cause of the Revolution. Instead, he suggests that the revolution was caused by a
of all three factors working together - the underlying weaknesses of the government meant that, when he was faced by problems during the First World War, the tsar could not cope with them and fell from power. You may wish to take this as your overview conclusion of the causes of the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia.

7403,"Despite efforts to 'turn metric', it is obvious that there are still many imperial units in use today. For example do you know your height in
? It is therefore helpful to know how to convert between the two.
Converting from one metric unit to another
Perhaps the most common metric conversions are between mm, cm, m and km.
1 m = 100 cm = 1000 mm
1 km = 1000 m = 100 000 cm = 1 000 000 mm
, so 1 km = 1000 m
Once you are confident with conversions between mm, cm, m and km, converting units of mass and capacity is eaier.
1 km = 1000 m, so 1 kg = 1000 g
1 m = 100 cm, so 1 l (litre) = 100 cl (centilitres)
1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 g = 1000 mg (milligrams)
A packet of biscuits weighs 150 g. Find the weight of 12 packets of biscuits:
12  150 = 1800, so 12 packets of biscuits weigh 1800g.
Remember that 1 kg = 1000 g. To convert from g to kg, we divide by 1000.
Here are some examples of metric and imperial measures of length, mass and capacity:
You will be expected to know some common conversions between metric and imperial units. Some of these are shown below, but check with your teacher which ones you need to learn.
A cup has a circumference of 10 inches. What is it in cm?
We are converting from inches to cm, so we
It is easy to get confused over whether to multiply or divide, so here is a way to check your answers:
After doing the conversion, always think about whether your answer should be bigger or smaller than the original number.
In this question, which involves converting inches into cms, we know that cms are smaller than inches, so you should end up with a bigger number than the one you started with. You therefore need to
Use this method to say which of the following conversions are definitely
Remember cm are smaller than feet, so 61 cm = 1860.5 feet must be wrong.
And pounds are smaller than kg, so 14lb = 30.8 kg must be wrong too.

4461,"involves joining separate pieces of material by cutting joints or by using other
The different elements that make up a system or device.
, such as screws, nails and adhesives, or by using heat processes such as
joining two metal objects by melting a softer metal with a lower melting point between them - thus fusing the two surfaces or edges together. Soldering is a form of brazing
joining metals by melting and fusing the adjoining edges or surfaces
. Fabrication processes can be either permanent or temporary. Temporary fabrications are designed to be easily taken apart.
Fabrication processes and when they might be used
Wide range of different joints, used in conjunction with suitable adhesives
Usually only simple butt joints used, joined by welding or soldering
Usually only simple butt joints used, joined by glues or heat gun
Use nails if appearance is not important. Use panel pins for fixing thin plywood and
Medium-density fibreboard - a type of engineered wood made of compressed wood and fibre particles held together with glue
Machine screws, self-tapping screws and nuts and bolts often used
Machine screws, self-tapping screws and nuts and bolts can be used
joining two metal objects by melting a third metal with a lower melting point between them - fusing the two surfaces or edges together. Originally used brass as the 'filler metal'
Some plastics can be welded using a heat gun which melts the plastic together
type of rivet which uses a special tool to expand the rivet on both sides of the material being joined
Rivets can be used to join plastics, but not usually used
Usually used with wood joints, but not always
Some limited use, more in industry than in schools
Plastics often joined with adhesives which melt and fuse the material

such as initial design, breadboard and PCB phases, and at the manufacturing stage. And you need to be familiar with the ways that
[an error occurred while processing this directive]
is used in the electronics design process.
A design procedure is a series of steps which guide you through any electronic design-and-make process. Sticking to the procedure will help deliver a first-class product.
Write down in a few words the purpose of the project
Use graphics, computer software and other techniques to generate design ideas
Select the best design for further development
Once you have defined the purpose of your project, there are two important documents you need to write. These are:
- a short statement of the problem to be solved. The brief should outline the design problem you are tackling, perhaps including one or two of the envisaged design features. Next comes
. This is a longer decument, including full details of the functional and design features of the finished electronic product - as well as information on weight and size, maintenance, cost and safety.
The specification for an electronic product should include electronic factors such as component details, maximum working voltages, maximum currents, and temperature or frequency ranges.
The factors which make a product efficient, safe and comfortable to use are called
. Considerations of style - the things which make a product look and feel good - are called
. You need to consider both ergonomic and aesthetic factors when planning your designs.
When designing circuits, for example, ensure that switches and other control components are placed so that they can be easily reached, and that output components such as LEDs can be easily seen.
A product's style is a more subjective matter, as different people may have different ideas of what looks good. Think about contemporary style, about what is currently fashionable, when designing your product. You may not want to follow the fashion - but you still need to know what it is!
Circuits can be modelled to make sure they work the way you want them to. Circuit modelling can be done either using a computer modelling application, or on a prototype board - also called a
- a board covered with small sockets into which components can be plugged and connected up.
The graphic shows a breadboard with holes connected in two long rows at the top and bottom, and columns of five linked holes elsewhere. Electronic components and wires can be simply plugged into the board in order to make any required circuit connections. The top and bottom rows act as power supply channels for the circuit.
breadboard, showing pattern of holes and connections for prototyping circuits
A breadboard prototype for a 555 monostable timer circuit might look like this:
breadboard showing a 555 timer circuit layout
Once it has been established that the circuit functions as intended, the next step is usually to make a printed circuit board.
PCB showing copper connections running beneath the board
The first step is to draw the circuit on to a
. This is a kind of filter which protects the 'positive' parts of the diagram (the connections between components) and exposes the 'negative' parts (all the rest). The mask is then placed on the board which has a thin coating of copper, and the circuit diagram transferred onto the board using an etch-resist pen. (An alternative technique uses a photosensitive board which is covered by the mask and then exposed to light.) The circuit is then etched onto the board using
in an etching tank; this removes all the unwanted copper, leaving the req uired tracks and pads in place on the board.
NB - this should only be done under a teacher's supervision.
Next, a small PCB drill is used to drill out the center of the pads. Finally the components are pushed through the board and soldered in place.

for a 555 monostable timer circuit, ready for transferring to a board. Note that masks are normally shown from the
side - that is, as though the board was transparent and viewed from the side from which the components are pushed through.
With the components installed, the board would look like this:
In electronics the main method of joining circuits is soldering. Electrical solder is made from an alloy of 65 percent tin and 35 percent lead. It also has a flux running through its core. The flux is needed to ensure that the solder makes a good joint between the components and the tracks and wires on the PCB.
Evaluation and testing is about making sure that the product stays on track with the design
a statement that tells the designer exactly what the product has to do and what the design requirements are.
. You should plan to evaluate and test your project at a number of key stages of design and manufacture. These stages are referred to as
The critical control points for evaluation and testing an electronic product are:
phase. Check that you have used the correct value components, and that the various systems work together. These checks can be done using a computer-simulation package.
a prototype circuit made from a plastic board with holes in which the components are inserted, linked by conductor traces on the underside. Also called a veroboard.
to check whether the circuit works properly. Test each part of the circuit using a
layout. Check that the components are in the correct positions and that you have used the optimum track layout. Make sure that components are located neatly and that joints are well-soldered.
phase. After manufacture, check that the product conforms to its specification. During packaging, check that the product fits securely in the package, and that any conducting parts are insulated.
phase. Look back over the design and making process. Analyse how well it went, noting down any modifications and improvements you would make if you were to do it again. These notes are an important part of your design portfolio.
Make a note of each stage in your design process. If possible, illustrate your notes with digital photographs and/or graphics. Here are some of the things you should include in your notes:
The source of your design ideas and how you adapted these ideas into the intended product.
Your design developments. These should include the circuit designs with annotated notes, circuit diagrams, any computer program simulation work, evidence of bread boarding and testing and the design of your packaging etc.
There are many advantages to using computers in electronics design. They speed up the design process, enabling changes to be made very quickly. They enable circuits and products to be modelled before manufacture. And they make it easy and cheap to store and edit design specifications, and then download them onto machines for manufacturing.
Computer software specially written to facilitate product design is called

use of digital drawings based on geometric shapes, used for solid objects such as car components.
to show how products will look when finished. Different colours and textures can be added to the model and the product can be rotated to show different views.

You may wear a mask in your drama for a variety of reasons. You might want to hide your character's identity, or to portray a fantasy creature. On the other hand, a mask may just be an everyday part of your character's outfit (eg a surgeon's mask).

, whether you're a boy or a girl! Heavy foundation is useful for preventing the skin from looking washed-out under the lights, and face powder helps keep shine to a minimum. You may also want to use eyeliner to define the eyes.
White face powder was popular in the 16th-18th centuries, partly to cover up bad skin caused by lack of washing.
Today, a lot of women (and some men) wear make-up every day, but it's often quite discreet. If your drama is set in modern times, it's unlikely you'll want to go over the top with make-up. Think about your character and their personality before you decide how heavily you want to apply it.
Some people wear a certain type of make-up to reflect a popular movement (eg gothic style make-up) or profession (eg a Japanese geisha girl).
Make-up can also be used to create the look of an injury or bruise, or to create a horror effect.
Make-up to create the look of a bruise
Make-up to create the look of a deep cut

of an immense number of other stars.
The solar system consists of planets, dwarf planets, asteroids and comets in orbit around the Sun. The orbits of the planets are almost circular, but the orbits of comets are ellipses - very squashed circles. Asteroids sometimes hit the Earth and this could have serious consequences.
Galaxies contain billions of stars, and the distances involved are huge. The universe contains at least one billion galaxies.
The conditions in space are hostile to life and spacecraft must be designed to protect their occupants. Space probes can explore other planets without needing astronauts. Scientists are using different methods to see if there is life on planets other than the Earth.

There are eight planets, including the Earth, and smaller dwarf planets, such as Pluto, Ceres and Eris.
The Solar System showing from left to right from the Sun - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto
The Sun's gravity keeps the planets, dwarf planets, comets and asteroids in orbit. The gravity of a planet keeps its satellites in orbit.
The planets take different amounts of time to go around the Sun. A single orbit is called the planet's year, and the further out a planet is the longer its year takes.
The orbits of the planets in the solar system are almost circular  with the Sun near the centre. Many diagrams - including these here - show the orbits very squashed from top to bottom. This is to give a sense of perspective or to fit the diagram to a page in a book.

of the early nineteenth century was very different from today's.
Jane Austen was born on 16 December 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire. The daughter of a clergyman, she was the seventh of eight children. Her formal education ended when she was just 11 years old, but her father, rather like Mr Bennet in
, had a good library and Jane used it well.
Even as a teenager, her writing was lively and humorous. Although
was published in 1813, she'd written an earlier version many years before - it was refused by a London publisher in 1797.
While Austen wrote a great deal about marriage, she never married or had children herself, although she used to love spending time with her many nieces and nephews.
The wedding of Mr Darcy and Elizabeth
is one of the most famous in English literature: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."" This is typical Austen, who makes thought-provoking statements tinged with humour.
In the story, Mrs Bennet is determined to see her five daughters married off. The more 'respectable' the match, the better. She despises Wickham when he runs off with Lydia, but as soon as she finds out he's marrying her, her opinion changes completely. She even remarks that it's a great achievement, as Lydia is only 16. Mrs Bennet hates Darcy - until he proposes to Elizabeth.
Miss Bingley is deliberately rude to Elizabeth because she fears (rightly) that Darcy will marry her. Lady Catherine de Bourgh is horrible to Elizabeth for the same reason. Miss Bingley even lies to Jane about her brother being engaged to someone else, as she feels the marriage would reflect badly on her family.
Mr Bennet realised many years before that his wife was completely unsuited to him, but the question of divorce would never have been raised. It was almost unheard of and would have brought shame on the family.
At the time, marriage was seen as a social contract, often without the need for love. Lady Catherine had planned for her daughter to marry Darcy for many years, despite their
. And Charlotte Lucas marries Mr Collins simply because he can provide her with financial security. She doesn't love him, or even respect him.
By contrast, the couplings of Jane and Bingley and Elizabeth and Darcy are sincere and heart-warming.
Mr Bingley and Jane Bennet on their wedding day
Class - your social rank - was a dominating factor for those living in Austen's world. Your class often determined how you were regarded by others - and how you might treat people yourself. It was considered unusual, even improper, to marry someone far removed from your own class.
At the top of the tree were the aristocracy. Put simply, these people were royalty or relatives (sometimes distant) of royalty. Lady Catherine might very well qualify as aristocracy. If not, she's certainly '
' who've had wealth and property for generations. This changed in the 18th century because of the Industrial Revolution. '
' were people who hadn't inherited wealth but made a lot of money from business.
Bingley is new gentry, because his father made his money in industry somewhere in northern England. Bingley's sisters don't brag about this because 'new gentry' isn't as high up the class ladder as 'old gentry'.
The Bennets are much further down the social scale. They're considerably better off than many, but a world away from Darcy - not just because he's far richer, but they lack 'breeding'. Darcy comes from generations of wealth and 'respect'. It's much less of a social jump for Bingley to marry Jane than for Darcy to marry Elizabeth. When Lady Catherine gets angry at Elizabeth, she describes her as ""a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world"".
Darcy eventually sees beyond the class difference. However, even he admits he struggled against his feelings for a long time because of the
'Manners', or how you chose to interact with other people, were incredibly important in Austen's time. Even if people were in a state of high emotion, they had to maintain an air of dignity at all times.
Some of the funniest passages in the book are when characters are arguing. These weren't intended to be funny in Austen's time. Rather, the rules of 'manners' meant people had to be very careful about what they could say, and had to get their point across with clever language.
Mrs Bennet believes she has good manners. However, she's so stupid she fails to see that she often embarrasses herself by acting improperly. She is too loud, too bold, and says things that are too direct. Lydia is a younger version of her. This was a real character flaw in Austen's time.
Ironically, the person with the worst manners is the one who, due to 'breeding', should have the most impeccable: Lady Catherine. She's almost always rude, and downright insulting to Elizabeth. Due to her upper class status, she feels justified in being ill-mannered because everyone is 'below' her.

The poem is a true story, or ""as true as I and my memory can make it"". (Clarke was a young girl when the main event happened, perhaps the same age as the child in the poem.) It is about a girl who nearly drowned in a lake and was given the kiss of life by Clarke's mother. When the child was taken back to her
This frightening memory leads the poet to question the ability of our memories to retell the truth - she wonders about other influences that could cloud the precision of our memories.

Pairs of lines of poetry that rhyme and have the same length and metric pattern.
Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.
The poem is written in the past

, dealing with events in Clarke's memory. Certain details, those that made a big impression on her, such as the appearance of the girl when she was pulled from the water
(line 3) are described in detail, while other aspects are left vague. What effect does this give? What does it suggest about memory?
Apart from the poet's family, the characters are

The first stanza initially makes us believe that the child is already dead,

The person given the most vivid description is of Clarke's mother, since this is the scene that Clarke remembers most clearly. She was the

Just when we have been led to believe we are reading a 'happy ever after' story of rescue, we are told the girl was taken home and
(line 14). We are not told specifically why she was beaten - perhaps her parents were angry with her for the trouble she had caused, or found that hitting her was a way of venting the anxiety they had when they realised she was missing. Either way, the beating troubled Clarke so much that she wonders whether it actually happened -
There are a number of overtones of a fairy story in the poem - a miraculous rescue, a heroine, a poor family. Clarke explores this idea even further in

4, where she wonders about memory and what affects it. She says, ""When you recapture a memory from early childhood, you're sometimes not sure if you were really there, if someone told you about it, or if you read it in a story. I'd read fairy stories and legends about people drowning in mysterious lakes. I'd seen a famous painting of a drowned girl floating in a brook ..""
""All lost things lie under closing water""
(line 21) - we wonder what type of things Clarke means. She is presumably not talking about objects. Is she referring to lost memories? Missed chances? Regrets? What do you think? Of course, the

The fourth stanza contains one very long, sprawling sentence, broken over several line-ends: it's hard to grasp exactly what is being said, beyond the impressions of shadowy willows, murky water, and low-flying swans. This lends an obscure, dream-like feeling to the description.
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the

A good way to decide on the
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. How would you read this poem?
in a matter-of-fact, straightforward tone, reporting an event?
in a wistful tone, as if dwelling on the many years that have passed between the events described and the present, and other lost things?
in a matter-of-fact tone, as if simply recounting what happened.
in a dreamy, romantic tone, as if telling a fairy story?
In fact you might use all three of these tones of voice, at least in part. The first two lines are straightforward reporting, so matter of fact would be fine here. From then on, however the poem veers away from this tone, becoming dreamy, wistful, romantic - almost mystical. So the other two tones of voice would be more appropriate here.
This poem seems to be about the nature of memory, especially of child-hood memories. The speaker's recollection of the event is apparently quite clear at the start of the poem - yet it gradually becomes clear that she is not really sure whether all of it really happened, and the description gradually comes to seem more and more suggestive of a fairy tale or dream.
Look at these quotations, and our suggestions about how to 'read' them.
.. a heroine, her red head bowed .. my mother ..
Clarke's mother is a heroine in both senses. She saves a child's life through her prompt action; but she is also - working her miracle of resuscitation - like fairy-story heroine of saintly goodness and magical powers.
My father took her home to a poor house ..
Clarke seems to sympathise with the girl and her family for their poverty. Poor is used twice (lines 13 and 22); it reminds us of fairy tales where the heroine is poor, like Rumplestilkskin. Being poor of course does not excuse the thrashing inflicted on the child for almost drowning!
Although Clarke has narrated the events in some detail, she then checks herself - 'Was I there?' The events seem very real to her but she is aware that her memory could have been influenced by other things she'd seen and heard of.
.. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness / after the treading, heavy webs of swans ..
By the fourth stanza, the memory has become as murky and misty as the cloudy blooms of mud in the lake. Then there are the swans - another magical ingredient, since young maidens often turn into swans in fairy stories!
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems explore the more dangerous aspects of water, Clarke focusing on its power to suck us in and drown us, Heaney on its potential for violent destructiveness during a storm. Clarke's poem uses the lake to symbolise the shifting quality of memory, while Heaney's poem is more purely descriptive.
Again, both poems deal with the threatening aspects of water; both from the writer's personal experience. And both poems contain a hint of the supernatural - Clarke using fairy story references, Whitman using more religious

Both poems contain descriptions of water, but for Clare the water is beautiful and clear with none of the threat or murkiness of Clarke's lake. Is this difference reflected in the differing structures of the poems - the regular form and

The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other.
The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas and attitudes and tone.
Compare Cold Knap Lake with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that involve water. What is each poet's attitude to the water they describe?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Seamus Heaney's Storm on the Island, Walt Whitman's Patrolling Barnegat, and John Clare's Sonnet.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Cold Knap Lake with each of these three poems.
Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

5477,"The multiples of a number are all the numbers that it will divide into. This includes the number itself.
For example, the multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
The multiples of 20 are 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
Look at the lists - multiples are just like times tables.

Although every LEDC city has its own characteristics, models can be used to illustrate a 'typical' LEDC city.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
- often the oldest part of the city.
In LEDCs the poorest housing is found on the edge of the city - in contrast to MEDC cities whose suburban fringe is very often a place of high quality housing. The areas of poor quality housing found on the edge of cities in LEDCs are called
The below pictures show two very different areas of Sao Paulo in Brazil - the CBD and an outerlying shanty town.
The CBD in an LEDC looks very similar to a CBD in an MEDC. However, there is likely to be a more dramatic difference between the height of the buildings in the CBD and the height of the buildings in other zones.
The CBD contains facilities such as department stores, hotels, offices, schools, theatres and cinemas.
High-class housing can be found around the edge of the CBD and in a spine radiating out towards the edge of the urban area. This is likely to be a main transport route and a desirable street, possibly a former colonial area. People living here will need easy access to the CBD. Transport networks in LEDCs are not as well developed as MEDCs so the journey to work is a major consideration when deciding where to live.
The high class housing will be a mixture of old colonial houses and large apartments, both of which will have space for servants.
The fact that cities in LEDCs are growing rapidly means that conditions can be poor. There are often great inequalities within LEDC urban areas and they are even more pronounced in LEDCs.
Some of the worst conditions are found in the shanty towns on the edge of the city, near the CBD or along main transport routes. They tend to be unplanned and are often illegal. Houses are self-built using basic materials and shanty towns have few services.
Shanty town residents face many problems on a daily basis.
is a shanty town located near the city of Cape Town. Shanty towns are also known as
in South Africa. Khyalitsha has a population of over 1.8 million people and is one of the largest townships in South Africa.
The Alexandra township in Johannesburg, South Africa
- the settlement has a high population density.
- the area does not have enough resources to support the growing population.
- poor sanitation and limited health care can lead to the spread of disease.
- the newest and poorest arrivals may be forced to live on the worst quality land.
- services are poor, public transport is limited and connections to the electricity supply can be limited and sometimes dangerous.
Over time the conditions in shanty towns may improve. In many LEDCs, local communities, charities and government departments are working together to improve conditions in squatter settlements.
Improving conditions in a squatter settlements can lead to improvements in the residents'
The level of well-being and enjoyment of life that people have.
These give people the chance to rent or buy a piece of land. The land is connected to the city by transport links and has access to essential services (eg water). People build their own homes using money from a low-interest loan.
These give people the tools and training to improve their homes. Low-interest loans may be used to help people fund these changes. People may be given legal ownership of the land.
Improving the quality of life and creating greater opportunities in rural areas may prevent people from migrating to urban areas. Investment in rural areas may therefore help to improve conditions in the city as well.

6989,"Gears consist of toothed wheels fixed to shafts. The teeth interlock with each other, and as the first shaft (the
) rotates, the motion is transmitted to the second or
. The motion output at the driven shaft will be different from the motion input at the driver shaft - in place, speed, direction and other ways.
A number of gears connected together are called a
. The input (eg a motor) is connected to the driver gear. The output, (eg the wheel of a buggy) is connected to the driven gear.
The photograph below shows a simple gear train made up of a couple of spur gears. These are the common gears (or cogs) that look like wheels with teeth around the rim. Next to the photo is a diagram showing how you would draw this gear train in an exam.
In the drawing, the centre of each gear is shown by a cross. Each gear is drawn as two circles, one slightly larger than the other to show where the teeth would be. Teeth do not have to be drawn, but the number of teeth is written next to the gear, in this case 60 teeth and 15 teeth. Arrows indicate the direction that the gears are moving. Note that with two connected gears, they will be rotating in opposite directions.
Where there are two gears of different sizes, the smaller gear will rotate faster than the larger gear. The difference between these two speeds is called the
, and can be calculated using the number of teeth. The formula is:
Gear ratio = number or teeth on driven gear  number of teeth on the driver gear
So the gear ratio for the simple gear train above, if the smaller gear is the driver gear, is:
Gear ratio = 60  15 = 4
In other words, the driver gear revolves four times to make the driven gear revolve once.
If you know the gear ratio, and the speed input at the driver gear, you can calculate the speed output at the driven gear using the formula:
Output speed = input speed  gear ratio
So if the gear ratio is 4 and the driver gear is revolving at 200
= revolutions per minute, a measure of speed of rotation
output speed = 200  4 = 50 rpm

925,"The island plays an important part in the novel. We see it first as a paradise - it is a place of 'enchantment', where 'flower and fruit grew together on the same tree.' Yet it is also full of dangers.
The table lists some of the things the boys find on their island, with descriptions that suggest either an island paradise - or something more frightening or sinister.

""The white surf flicked the coral reef.""
""...the long, grinding roar of the breakers on the beach ""

5413,"Ions are electrically charged particles formed when
An atom is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that element, comprising electrons surrounding a nucleus of protons and neutrons.
Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons.
. They have the same electronic structures as noble gases.
Metal atoms form positive ions, while non-metal atoms form negative ions. The strong
An electrostatic force is generated by differences in electric charge (ie positive and negative) between two particles. It can also refer to electricity at rest.
forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions are called ionic bonds.
An ionic compound occurs when a negative ion (an atom that has gained an electron) joins with a positive ion (an atom that has lost an electron). The ions swap electrons to achieve a full outer shell.
Ions are electrically charged particles formed when atoms lose or gain
Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons.
. This loss or gain leaves a complete highest energy level, so the electronic structure of an ion is the same as that of a noble gas - such as a helium, neon or argon.
Metal atoms and non-metal atoms go in opposite directions when they ionise:
lose the electron, or electrons, in their highest energy level and
gain an electron, or electrons, from another atom to
There is a quick way to work out what the charge on an ion should be:
the number of charges on an ion formed by a
the number of charges on an ion formed by a
equal to the group number minus eight
: carbon and silicon in Group 4 usually form
A covalent bond between atoms forms when atoms share electrons to achieve a full outer shell of electrons.
: the elements in Group 0 do not react with other elements to form ions.

4993,"When scientific data has been collected, it is important that this data and any conclusions are reviewed by other scientists. This is called 'peer review'.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to:
Describe the peer review process. For instance, state that other scientists repeat the experiment to see if they get similar results and conclusions.
Understand that new scientific claims are less reliable if they have not yet been evaluated by peer review. For example, remarkable claims are being made for 'superfoods', such as that they prevent heart disease and increase longevity. However, many of the claims have not yet been peer reviewed, so they should not be treated as totally reliable.
Understand that if the results of an investigation have not been replicated by other scientists, they should be treated with suspicion.
Using the example of how lifestyle factors can affect the risk of heart disease, you need to be able to explain why scientists think it is important that a claim by one scientist should be replicated by other scientists. This is because the first set of results may contain errors. When scientific research is being paid for by a company with a vested interest, such a food company producing a food that is claimed to lower cholesterol, the results that support the claim need to be examined and replicated to make sure that they are correct.

Chemicals used in aerosol spray cans and fridges, when released into the atmosphere, gradually made their way up to the ozone layer, and removed some of it. This has increased the intensity of the
Electromagnetic radiation with a frequency between that of visible light and X-rays.
reaching the Earth. These chemicals are not used any more, and the ozone layer is gradually returning to normal. However, this will take a few years.
It is important to be able to assess the size of risk in any activity. No activity is completely safe.
The consequence of too much ultraviolet  skin cancer  often does not appear until much later in life, so it doesn't seem a real risk to young people.
It is difficult to assess how much ultraviolet you are receiving when you are sunbathing. If you feel hot, that is because of the infrared, not the ultraviolet.
Weather forecasts now inform you of the intensity of ultraviolet radiation. See for example
For most risky activities, there are benefits as well as risks:
sunbathing produces a sun tan, which many people find more attractive
some ultraviolet is good for you, as it produces vitamin D in the skin

3 - As a student, taking the coach is ideal when I travel. There are always special prices available for young people with a travel card.
4 - I know that it pollutes, but for a weekend break abroad, the plane is the perfect answer. It's cheaper than before, and it's so much quicker.
5 - I love skating! To go to college on my rollerblades only takes five minutes. As there are no traffic jams, I even get there before the teachers!
6 - For business trips, the train is really good. It's comfortable, and I can eat and work whilst travelling. I don't waste any time.
7 - I'm very sporty, so I try to go everywhere on my bike. It's good for my health, and I don't contribute to pollution!
8 - Taking the bus isn't at all expensive when you buy the tickets in advance. It only costs me 1 euro 50 a day to go to work.

558,"One thing that you must be able to do in order to get higher grades in your Spanish writing exam is to start sentences and link short sentences in a variety of ways. This exercise suggests some different ways of doing this, pointing out what you should include if you were answering a typical exam question about places of interest.
You are asked to write an article about a visit to Puerto de la Cruz in the Canary Islands. You are given some notes and a map to help you. To get really good marks, you need to be able to write longer sentences with varied constructions. See the answers for good examples of this.
Pasaste las vacaciones en Puerto de la Cruz, en las islas Canarias (donde se habla espaol). Ahora tu profesor de espaol quiere que escribas un artculo describiendo tus experiencias. Puedes mencionar:

different points. Aim to write about 15-20 words for each.
Remember, you don't need to refer to everything you see on the map.
You may want to read the examiner's advice before revealing the answer and comparing it to that of your own.
The numbers for the questions and answers correspond.

Think about what you might write in your first sentence.
pasaste las vacaciones en Puerto de la Cruz en las Islas Canarias
You are given a useful link word,
Look on the map to find somewhere you might have stayed.
Don't forget to adapt the verb correctly. Who are you referring to?
Give your opinion or say something else about the place you stayed (imagine what it might have been like).
Think about using donde and que to link your sentences here.
You are given a useful link word,
Use the map to give you an idea of how big the town is and what sort of buildings and amenities there are.
Remember you are being asked for your own opinion.
Use the map to help you here.
Use preterite tense for what you did and present for things that are still there.
You won't get top marks for repeating the same verb or just putting a list of buildings.
Try to include other verbs in your list.
You are now being asked what you did, not where you went.
If you don't know what it was like, guess.
A good opportunity to use some expressions of time.
un incidente o accidente que te pas
Decide whether it was an incident or an accident.
Think of something you know how to say.
Which tenses? Pluperfect to set the scene. Imperfect for what was going on. Preterite for what happened.
Preterites of reflexive verbs caerse, torcerse - remember pronoun position (
Why not use the last section to sum up and give your opinion?
An impressive way to finish would be to use
Try to vary what you write as much as possible by using different verbs, tenses and persons.
When you are given a very full piece of source material (eg a map), you will not be expected to refer to everything on it.
If you don't know how to say something, leave it out, as you will only lose marks if it is wrong. Put something else you do know how to say instead.
Try to link sentences in an interesting and varied way.

2060,"A large-scale ecosystem that can be categorised into one of nine major types. The type of biome is defined mainly by its climate.
is located further away from the equator than the tropical rainforest biome in the central part of Africa and in South America. It is dry, but not as dry as desert areas.
To see a map of where savannah grasslands are located in the world,
Savannahs - also known as tropical grasslands - are found to the north and south of tropical rainforest biomes. The largest expanses of savannah are in Africa, where much of the central part of the continent, for example
, consists of tropical grassland. Savannah grasslands can also be found in
Savannah regions have two distinct seasons - a wet season and a dry season. There is very little rain in the dry season. In the wet season vegetation grows, including lush green grasses and wooded areas. As you move further away from the equator and its heavy rainfall, the grassland becomes drier and drier - particularly in the dry season. Savannah vegetation includes

The graph below shows average monthly temperatures and rainfall levels in the savannah region of Mali. Notice how the temperature and rainfall patterns relate to each other - the hottest temperatures come just before heavy rainfall, and the coolest time of the year comes just after the rains. This pattern is typical of savannah climates.
Savannah grassland soils are not very fertile. The nutrients in the soil are found near the surface as they come from decayed organic matter (vegetation) from the previous growing season. This organic matter decays rapidly due to the high temperatures.
Soils tend to be red in colour due to their high iron content. The diagram below shows the different horizons, or layers, of soil in savannah grassland. Plant roots cannot penetrate the hard 'pan' layer in the B-horizon, or subsoil. This restricts vegetation growth.
The Serengeti plains of Tanzania are probably the best known African savannah.
There are two main types of vegetation in the Serengeti. Grasses cover the vast open plains of the southeast while in the central region, acacia plants are more common. The Serengeti is rich in wildlife - including giraffes, zebras, elephants, lions and over 2 million wildebeest. Many of the animals found on the Serengeti can be found nowhere else in the world.

Savannah regions have two distinct seasons - a wet season and a dry season. There is very little rain in the dry season. In the wet season vegetation grows, including lush green grasses and wooded areas. As you move further away from the equator and its heavy rainfall, the grassland becomes drier and drier - particularly in the dry season. Savannah vegetation includes

1252,"Space probes are spacecraft that can visit other planets without the need for astronauts. They can send back information about things such as the:
temperature, magnetic field strength and radiation levels
the surroundings, including the composition of any atmosphere.
Some of the missions undertaken by such craft include:
Viking 1 and Viking 2 (landed on Mars in the 1970s, took photographs and analysed soil samples)
Mars Global Surveyor (went into orbit around Mars in 1997 and mapped the surface in 3D)
Spirit and Opportunity (two robot vehicles that landed on Mars in 2004).
Unmanned space probes do not need to carry food, water or oxygen. They can withstand conditions that would be lethal to astronauts.

5975,"Michle Roberts had a troubled relationship with her mother, a major theme of
, it is useful to know something about the author and what may have inspired her story.
Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.

6964,"The Sikh concept of a Just War
is a war fought in the defence of righteousness, similar to the concept of a Just War.
the war must be the last resort - all other ways of resolving the conflict must be tried first
the motive must not be revenge or anger
only the minimum force needed for success should be used
there must be no looting, territory must not be taken, property taken must be returned
all treaties and ceasefires must be honoured
no places of worship (of any faith) should be damaged
soldiers who surrender should not be harmed
and the western Just War theory is that Sikhs believe that a justifiable war should be undertaken even if it cannot be won.

366,"proteins which catalyse or speed up chemical reactions inside our bodies
work best at 37C, so the bodys temperature is controlled. A part of the brain called the
monitors and controls body temperature. It gathers information as nerve impulses from
the brain - these are sensitive to the temperature of the blood flowing there
the skin - these are sensitive to skin temperature
Sweating is one way to help cool the body. We sweat more in hot conditions, so more water is lost from the body. This water must be replaced through food or drink to maintain the balance of water in the body.

657,"Temperatures drop the further an area is from the equator. Due to the curvature of the earth. In areas closer to the poles, sunlight has a larger area of atmosphere to pass through and the sun is at a lower angle in the sky. As a result, more energy is lost and temperatures are cooler.
In addition, the presence of ice and snow nearer the poles causes a higher
Albedo is a measure of how much sunlight a surface reflects.
. This means that more solar energy is reflected, also contributing to the cold.
Locations at a higher altitude have colder temperatures. Temperature usually decreases by 1 C for every 100m in altitude.
Oceans heat up and cool down much more slowly than land. This means that coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than places inland at the same latitude and altitude. Glasgow, for example, is at a similar latitude to Moscow, but is much milder.
. A warm ocean current called the
keeps Britain warmer and wetter than places in continental Europe.
The prevailing wind is the most frequent wind direction a location experiences. In Britain the prevailing wind is from the southwest, which brings warm, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. This contributes to the frequent rainfall. When prevailing winds blow over land areas, it can contribute to creating desert climates.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - Language
If you are given a question about the language in this Key Extract, here is how to use
(see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer:
When talking about language, the things to concentrate on are:
Whether there might be another meaning behind the first most obvious one
The example below is about the language of love. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love.
Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love.
The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle.
At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.

SECTION 1 - Act 1, Scene 2, lines 376 to 505
(Other spirit voices in the air) Bow-wow!
Where should this music be? I'the air or the earth?
It sounds no more; and, sure, it waits upon
Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the King my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it 
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
(Song) Full fathom five thy father lies 
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
(Chorus of spirit voices) Ding dong 
(ARIEL and spirit voices) Ding dong bell.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
(To MIRANDA) The fringd curtains of thine eye advance,
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
No, wench: it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck  and, but hes something stained
With grief (thats beautys canker), thou mightst call him
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
As my soul prompts it. (To ARIEL) Spirit, fine spirit! Ill free thee
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island 
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here. My prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is  O, you wonder! 
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me 
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, neer since at ebb, beheld
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now twere fit to dot. At the first sight
Ill set thee free for this. (To FERDINAND) A word, good sir.
I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word.
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that eer I saw  the first
That eer I sighed for. Pity move my father
(Aside) They are both in eithers powers. But this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. (To FERDINAND) One word more: I charge thee
That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp
The name thou owst not  and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Theres nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell witht.
(To MIRANDA) Speak not you for him; hes a traitor. (To FERDINAND) Come!
Ill manacle thy neck and feet together.
Sea-water shalt thou drink: thy food shall be
The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks
He draws his sword but is prevented from moving by
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
My foot my tutor? (To FERDINAND) Put thy sword up, traitor 
Who makst a show, but darst not strike, thy conscience
Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward 
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
Thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban,
Are then most humble. I have no ambition
Thy nerves are in their infancy again,
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My fathers loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this mans threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid. All corners else othe earth
Let liberty make use of: space enough
(Aside) It works. (To FERDINAND) Come on.
(To ARIEL) Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! (To FERDINAND) Follow me.
(To ARIEL, whispering more instructions) Hark what thou else shalt do me.
My fathers of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted
(To ARIEL) Thou shalt be as free
As mountain winds. But then exactly do
(To FERDINAND) Come, follow. (To MIRANDA) Speak not for him.

166,"> Paragraphs - How paragraphs are set out
Paragraphs - How paragraphs are set out
There are two main ways of setting out paragraphs, with a few small variations:
By putting an indent at the start
The first example shows how new paragraphs can be started on the next available line, but with the first word beginning slightly to the right, or indented.
We've just come back from a lovely holiday in Southsea. The weather was glorious and Albert has still got a deep, golden glow from the sunshine. It's a pity it can't be like that all year round.
The hotel we stayed in was spotless. We felt like royalty because the bedsheets were changed twice, in the same week! I told Albert not to get too used to it as I wasn't going to carry that sort of thing on when we got home. We also got nice, clean fluffy towels every other day too.
The second example shows how new paragraphs can be started by missing a line. In this type of example, indenting the first new word is not necessary.

107,"Relative frequency = number of times the event happens  total number of trials
For example, if you observed 100 passing cars and found that 23 of them were red, the relative frequency is 23/100.
, you learnt that you get a more accurate result in surveys of events if you carry out a large number of trials or survey a large number of people.
A bag contains 3 red sweets and 7 blue sweets.
Tom took a sweet from the bag, noted its colour and then replaced it.
He did this 10 times and found that he obtained a red sweet on 4 occasions (ie the relative frequency was 4/10).
He then carried out the experiment another 10 times, combined his results with the first trial and saw that - in total - he had obtained a red sweet on 5 out of 20 occasions (ie the relative frequency was 5/20 ).
Tom continued in this way, recording his combined results after every 10 trials and showing them on the graph below:
We can see from the graph that relative frequency gets better (ie closer to the true probability) as the number of trials increases.

is who you are writing for. This may be teenagers, adults or even children. It helps to put yourself in your audience's place - so for example, if you are writing a letter informing parents about a school trip, it is likely that parents will want to know about cost, safety and key facts such as times and places. Writing for adults doesn't necessarily mean you have to use long or complicated words - just ensure your writing is clear, sensible and interesting.

for all sorts of questions. The more you practise it, the better you'll get.

Magnets and electric current - Electric bell
. They are found in electric motors and loudspeakers. Very large and powerful electromagnets are used as lifting magnets in scrap yards to pick up, then drop, old cars and other scrap iron and steel.
Electric bells like the ones used in most schools also contain an electromagnet.
When the current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet makes a magnetic field.
The electromagnet attracts the springy metal arm.
The arm hits the gong, which makes a sound.
The circuit is broken now the arm is out of position.
The electromagnet is turned off and the springy metal arm moves back.
The cycle repeats as long as the switch is closed. Check your understanding of this with the animation.

Q1. Work out the value of the following:
a) 4  5 - 3  2
b) (2 + 3)  (5 - 1)
a) In BODMAS multiplication comes before subtraction, so work out the multiplication first and then do the subtraction:
4  5 - 3  2 = 20 - 6 = 14
(2 + 3)  (5 - 1) = 5  4 = 20
c) In BODMAS division comes before addition, so
2 + 6  2 = 2 + 3 = 5
8 - (6 - 1) = 8 - 5 = 3
e) BODMAS states that brackets come before multiplication, so work out the bracket first:
3  (4 + 2) = 3  6 = 18

181,"> Ratio - Division in a given ratio
Ratio - Division in a given ratio
Dave and Lisa win 500 between them. They agree to divide the money in the ratio 2:3.
The ratio 2:3 tells us that for every 2 parts Dave receives, Lisa will receive 3 parts. There are 5 parts in total.
500 represents 5 parts. Therefore, 100 represents 1 part.
Dave receives 2 parts: 2  100 = 200
Lisa receives 3 parts: 3  100 = 300
It's important to notice what order the parts of the ratio are written in. 2:3 is not the same as 3:2.
In the example, the ratio of Dave's money to Lisa's was 2:3. If we swap the order to 3:2 then Dave would get more than Lisa.
To keep it the same as in the example we could say that the ratio of Lisa's money to Dave's would be 3:2
Q1. Amelia and Shabana win a sum of money, which they agree to share in the ratio 5:3.
If Amelia receives 150, how much will Shabana receive?
Q2. A necklace is made using gold and silver beads in the ratio 3:2. If there are 80 beads in the necklace:
A1. Amelia receives 5 parts, which is equivalent to 150. Therefore, 150 represents 5 parts.
Shabana receives 3 parts: 3  30 = 90.
A2. Gold : Silver = 3:2, so there are 5 parts altogether.
80  5 = 16, so 1 part represents 16 beads.
a) Gold = 3  16 = 48 beads
b) Silver = 2  16 = 32 beads

5,"is made from different substances that are
For example powdered iron and powdered sulfur mixed together makes a mixture of iron and sulfur. They can be separated from each other without a chemical reaction, in the way that different coloured sweets can be picked out from a mixed packet and put into separate piles.
Mixtures have different properties from compounds. The table summarises these differences.
Variable composition  you can vary the amount of each substance in a mixture.
Definite composition  you cannot vary the amount of each element in a compound.
The different substances are not chemically joined together.
The different elements are chemically joined together.
Each substance in the mixture keeps its own properties.
The compound has properties different from the elements it contains.
Each substance is easily separated from the mixture.
It can only be separated into its elements using chemical reactions.
Water, carbon dioxide, magnesium oxide, sodium chloride.
An example - iron, sulfur and iron sulfide
Remember that iron and sulfur react together when they are heated to make a compound called iron sulfide. What are the differences between a mixture of iron and sulfur, and iron sulfide? Here are some of them:
The mixture can contain more or less iron, but iron sulfide always contains equal amounts of iron and sulfur.
The iron and sulfur atoms are not joined together in the mixture, but they are joined together in iron sulfide.
The iron and sulfur still behave like iron and sulfur in the mixture, but iron sulfide has different properties from both iron and sulfur.
You can separate the iron from the mixture using a magnet but this does not work for iron sulfide.

143,"> Approximation - Significant figures - decimals
Rounding 12.756 or 4.543 to 1 decimal place (d.p.) seems sensible, as the rounded figures are very close to the actual value.
But what happens if you round a very small number to 1 d.p?
This is not a useful answer. Another way to find an approximate answer with very small numbers is to use
Significant figures start at the first non-zero number, so ignore the zeros at the front, but not the ones in between. Look at the following examples:
From the first significant figure onwards, all zeros are included. It's only the zeros at the beginning that don't count.
How many significant figures do the following numbers have?

325,"> Magnets and electric current - Electrolysis
Electrical energy can cause chemical reactions. This happens in a chemical process called
One use for electrolysis is to break down water (H
Electrolysis of water and sulfuric acid solution
is added to the water to make the process work.
Where the electrodes come into contact with the water chemical changes take place, producing bubbles of gas. Oxygen at one electrode and hydrogen at the other one.
This electrolysis produces twice as much hydrogen as oxygen. They are both useful gases used in many chemical processes in industry.

3,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - 2 unknowns
Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - 2 unknowns
We already know how to solve equations in one unknown, but what happens when there are two unknowns?
more than one value to be found
The two equations cannot be solved on their own. Each one by itself has infinitely many solutions.
For example x + y = 10 has infintely many values for x and y for which this is true, like x=1, y=9
together to make one equation that has only one solution. The x and y values of this solution will solve both of the original equations at the same time. This is why they are called simultaneous equations, because you are trying to solve them both with the same values for x and y.
One way to solve them is using the
tells you that y = 2x, so
this value of y into the second equation.
This gives you the value of x, but what is the value of y?
tells you that y = 2x, so y must be 4.
You can check your answer in the other equation (in this case,
This is right, so the values are correct.
The solution of the equations is therefore
Use the substitution method to solve the following simultaneous equations:
Substitute the value of y from equation (1) into equation (2)
2x + (x + 2) = 11
To find y use this x value in equation (1): y = x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
Check in equation (2): (2  3) + 5 = 11 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 3, y = 5

88,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Inequalities
In an equation the '=' sign means that the two sides are identical. But what happens when the two sides are not identical?
If this is the case you need to use inequalities to show the relationship between the two sides.
For example, if x > 2, then x = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... (x is greater than, but not equal to 2, so don't include the 2).
If y is  4, then y = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, ... (y is less than or equal to 4, so do include the 4).
If z  3, what are the possible values of z?
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...
z is greater than or equal to 3, so it can be 3 and any number greater than 3.

373,"So far, we have identified two types of sentence -
The other main type of sentence that a writer may use is called a
. Compound sentences contain two or more pieces of information and the pieces are linked by connectives. Connectives are words such as:
Here are three examples of compound sentences with the connectives written in bold:
One advantage of compound sentences is that a writer can build more detail into their writing. However, one problem is that some writers can get carried away and write long rambling sentences:
My mate came round and said, ""Do you want to go out?"" and I did so we went to the park and sat around for a bit and then these other girls came over who we knew from school so we started talking to them and then we felt hungry so we...
Did you spot the problem? Remember, care needs to be taken with connectives. Two in a sentence is usually enough, and they don't need to be used in every sentence.
Writers sometimes don't use full sentences. Fragments often help to emphasise a point, create drama or show surprise:
She looked as carefully as she could, but found nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Imagine this. You're trapped. It's dark. It's cold.
Repeating a word or phrase can emphasise a point, or make sure it's fully understood:
His head was drooping as if it weighed a ton, but it was held up by a sharp band around his throat that was almost choking him. He tried to reach up and tear the band away, but there were sharp bands round his wrists as well. He tried to move his feet, but there were more cold, sharp bands around his ankles.
Westall refers to the bands around Ralph's body four times. This isn't because he couldn't think of another phrase. He is emphasising how tightly Ralph is trapped to create a sense of fear and tension. He also allows us to build up a picture gradually, just like Ralph does as he is regaining consciousness. Bit by bit, both Ralph and the reader realise that every part of him is tied up - there is no chance of escape.

Atmosphere and setting - PEE and useful phrases
As well as having lots of ideas, you need to explain them clearly. An effective way of doing this is to PEE. PEE stands for:
Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness?
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
The extract describes a cold, empty landscape.
The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"".
The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"".
This suggests that the place is completely isolated.
The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore.
If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means...
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that...
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Also remember that certain words and phrases are especially helpful when you're explaining an idea in detail. They can be particularly helpful if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following wordbank shows you some of those phrases, and you might be able to add some more:
Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:

Write a description of your school during a typical break. Write about the classrooms, the hall, and outside as well as the pupils and the staff.
There are lots of ways of answering this question - it depends on the type of school you go to and what you notice about it. However, a good answer would probably describe what was happening in different areas. Think what might be happening in each of these places, then click on the button to check your ideas. Remember, the answers are only suggestions - your school might be very different.
One of the Year 7 pupils is near to tears and frantically looking for a bag they've lost. Their maths homework was due in today and they don't want a detention.
The Spanish teacher writing a list of new words on the board ready for a lesson about shopping.
A tired English teacher collecting a set of poetry books and dreading the next lesson with 10C - she's already got some detention slips laid out on her desk.
A boy and girl from Year 11 chatting quietly in the corner of Music - they're usually here each break but shouldn't be inside really.
Three Year 9 boys writing on one of the tables in History - they should definitely not be in the room.
Groups from Year 7 playing games, like kicking a ball around or chasing after each other.
Three girls from Year 8 arguing about a song.
Two boys from Year 9 who are throwing their bags at each other and swearing quite loudly.
Two teachers on duty: one's cold and looking a bit fed up. The other is drinking some coffee from a mug that looks like a flask. Both of them are ignoring the two boys who are throwing bags and swearing.
Someone pushing into a queue for drinks - a couple of the Year 8's aren't too happy but they daren't say anything.
The caretaker changing a bin - it was empty this morning but is now overflowing with all sorts of rubbish. He smiles as he sees a packet of Crunchy Monster Feet - no wonder they didn't want to finish it.
Some of the Year 11 lads trying to act tough and showing off in front of some Year 10 girls. The girls say they aren't impressed, but they stay to find out a bit more.
The new deputy head telling off Sam from Year 8 - Sam has never seen the man before and is being just a little too cheeky for the deputy's liking.

Cells to systems - Cells and their functions
Humans are multi-cellular animals. That means we are made of lots of cells, not just one cell. The cells in many multi-cellular animals and plants are
, so that they can share out the processes of life. They work together like a team to support the different processes in an organism.
You should be able to work out special features of a cell from a drawing, if you are told what the cell can do. The tables below show examples of some specialised animal and plant cells, with their functions and special features.
Large surface area, for oxygen to pass through
To carry nerve impulses to different parts of the body
To join with male cell, and then to provide food for the new cell that's been formed
To reach female cell, and join with it
Head for getting into the female cell

If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE (see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer:
Do you think Romeo knows what love is?
Romeo is obviously a very sensitive young man. He seems to be exploring the idea of love. He may well long to be in love. Some of his ideas about love are confused and confusing.
Romeo does not join in with the street brawl and is sad that the violence takes place. He says that he understands that the violence is more to do with love and loyalty towards family than it is to do with hatred. He has been unhappy for some time and his family is worried. When Romeo talks to Benvolio, he finds it difficult to make himself clear. He is more interested in using language cleverly. When he uses oxymorons like 'heavy lightness' it is as though he isn't really sure what love is. When he talks about Rosaline, he focuses on her beauty. He says he loves her, but he is annoyed by her virtuous personality.
Romeo lives amongst people who will kill others and risk their own lives for the sake of their own family, so he knows about passion. The fact that he won't talk to his father about why he is unhappy isn't very loving. Romeo talks about love in an abstract way. He likes the idea of love, and he might have been influenced by what poets have said about love. It could be argued that if Romeo really loved Rosaline, then he would respect her wishes to remain a virgin. Towards the end of the extract, Romeo seems more interested in sex than true love.

332,"Imitation is a type of behaviour where one animal copies another animal. Humans often imitate each other, often without realising it. When people talk to each other, they may stand or sit in a similar way, and copy each others movements. Scientists think that this happens so that the speakers feel more at ease with other.
Some chimpanzees have been taught sign language by imitating people.
Imitation helps us to learn how to do new things. Your teachers often show you how to do something new, and then guide you as you try to repeat what they did.
Some scientists think that humans are the only animals that copy each other. Other scientists have observed chimpanzees and other primates imitating each other.
For example, chimpanzees can use sticks to spear juicy grubs to eat. Other chimpanzees copy this behaviour. In this way they learn new skills.

304,"> Decimals - Multiplying a decimal by a whole number
Decimals - Multiplying a decimal by a whole number
Multiplying a decimal by a whole number is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. Remember:
If there is one digit after the decimal point in the question, there will be one digit after the decimal point in the answer.
If there are two digits after the decimal point in the question, there will be two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer.
b) There was one digit after the decimal point in the question, so you must have one digit after the decimal point in the answer. The answer is therefore 12.0, but this can then be given as 12.
Check that you have a sensible answer by finding an approximate solution.
In the above example you were asked to calculate 2.4  5.
2  5 = 10, so you are looking for an answer which is slightly bigger than 10. So an answer of 12 seems sensible.

Formal and informal writing - Formal Language
Using formal language doesn't mean that you have to sound boring, you can still use words imaginatively in formal writing. News reports use formal language, but the words are rich and stimulating to keep the audience interested.
Q1. The two sentences below both use formal language to give us the same information. Which sentence do you think is best and why?
a) The bomb broke the windows of nearby buildings.
b) The blast shattered the windows of nearby buildings.
Q2. Which of the following should NOT use formal language?
b) A letter to the local paper
c) A speech to teachers or parents
d) A newspaper article aimed at adults
A1. Sentence b is better. Blast and shattered are far more descriptive than bomb and broke.
A2. Example a) should not be written with formal language. You wouldnt use formal language when writing to a close friend.
Tips for making your writing more formal
Make your writing clear and to the point.
Include some complex sentences in your writing. Try using semi-colons if you feel confident about using them correctly.
It's good to use figurative language if you think it fits in with the purpose and audience of the task. Metaphors and similes work well in speeches.
Don't use 'Well' or 'You know' or 'Anyway' or 'Like I just said' or any phrase that sounds like you are having a friendly chat.
Avoid using: 'And', 'But', 'Because' or 'So' at the beginning of a sentence.
Words like 'nice' and 'a lot' have no power. Try to think of more descriptive words eg 'delicious' or 'endless'.
Clichs are colourful phrases that people use all the time in speech. So often, in fact, that they seem worn out and boring in writing. Avoid phrases such as 'pretty as a picture', 'big as a house', 'skinny as a rake'.

128,"> Inform, explain and describe - Explaining
When you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give
. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions:
Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why?
This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now:
Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used.
This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this:
However, you can also put these together, like this:
Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions?
This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph.

Astronomy and space science - Years and seasons
A planet's year is the time it takes to make
around the Sun. The Earth goes once round the Sun in one Earth year. That's 365 Earth days.
We've seen already that that different planets take different lengths of time to orbit the Sun. That means their years are different lengths. Mercury has a year of just 88 Earth days, and Neptune has a year of 164 Earth years.
The Earth's axis is the imaginary line through the centre of the Earth between the South and North poles. This axis is
slightly compared to the way the Earth orbits the Sun.
We get different seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) because the Earth is tilted. This is how it works:
When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it is summer in the UK.
When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun it is winter in the UK.
When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere.
Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis the Sun moves higher in the sky in summer, when we tilt towards it, than in winter.

311,"There is an agreed order of operations in Maths called BODMAS.
All of these terms are fairly obvious except for 'Other', which are just powers (eg 2
So the order you should do your calculations in is
What is 4 + 2  3?
If you calculate the '4 + 2' part first you get:
4 + 2  3 = 6  3 = 18
If you calculate the '2  3' part first you get:
4 + 2  3 = 4 + 6 = 10
These are two very different answers, but only one is correct.
In BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition, so multiply 2 by 3 first.
4 + 2  3 = 4 + 6 = 10, so this is the right answer.

Electric current and voltage - Measuring amps & volts
You need to know how to measure current and voltage.
Current is a measure of how much
flows through a circuit. The more charge that flows, the bigger the current.
. For example, 20A is a bigger current than 5A.
A device called an ammeter is used to measure current. Some types of ammeter have a pointer on a dial, but most have a digital readout. To measure the current flowing through a component in a circuit, you must connect the ammeter in
Voltage is a measure of the difference in
between two parts of a circuit. The bigger the difference in energy, the bigger the voltage.
. For example, 230V is a bigger voltage than 12V.
Voltage is meaured using a voltmeter. Some types of voltmeter have a pointer on a dial, but most have a digital readout. To measure the voltage across a component in a circuit, you must connect the voltmeter in
Using a voltmeter to measure the voltage across a lamp
You can measure the voltage across a cell or battery. The more cells, the bigger the voltage.
The more cells, the bigger the voltage

Linear sequences - More on finding the nth term
So the sequence of numbers in the 5 times table has a common difference of 5 and an n
But what happens if things get more complicated?
The common difference is still 5, but it's not the 5 times table.
The 5 times table is 5, 10, 15, ...
The sequence is 7, 12, 17, ...
Each term in the sequence is 2 more than the corresponding term in the 5 times table, so the n
term of the Sequence: 8, 11, 14, ... ?
The common difference is 3, so it must be related to the 3 times table (3n)
The 3 times table is 3, 6, 9, ...
The sequence is 8, 11, 14, ....
Every term in the sequence is 5 more than the corresponding term in the 3 times table, so the n

258,"> Decimals - Adding and subtracting decimals
When adding and subtracting decimals, remember is to keep the decimal points in line in the question and the answer.
David is doing some DIY. He buys a 2m length of wood. He needs to cut two pieces of wood - one of length 0.6m and one of length 1.02m.
What is the total length of wood that David needs to cut?
So the total length of wood that David needs to cut is 1.62m.
You can add zeros to the end of a decimal without affecting its value, so 0.6 is the same as 0.60.
David originally had 2m of wood. What is the length of the piece of wood that is left?
David cut off 1.62m, so we need to calculate 2 - 1.62
So there is 0.38m of wood left.

383,"Humans show many of the same types of behaviour as other animals. But human behaviour is often more complex because we are more intelligent and aware of ourselves.
Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat.
Most people start smoking before they are adults
People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour. For example, young people may start smoking, drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result of copying each other to fit in.
Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people.
By associating the product with attractive images the advertisers are trying to set up a conditioned response to their product. People will respond positively and buy the product.

633,"> The Tempest Summary - The opening
The play opens on board a ship that is being battered by a storm - or tempest. The ship's crew are hard at work trying to stop the ship from sinking.
Antonio, brother of Prospero (a magician, who appears later)
They think they are going to drown.
The action moves to an island near where the ship is in trouble. Prospero, a magician, and his daughter Miranda, are living on the island with two others.
One is Ariel (a sprite, or elf-like character) - who'd once been kept in a tree by an evil witch, Sycorax. Prospero had released him from the tree with his magic.
The other is Caliban (big and nasty, the son of Sycorax) - who Prospero had been kind to. Both Ariel and Caliban are Prospero's servants.
Prospero, we now learn, had caused the storm on purpose. It was because of something that had happened long ago, as he tells Miranda ...
Twelve years earlier, he says, Prospero was the much loved Duke of Milan, a great city in Italy. Miranda was a young princess.
Prospero was always reading. This meant that his brother Antonio (who is on the ship in the storm) had so much power that he wanted more, and plotted against Prospero, with the help of the King, Alonso.
One night, Prospero tells Miranda, he and Miranda were seized, and sent out to sea alone in an open boat. They were lucky to survive, although Prospero's magic books were on the boat. Finally they came ashore on the island where they now live.
When his story is over, Prospero makes Miranda sleep before calling for Ariel, to find out how the plans he has made for the ship in the storm are going.

62,"> Linear sequences - HCF and LCM
The factors of a number are any numbers that divide into it exactly.
The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12
The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 18
1, 2, 3 and 6 are factors of both 12 and 18.
They are known as the common factors of 12 and 18.
So the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 12 and 18 is 6.
What is the HCF of 24 and 30?
The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24
The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30.
So the HCF of 24 and 30 is
The multiples of a number are all the numbers that it will divide into.
The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, ...
The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, ...
12, 24, and 36 are multiples of both 4 and 6 and are known as the common multiples of 4 and 6.
The lowest number that is a multiple of 4 and 6 is 12. So the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.
What is the LCM of 5 and 8?
The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40...
The mulitples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56...
So the LCM of 5 and 8 is

Cells to systems - Animal cells and plant cells
Animal cells usually have an irregular shape, and plant cells usually have a regular shape
Cells are made up of different parts. It is easier to explain what these parts are by using diagrams like the ones below.
Animal cells and plant cells both contain:
Plant cells also contain these parts, not found in animal cells:
The table summarises the functions of these parts.
Controls what substances can get into and out of the cell.
Jelly-like substance, where chemical reactions happen. In plant cells there's a thin lining, whereas in animal cells most of the cell is cytoplasm.
Controls what happens inside the cell. Carries genetic information.
call the nucleus the 'brain' of the cell. That is not a good description and will not get you marks.
Where photosynthesis happens  chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll.
Contains a liquid called cell sap, which keeps the cell firm.
Made of a tough substance called cellulose, which supports the cell.

The rock cycle - The rock cycle
Remember that there are three main types of rock:
, for example chalk, limestone, sandstone and shale;
The Earth's rocks do not stay the same forever. They are continually changing because of processes such as weathering and large earth movements. The rocks are gradually recycled over millions of years. This is called the rock cycle.
For example sedimentary rocks can be changed into metamorphic rocks, and these can be weathered and the pieces transported away. These pieces could be deposited in lakes or seas and eventually form new sedimentary rock. Many routes through the rock cycle are possible.
The processes in the rock cycle are shown in this diagram. Make sure that you understand how each type of rock forms, and be ready to give an example of each type of rock.

. Magma is liquid rock. Magma also comes from deeper inside the Earth, from an region called the mantle.
Pressure can forces magma out of the ground. This creates a volcano. When the magma cools it turns into solid rock, called

Areas of rock can move slowly upwards, pushed up by pressure of the rocks forming underneath. This is called

Wind and water move the broken rock particles away. This is called

624,"This map shows where Mount Vesuvius is located.
(veh-SOO-vee-uhss) majestically stands over the Italian landscape. The scenic mountain rises 4,200 feet high southeast of the city of Naples, which is located in southern Italy. But many people living in this region fear Mount Vesuvius. That's because it is an active volcano.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling
poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano.
The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury.
Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944.
Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told
. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode].""
Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone.""
Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption.
The volcano's past, however, hasn't stopped people from moving into the area. In fact, Italian officials are concerned about the overcrowding of people in the red zone. To encourage people to move away from this area, they have put a plan in place.
Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years.
In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there.
""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents.""
A volcano is a mountain with an opening on the top called a
A volcano erupts when hot, melted rock called magma collects in chambers beneath Earth's surface. Pressure builds up in the chambers and causes
, gases, ash, and other materials to blast out of the top of the volcano and
, or cracks, along its sides. Once outside the volcano, the magma is called lava.

319,"One former teacher doesn't miss a beat with schoolkids today. As a child, David Wish took violin lessons but dreamed of playing the guitar. He would stand in front of a mirror with a broom and pretend it was his guitar.
Wish eventually quit the violin and learned how to play the guitar. Today, he shares his love of rock-and-roll with schoolkids across the country.
, about a musician who pretends to be a teacher, wasn't left only to the imaginations of filmmakers.
In real life, Wish and other musicians have created their own schools of rock.
In 1996, Wish started a program called Little Kids Rock. The program reaches about 2,000 children in public schools in New York City and San Francisco along with Memphis, Tennessee and Newark, New Jersey.
Little Kids Rock puts free instruments in the hands of students where music programs have been cut. Though some of the classes are part of the school day, many are held before or after school.
Wish enlisted the help of many famous performers. Among the celebrities are singers Bonnie Raitt and Carlos Santana, blues artist B.B. King, and longtime Billy Joel drummer Liberty DeVitto. They participate in the program because they believe that music is just as important as math or social studies in school.
""When I got a guitar for Christmas [as a child], I found my voice,"" Raitt told a group of students on a visit to a California school.
The program made an impact on one third-grade student in New York City. In addition to becoming a baseball player, his career plans now include becoming a singer. He said, ""I could sit in the [dugout] and sing Lil' Bow Wow.""

65,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two candidates for president stand on important
, or problems facing the country. This weeks issue is
refers to the making and buying of products. The economy goes through good and bad times. Both candidates want to work on improving the economy because many workers in the United States have lost their jobs over the past few years.
The candidates have been discussing another important part of the economy--
. American companies and people pay tax money to the government to support public programs. Those programs include building roads and supporting schools and the military.
President Bush thinks that lowering taxes will create more jobs. He says that if the government lowers taxes, businesses will have extra money to hire more workers. In addition, he says, lowering taxes will give people more money to spend on products and services.
Senator Kerry thinks that creating more jobs is the best way to help businesses grow. He thinks that the government currently gives too many tax breaks to wealthy people and large companies. He wants people who make a lot of money to pay more in taxes than families who dont make as much.

439,"This guinea pig wouldn't make a very good class pet. That's because it was about the size of a buffalo! Scientists recently discovered the fossils of a giant rodent that weighed 1,545 pounds and lived 6 million to 8 million years ago.
This cousin of the rat is believed to be the largest rodent that ever roamed Earth. Scientists unearthed its skeleton in a dry region of Venezuela. That is a country in South America.
""Imagine a weird guinea pig, but huge, with a long tail for balancing on its hind legs,"" said the lead scientist behind the find.
Nicknamed ""Goya,"" the rodent lived in an area that once was made up of grassy marshes. Along with the giant crocodiles and giant turtles of the time, Goya lived along the banks of a swamp.
There, it used its long teeth to dine on large amounts of grasses. At about 9 feet long and 4 feet tall, the rodent couldn't move very fast. Its hefty size made it very difficult to outrun an attacking animal. A changing climate and threats from other animals might have caused the animal's extinction, say scientists.

509,"Its a bird! Its a plane! Its ""Fearless Felix""! Felix is not a fictional superhero like Superman. Hes a stuntman from Austria, a country in Europe.
At the end of July, Felix broke a world record. He became the first person to fly across the English Channel without an aircraft. The English Channel is a body of water that separates England from France.
Felix began his adventure by jumping from a plane 30,000 feet above the coast of England. That is about as high as Mount Everest. Felix parachuted down until he landed in a town on the coast of France. It took him about 14 minutes to cross the Channel, flying at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour.
Felix wore a special suit and had a gliding wing strapped to his back. He carried oxygen with him to help him breathe. Thats because the air that high up is very thin.
Felix, who began parachuting as a teenager, referred to another piece of flying history. ""Its [100 years ago] that the Wright brothers were doing the first flight with a plane,"" he said, ""and now Im here, with my little wing.""

87,"Journey to the Center of the Earth
What's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core.
No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there.
For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core.
Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets.
Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat.
Scientist J. Marvin Herndon says the nuclear reaction in the core triggers volcanoes, moves the giant plates of rock that make up Earth's surface, and causes a magnetic field to surround our planet.
Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge.
Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears.
Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time.
If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever.
The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.

464,"More violence erupted in the Middle East this summer. The conflict involved the countries of Israel and Lebanon. It started when Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon killed three Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others. Hezbollah is an Arab group that does not recognize Israel's right to exist. Israel was founded in 1948 as a homeland for Jewish people. Hezbollah says Israel took over land that belongs to Arabs.
Israel responded to the Hezbollah attack with force. Israeli planes bombed Hezbollah neighborhoods in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. They also hit Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. Israeli army troops crossed the border and fought with Hezbollah.
As a result, Hezbollah launched missiles at Israel. Hundreds have been killed in the conflict. The United States and other nations sent ships and planes to evacuate their citizens living in or visiting Lebanon.
Israel said it would not withdraw its troops until Hezbollah released the Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah has demanded that the Israeli soldiers be exchanged for Lebanese prisoners held in Israel.
World leaders looked for a way to end the fighting as tensions continued to grow. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged a stop to the violence. ""We must say, to the people of Lebanon, to the people of Israel ... that we will do our utmost to help them find a path towards peace.""

97,"Hiram Bingham lived for adventure. In 1911, the American explorer trekked through the jungles of Peru. He was searching for clues to explain how the once-mighty Inca Empire had disappeared.
His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff.
After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo).
Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak.""
Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum.
""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told
. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects.""
that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago.
Machu Picchu is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas.
The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina.
Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s.
When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time,
have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.)
The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there.
Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants.
The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish
(conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule.
Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year.
Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen.
Machu Picchu, which is located in Peru, was a city of palaces, temples, farms, and small houses.
Many of the buildings at Machu Picchu are made of large stones. The stones are so tightly wedged together that a piece of paper cannot fit between them.
Machu Picchu's farmland was carved into steps because it was hard for farmers to plow up and down the mountain. That allowed farmers to plant crops on the flat parts of the land and prevented rain from washing soil downhill.
The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?

If you are like many kids, you surf the Internet, write e-mails, and use instant messaging to contact your friends. You probably listen to your favorite songs on a portable CD player. You might even take pictures and send them to otherswith a cell phone!
Would you believe that 25 years ago computers, CDs, and cell phones as you know them didn't exist? In fact, much of the technology you use today was very different then.
A group of technology leaders was organized by the Lemelson-MIT Program. Those leaders recently made a list of the top 25 innovations from the last 25 years. An
is a new invention or a new way of improving something.
The items on the list have improved since 1980, according to the group. Each of the chosen items has had ""a direct impact on our everyday lives and could dramatically affect our lives in the future.""
Can you guess which innovation was crowned ""tech king""? The Internet, of course! The Internet took the top spot because it has provided people with access to a world of information.
Coming in second was the cell phone. In 1980, a cell phone was so large that it barely fit in a purse. Before 1980, some computers, which took third place, filled an entire room!
How much has technology changed in the past 25 years? Take a look at a few of the improvements that have been made.
Cell phones weighed about 2 pounds and were almost a foot long. Very few people had one.
Cell phones weigh less than half a pound and are small enough to fit in a coat pocket.
TVs had screens with minimal details; some were still black and white! Most kids tuned TVs to
High-definition televisions (HDTVs) produce high-quality, lifelike images. Many Americans have their TVs tuned to reality shows, such as
35mm cameras used film to take pictures. The film had to be developed to see the imagesa process that usually took hours.

50,"NASA shoots for the moon, then Mars.
This drawing shows what the moon base might look like.
Only 12 people have set foot on the moonso far. The last time was in late 1972, when two astronauts walked on its surface. Their final visitthe longest of anylasted just three days. Now astronauts are preparing for another mission to our space neighbor. This time, though, they plan to stay there.
NASA recently announced plans to build a permanent base on the moon. Astronauts could be living and working there by 2020, according to the U.S space agency. The goal is to prepare astronauts for a trip to Mars in the future.
Under the plan, four-person crews will begin with weeklong missions to the moon. By 2024, when more equipment has been set up, astronauts will be able to
or live, on the moon for as long as six months. Astronauts will travel in roving vehicles to explore the area near the
Unlike Earth, the moon has no air, wind, or weather. Its dusty
or surface, is covered with deep craters. So how can humans survive on the moon?
NASA hopes to establish a lunar outpost near one of the moon's poles. ""These locations experience sunlight for longer periods of time than other locations on the moon, which will make it possible to use solar power,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told
Solar power is energy from the sun that can be used to generate electricity.
It is also likely that the polar regions are rich in natural resources, such as oxygen and hydrogen. While on the moon, astronauts plan to use natural resources for water and fuel.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. About 238,900 miles away, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor.
On July 20, 1969, Americans Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. Those space pioneers traveled to the lunar surface on the
or greatly exceed, the Apollo missions of the 1960s and early 1970s. ""This is not your father's Apollo,"" says spacepolicy expert John Logsdon at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
As part of its new phase of space exploration, NASA will
or stop using, its aging space shuttle fleet by 2010. For their trek to the moon, astronauts will travel aboard the new
crew exploration vehicle, which is being developed. The vehicle, a modernized version of the
craft, will attach to a lunar lander.
The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's longterm space plan. The proposed base is the first step in the bold plan to prepare astronauts for their ultimate destinationMars.
Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. Astronauts will not be able to bring enough supplies for the entire mission. They will have to use the elements on Mars to survive.
""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" says Braukus of NASA.
While some supporters are jumping over the moon about launching a new era of space exploration, not everyone is pleased with the plan. Critics warn that it will be difficult to fund the moon program. So far, NASA has not put a price tag on the mission but welcomes participation by other countries to help carry out its plan.
In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched
the first artificial satellite in space. The U.S. space program was established as a response. The ""space race"" between the two countries had begun. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to send a person to the moon by the end of the 1960s. The time line shows some U.S. space milestones and NASA's plans for the lunar base.
What qualities would astronauts need to have to live and work on the moon?

490,"Mount Etna blew its top last summer. The volcano blasted molten lava nearly 1 mile into the sky.
, scientists who study volcanoes, rushed to the mountain. Mount Etna is on Sicily, an island that is a part of Italy.
The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt.
Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist.
Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many
, or holes, along the volcano's sides.
Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke.
Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano.
The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes.
Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening.

290,"In 1970, only one in ten kids in the United States was overweight. In the 1980s, one-third of kids were overweight. In the 1990s, three-fifths of kids were overweight. A new study links the increase in the number of overweight kids to an increase in the amount of TV kids watch.
""We found that kids who were [light] TV watchers were [thinner]. The kids who were the fattest were those who watch a lot of TV,"" said Dr. Carlos Crespo. Crespo and Dr. Ross Anderson wrote the study.
The doctors said kids today watch more TV than kids did 30 years ago. Today, one in three kids watches four or more hours of TV a day. Watching that much TV, they said, is unhealthful.
According to the doctors, kids are not entirely to blame for watching too much TV. Part of the problem comes from a lack of safe places for kids to play.
Crespo and Anderson aren't against watching TV, as long as kids limit the time they spend in front of the tube.
""There are a certain number of hours in the day you're supposed to sleep [and] do your homework,"" said Crespo. ""You're supposed to go to school, and then there is a certain amount of hours that you are free to do whatever you want. If you spend that time watching TV, then you spend less time doing physical activity.""

781,"One 12-year-old boy gets a ride to school each day from his mom. But he's not on his way to middle school. Instead, he gets dropped off at medical school.
Sho Yano (SHOH YAH-noh) is the youngest person to attend medical school at the University of Chicago in Illinois. He plans to graduate around age 19 or 20. That puts him on the path to being one of the youngest people to graduate from medical school.
""I was always interested in science and medicine,"" he told CNN. ""And I also always wanted to help people. And medicine and science seemed like the perfect combination.""
This doctor-in-the-making started college at age 9, when most kids his age were in fourth grade. Although he graduated from college three years later, today he still considers himself a regular 12-year-old. He has a pet rabbit and often squabbles with his younger sister.

""I hope that someday women will have the same rights as men. Like women football and baseball leagues. Maybe even a [woman] president. If that happens, do you think one of your daughters could become president like you?""
Nearly 4,000 third and fourth graders from every state and Washington, D.C., have written letters to President George W. Bush. Their letters express their hopes, dreams, and concerns for the country.
The letters were assembled into what is being called the longest letter in the world. The giant letter, which stretched for one-half mile, was rolled out on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in September. Students tackled some tough topics in their lettersthe war in Iraq, violence, homelessness, a cure for diabetes, the environment, and even better pay for teachers.
The Pilot Pen company and the National Council of Teachers of English came up with the idea for the project. Thanks to the Internet, the letter can keep growing.

538,"Scientists are using the latest technology to solve a 4,500-year-old mystery. They want to discover where two narrow passageways inside the Great Pyramid lead.
This winter, scientists are sending a small robot into the Great Pyramid for a second time. In 2002, they sent the robot through the pyramids tight passageways.
After crawling through the corridors and drilling through a thick stone door, the robot revealed nothing but another closed door! This time, scientists hope to solve the puzzle of what lies behind door number two.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest pyramid in Egypt. Giza is located on the Nile River, near the capital of Cairo. The Great Pyramid is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Those structures were built between 4,500 and 2,200 years ago. Of the ancient wonders, only the Great Pyramid remains today.
The ancient pyramids were built as burial places for
or kings, of Egypt. It took workers 20 years to construct those monuments. Some scientists believe that the Great Pyramid was the burial place for Egypts pharaoh Khufu.
No one knows what happened to Khufu or whether he was buried with his treasures. Some scientists believe that the two tight shafts might lead to his undiscovered tomb. ""People all over the world are waiting to solve [the mystery of the pyramid],"" Egypt expert Zahi Hawaas told reporters.
A New Seventh Wonder of the World?
Perched atop a hill in Germany, the castle above is one of 200 worldwide choices for the New Seven Wonders of the World vote. The castle is called Neuschwanstein (NOY-shvan-stine) and was built in the late 1800s as a royal palace. Does it look familiar? Cinderellas castle at Disneyland is modeled after it. The winner of the global vote will be announced on January 1, 2007. To learn more about the vote and the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, visit

502,"Americans eat 17 billion quarts of popcorn each year.
Popcorn has made a name for itself in the state where Abraham Lincoln lived before he became president. In August, popcorn was made the official state snack food of Illinois.
The popular movie snack food joins the cardinal, which is the state bird, and the white oak, which is the state tree, on the list of state symbols. Illinois is among the top states in the country where popcorn is grown.
The idea to raise popcorn to a new level came from a group of second- and third-grade students. They called themselves the Kernel Kids.
The governor of the state signed the bill into law in a library near Cunningham Elementary School, where the Kernel Kids attended class last school year. He said the project gave students a firsthand look at how a bill becomes a law.
To celebrate, government officials, teachers, students, and parents munched on the honored snack. The Kernel Kids wore popcorn hats that they made for the special day. ""We feel good,"" a 9-year-old student said. ""We did something that not many other kids usually get to do. It makes us really proud--and our parents.""
Their teacher was also proud of her students' efforts. ""I'm so happy for these kids,"" she said. ""They worked so hard. They'll probably remember this for the rest of their lives.""

749,"is located off the coast of Key Largo, Florida.
Astronauts are diving into a new kind of mission. Their special voyage is taking them more than 60 feet beneath the ocean's surface.
The astronauts--called ""aquanauts""--are training for space missions in an underwater laboratory called
. The lab rests on the ocean floor off the coast of Florida.
The latest ocean mission began October 11, when three astronauts and a doctor from Canada took the plunge. The crew's job includes testing medical equipment that may be used to treat astronauts when they get sick in space.
The journey marks the seventh mission the U.S. space agency, NASA, has made to
. The 10-day mission is referred to as NEEMO 7 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations).
Astronauts are using the underwater lab to learn what it may be like to live and work in space. They are preparing for extreme environments, such as the moon and the planet Mars. The conditions underwater are similar to those in space.
The goal of this latest voyage, or
, is to learn how to treat patients in space from a distance. Part of the underwater mission involves performing robotic surgery on a fake patient. Doctors on land have guided the astronauts through the procedure.
Why is exploring this technology important? ""Astronauts navigating between planets won't be able to turn around and come home when someone gets sick,"" said NEEMO's project manager, Bill Todd, ""and this undersea mission will help us [respond to medical emergencies in space].""
is the only underwater training center and research laboratory of its kind. The astronauts live, sleep, and work there. The lab, which is 45 feet long, has some of the comforts of home.
is equipped with bunks, a shower, computers, and even a refrigerator and microwave. Plus it has an ocean view!

491,"In May and June, the weather is warm, days are getting longer, and many U.S. kids are looking forward to the end of the school year. Now, some schools are thinking about extending the school year--to July or even August!
Most U.S. kids go to school for 180 days per year. But is that long enough? Many people don't think so. California's governor, Gray Davis, recently said he wants schools in his state to add 30 days to the school calendar. Across the country, other schools are adding on days and weeks.
Some teachers say they have more to teach than ever before and could use the extra time. They teach more and harder subjects and provide additional information on topics such as safety and ethics.
Moreover, many educators worry that summer vacation is a waste of time. Many parents work away from the home, and many kids spend summers home alone or at camps that do not stress education. ""What you have is three months of time in which kids forget what they've learned and get into trouble,"" said Delaine Eastin, an educator in California.
Not everyone agrees that kids need to spend more time in school. Some say that schools need to make better use of the time they already have.
School Days per Year in Four Countries
""Quality is the key to making time matter,"" said education expert Julie Aronson, who is the author of a report called
Improving Student Achievement by Extending School: Is It Just a Matter of Time?
""Only when time is used more effectively will adding more of it result in improved learning for students,"" said Aronson.

335,"For 20 days in February and March, explosions and cannon fire blew up two huge statues located in Afghanistan, a country in Asia. The statues had been carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the Bamiyan Valley about 1,500 years ago.
The statues, one 120 feet tall and the other 175 feet tall, were of the religious leader Buddha (BOO-duh), the founder of Buddhism.
Many art and history experts say the statues were historic treasures. ""They were among the most stunning [statues] I've ever seen,"" said. Professor James Fisher of Carleton College in Minnesota.
The Taliban, the religious group that rules most areas of Afghanistan, ordered the destruction of the two statues. (
In 1996, the Taliban seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, and took control of most of the country. The Taliban and a large majority of people who live in the country are Muslims. They practice a religion called Islam.
The Taliban said their holy book, the Koran, forbids the creation or worship of statues. Before the statues were destroyed, a Taliban leader said, ""Because... these statues are there to be worshipped, and that is wrong, they should be destroyed.""
Throughout the world, leaders were outraged after learning that the Taliban planned the destruction of the huge statues. World leaders and officials from the United Nations (U.N.) tried to stop the destruction. Iran, a country where most people are Muslims, asked the Taliban not to blow up the statues. Japan, a country where Buddhism is widely practiced, threatened to withhold money that the country had planned to send to Afghanistan.
Now many people are mourning the loss of the statues. ""It is [horrible] to witness the... destruction of [historic monuments], which were the [history] of the whole of humanity,"" said a U.N. representative.

440,"What do you get when you cross blueberries with meat? Sometimes you get a blueberry hamburger! Some scientists hope that blueberry burgers will soon be on your school cafeteria's menu.
(WR) that his lab has experimented with adding blueberry powder and blueberry
(PYOO-ray) to beef, chicken, and turkey. Puree is a thick paste. It's made when fruit is mashed in a blender.
Why the odd food combination? Bushway says it's a way to increase the nutrition in meat. Blueberries are rich in special chemicals that help fight diseases, such as cancer. Bushway hopes to make school lunches more healthful.
Do blueberries turn the meat blue? ""In beef, you can't see the difference,"" Bushway told WR. ""However, ground turkey turns a grayish blue color.""
With an adult's help, kids can try this fruit-and-meat combo at home, says Bushway. He recommends thawing 1/2 to 1 ounce of frozen blueberries, pureeing them, and adding them to meat.
So far, many adult taste tasters have been giving the food the thumbs up. But will it be a hit with kids? One 8-year-old from Illinois said she would love to try a blueberry burger. Her 11-year-old sister didn't feel the same. ""I like my hamburger with ketchup,"" she said.

13,"the wooden puppet wants to become a real boy. Whenever he tells a lie, his nose grows. The books author, Carlo Collodi, might have been onto something. According to some researchers, there is truth to the tale.
""Your nose does grow when you lie,"" Dr. Alan Hirsch of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation told
According to Hirsch, tissues of the nose expand when a person tells a fib, causing the nose to itch. That may be why many people scratch their noses when they lie. That urge to scratch has been called ""the Pinocchio effect.""
The knowledge is being applied to computer programs that detect tiny changes in facial expressions. Police can use the information to tell whether someone is lying.

388,"Did NASCAR Have to Lose a Legend?
Daytona Beach, Florida--As millions of racing fans watched the closing lap of the Daytona 500 car race last month, they saw a familiar sight. Dale Earnhardt, nicknamed ""the Intimidator,"" was near the front of the pack.
In an instant, however, Earnhardt's car swerved and slammed into the track's concrete wall. That crash instantly killed the legendary driver, who was considered the Michael Jordan of NASCAR racing. (
stands for National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.)
When Earnhardt's car, painted with the driver's well-known number 3, slammed into the wall, he was traveling at 180 miles per hour. According to doctors who examined Earnhardt, the racing legend died of a head injury caused by the crash.
Many safety experts say that if Earnhardt had been wearing a HANS device, he might have survived the crash.
The device is a rigid collar that slips over a driver's uniform and rests on his or her shoulders. Two straps connect the helmet to the collar, locking the helmet in place. The device is designed to prevent a driver's head from whipping forward or side to side in an accident.
NASCAR driver Robby Gordon ordered a HANS device immediately after the race in which Earnhardt was killed. ""As a direct result of what happened at the [Daytona] 500, I have ordered the support system,"" said Gordon.
NASCAR officials say they will look more closely at the device and may require drivers to wear it in the future. Until then, drivers, who are well aware of the risks in their sport, will continue to get behind the wheel.

306,"Kids play a game at the Sophie B. Wright Charter School during a Gulf Coast WalkAbout program.
As the school year begins, how has the Gulf Coast changed since Katrina?
""I cried when I saw my house,"" Chakia Boutte told
The 12-year-old's New Orleans neighborhood looks different from the way it looked a year ago. Chakia points to a block of homes that were damaged when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. ""All these houses used to be fixed up,"" she says. Chakia's own home flooded in the storm last year.
More than 1,300 people died in the storm, and many more lost their homes. Hurricane Katrina is the costliest natural disaster in American history. Relief and recovery costs from the storm are nearing $100 billion.
Some areas are coming back to life. Along the Mississippi coast, homes and businesses are being rebuilt. Volunteer camps are full of people eager to help.
Other places look as though Katrina passed through one month, rather than one year, ago. In New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward, abandoned homes sit waiting to be
or torn down. Overturned cars and uprooted trees line the streets. The air smells of mold and garbage.
This fall, Chakia will attend school in Texas. She has lived there since her family fled the hurricane. Other families are returning to New Orleans. About 55 of the city's 128 public schools are scheduled to reopen in time for the new school year. Though the public school system will be able to accommodate 34,000 students, only 20,000 are expected to attend.
""Parents have been very reluctant to bring young children back to the city,"" New Orleans City Councilmember Cynthia Hedge-Morrell told
In New Orleanss Lower Ninth Ward, flooded homes floated off their foundations during the hurricane. Here, a home sits on top of an overturned truck.
In New Orleans, about half of the city's former population of 450,000 has returned. Electricity and phone service are still out in the hardest-hit areas. The city's roads are full of potholes. Mail delivery is slow. Grocery stores, banks, and hospitals remain boarded up.
The federal government has invested billions in a program known as the Road Home. The program will provide money for Louisiana residents to rebuild or sell their storm-damaged houses.
The most urgent task is protecting New Orleans against another hurricane. The
structures that prevent floodingcollapsed during Hurricane Katrina.
Although the damaged levee system has been repaired and improved, it is still not designed to handle a storm like Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers is preparing plans for Congress that will propose ways to protect New Orleans against the strongest hurricanes.
On the Gulf Coast, people speak of life in terms of ""before Katrina"" and ""after Katrina."" ""My life before the hurricane was so beautiful,"" says Myeisha McDaniels, 13. ""I had just made the dance team. My mom was just letting me go to the movies by myself. I was mad the hurricane came and messed everything up.""
Myeisha and other kids who have returned to New Orleans want to help rebuild the city. As part of a summer program called Gulf Coast WalkAbout, kids built bus stop benches and planted flowers in a park that had flooded during Katrina. They also reflected on their hurricane experiences.
In a journal entry, 12-year-old Duriel Harris wrote: ""I am now used to a whole new lifestyle. ... Every day now is different from my pre-Katrina days.""
Over the summer, kids in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas participated in the Gulf Coast WalkAbout program. They helped rebuild their communities. Here are some of the projects kids in New Orleans completed.
Kids painted trash cans, picked up litter, and planted flowers at a park that had flooded during Hurricane Katrina.
Kids recorded their hurricane experiences. Duriel Harris, 12, explains his family tree. His familys home was flooded in the storm.
After noticing that people were sitting on stoops or overturned buckets as they waited for buses, kids built two bus stop benches.

168,"Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world
The highest point on Earth just got a little lower. A team of Chinese scientists reports that Mount Everest is now 29,017 feetabout 12 feet less than China's previous measurement. Mount Everest is part of the Himalaya mountain range. The Himalayas stretch through the countries of Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, and Bhutan.
Scientists say that Everest hasn't shrunk since it was last measured. The previous measurements were just less accurate. ""When we conducted the survey in 1975, the equipment was much poorer,"" says scientist Chen Bangzhu.
Bangzhu and other Chinese researchers climbed to the top of Everest last May because they feared it might be shrinking due to
. Global warming is a gradual increase in Earth's temperature.
on the mountain to melt, say some scientists. Glaciers are huge sheets of slow-moving ice. Although the melting glaciers aren't the cause of Mount Everest's change in height, the rise in Earth's temperature has scientists worried.
More than two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers are already melting. This could spell disaster for countries such as China, India, and Nepal, which depend on rivers fed by melting snow from the glaciers for water.
Despite the loss of a few feet, Everest is still the highest point above sea level. Its peak lies on the border between China and Nepal. The mountain was named after Sir George Everest, who mapped much of South Asia between 1830 and 1843.

410,"South America's frog populations are on the decline. That spells trouble for the environment.
Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health.
The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers. Bumpy-skinned toads use their sticky tongues to catch mosquitoes and other prey. Colorful poison dart frogs rest on tree branches. These brightly colored frogs are packed with poison, which protects them from their enemies.
, or types, of frogs and toads in Ecuador are at risk of dying out. According to a recent report by the group NatureServe, eight frogs have become
, or died out, in North and South America in the last 100 years. ""It's the same magnitude event as the extinction of the dinosaurs,"" says scientist Luis Coloma.
. Amphibians are animals with backbones that spend part of their life in water and part on land. Frogs and toads lay jellylike eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which breathe through gills. As the tadpoles grow into frogs or toads, they develop lungs and live on land.
Like reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, amphibians are
. That means their body temperature depends on the environment. Unlike reptiles, amphibians lack protective scales. Amphibians must live near water so that their skin stays moist.
Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing.
Why are these creatures in trouble? Their
is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations.
Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told
Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with
, or wrongly shaped, body parts, such as extra legs and eyes. When frogs with strange body parts are found in an area, it is a clue that the environment is polluted or suffering.
Scientists are fighting to save amphibians. Some scientists believe that South America's poison dart frogs have chemicals in their body that can be used to treat diseases, such as cancer. The scientists want governments to pass laws that will reduce pollution and to create parks that protect the amphibians' habitat.
""Almost half of the extinctions are happening for unknown reasons,"" scientist Robert Kaplan told
. ""Scientists have a lot of work to do, and quickly.""
Here are some of Ecuador's threatened frogs and toads.
live in top layers of trees and come down to the ground only once a year, on a moonless night, to lay eggs.
live in trees and have translucent, or almost see-through, skin. The creature's red heart is visible from the outside.
have colorful, smooth skin, often with spots or streaks of orange, red, yellow, blue, or green.
Why is it important for scientists to know whether an area is polluted?

603,"Bello Nock recently raced up a thin wire on a motorcycle. He drove the motorcycle high over thousands of spectators' heads. He's a clown with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus.
To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe.
Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground.
To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered.
By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall.
Bello often carries a heavy metal stick when he performs. The stick bends downward, lowering his center of gravity.
Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago.
Newton's first law of motion says that a moving object will keep moving unless an outside force acts on it. (The law also says that an object at rest will stay that way unless an outside force acts on it.) Bello uses that law when he rides his
As Bello speeds along on his tiny bike, he sometimes has to stop before slamming into a wall. To stop, Bello uses the bike's brakes. The brakes create
between the bike's tires and the ground. The friction is an outside force that slows the bike.
Friction also changes the bike's motion into heat energy. You could say that Bello's act is really hot!
How do you use science in your everyday life? Discuss in class and let us know what you think in the Write On section of
To see how friction works, rub your hands together as fast as you can. When you rub your hands together, they should start to feel warm. Friction between your hands changes into heat energy.
Bello always puts on a high-energy show. ""I always want to capture the attention of children,"" he said. He captures their attention with science.

751,"In late October, fountains of hot liquid rock burst from one of the most famous volcanoes in the world-Mount Etna.
Mount Etna is located on the island of Sicily, which is part of Italy. Rivers of molten rock, or
, flowed down the sides of the volcano, burning everything in its path.
Some of superheated rivers of lava flowed toward towns. In an attempt to stop the advancing lava, airplanes dropped thousands of gallons on water on it. Fearing for their lives, many people fled from their homes.
The volcano also shot thick flakes of hot ash into the sky. Much of the ash rained down on nearby towns. Some of it rose high into the atmosphere. Winds blew the ash up to 400 miles from the volcano.
People in Sicily have lived with Mount Etna for a long time. The first recorded eruption happened about 3,500 years ago. Since then, Mount Etna has erupted more than 250 times. In 1669, an earthquake triggered by an eruption killed nearly 20,000 people.
The volcano's last large eruption was in 1992. Scientists used explosives to move the rivers of lava away from towns. Today, people are still learning to live with the volcano.

204,"Colonial Williamsburg is the worlds largest ""living history museum."" The restored capital of Virginia is a place where actors live, work, dress, and even talk as people did in the 1700s. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson once walked the streets of the city.
Tourists from all around the world visit Colonial Williamsburg each year. Now the living museum is using a modern invention to educate people about the past
Podcasts are digital files that are made available on the Internet. The files can be downloaded to computers, cell phones, or portable music players.
Some of the podcasts are interviews with the people who work to make Colonial Williamsburg come alive. They include cooks, tradespeople, musicians, carpenters, and others. One podcast is about barrel making. Another is about religious freedom in the 1700s. A third is about slave life before the American Revolution (17751783).
Currently, people anywhere in the world can listen to
(sound-only) podcasts from Colonial Williamsburg. In the future, the people at Colonial Williamsburg want to take podcasts a step further. They want to produce video podcasts, called vodcasts.
""History is old, but its presentation doesnt have to be,"" says Robyn Eoff, Colonial Williamsburgs Internet director. The audio podcasts are available at

724,"Harry Potter, you have company. Meet the Baudelaire children--three unlucky orphans who are pursued for their fortune by the villain Count Olaf.
The mastermind behind the orphans misery is the mysterious author Lemony Snicket (also known as Daniel Handler). His newest dark book,
marks the 11th title in the gloomy and funny
books. The latest adventure takes the orphans underwater. They find themselves in dangerous surroundings, aboard a submarine and in a cave filled with poisonous mushrooms.
is probably the most depressing and woeful story yet,"" Lemony Snicket cautions Grade 4 readers.
Readers dont seem to be listening to the authors warnings about his dreadful tales. The first 10 books in the series have sold more than 18 million copies.
The popularity of the book series has also caught the attention of Hollywood. A movie starring Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf will hit theaters this upcoming holiday season.
Will the orphans luck ever change? ""The fate of the orphans gets better all the time, and then it turns around and gets worse again,"" the author told us. ""The trick is to enjoy the brief moments of good faith that were all given before unfortunate events engulf us once more.""

138,"Olivia, Wilbur, Curious George, and some other animals are making a leapfrom the pages of childrens books onto stamps! On January 10, the United States Postal Service began issuing a series of eight colorful stamps. They feature some of the favorite childrens book animals of all time.
Thanks to a huge letterwriting campaign from book fans, you can add the muchloved creatures to your mail. ""The postal service gets more than 50,000 cards and letters each year with suggestions for new stamps,"" spokesperson Mark Saunders told
A stamp committee then reviews the choices and decides on 20 to 25 subjects for the year.

736,"It's no surprise to Kristielle Pedraza that she finds the same group of people absent from school every day--the boys. Kristielle, 13, attends the first all-girls public school in Dallas.
All-girls and all-boys public schools are popping up across the United States. In the past eight years, the number of U.S. public schools offering all-girls and all-boys classes has jumped from eight to 140.
Some school officials say kids at all-girls and all-boys schools get better grades because there are fewer discipline problems and there is less peer pressure. Supporters, or
, believe girls and boys do better in school when they are taught separately because they learn differently.
Leonard Sax founded a group in favor of all-girls and all-boys schools. He says girls perform better in quieter classroom settings and boys do better when asked rapid-fire questions.
""John Kerry, George W. Bush, his father, and Al Gore all went to all-boys schools,"" Sax told The Associated Press. ""We don't think that is a coincidence.""
Not everyone agrees that all-girls and all-boys schools are a good idea. Some critics, including many women's groups, believe they
, or go against, the U.S. Constitution.
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees all people equal treatment under the law. Critics argue that separating boys and girls in public schools can result in an unfair and unequal environment.
Others say it does not prepare students for the working world when they grow up. ""We live in a real world, and that world has got men and women in it,"" women's rights leader Eleanor Smeal told CNN. ""They must compete.""

707,"Elementary school kids across the nation burn a lot of hours playing video games, surfing the Internet, and watching TV. Some schools have reduced recess and gym time. Those add up to one big problem: Kids are not getting enough exercise.
Parents, teachers, and health experts are concerned. According to a new report issued by the American Heart Association, 8.8 million kids and teens weigh too much. The report shows that 15 percent of 6- to 11-year-olds are overweight. This is more than double from 20 years ago.
""Although children may not realize it now, they are setting themselves up for a lifetime of health problems,"" said one doctor. Experts say that overweight kids are at risk for developing heart problems and diabetes as adults.
To help kids develop good health habits, some schools are adding gym classes back into the curriculum. Others are
, or changing, gym routines so they extend beyond traditional team sports. One school district in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, has added climbing walls to 13 of its 17 elementary schools. Others are offering dance, aerobics, and kite flying to help kids get fit.
The goal of physical education is to keep kids active for life-inside school and out. Many schools are stressing the importance of fitness at a young age. One gym teacher said that physical education classes combine fitness with fun to encourage children to lead healthful, active lifestyles.
Daily exercise offers enormous benefits to children. Research shows that kids who exercise do better in school. They also have improved self-esteem and feel better about themselves in general. Now, that's something to get worked up about!

27,"It's a sad day in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the host of
, has said that he will tape the last show in the long-running TV series this year.
Rogers, who has been on TV for 50 years, has starred in
for 33 years. In all, Rogers, who is 71 years old, has made about 1,000 episodes of the show. (Your parents may have watched the show when they were growing up!)
Over the years, the TV show has discussed many issues that are important to kids. David Newell plays deliveryman Mr. McFeely on the program. He said Rogers made shows about ""subjects such as a new baby [in a family] or dealing with angry feelings.""

94,"On December 6, two airplane passengers attracted a lot of attention at an airport in Washington, D.C. Each of the passengers had fluffy black-and-white fur and weighed more than 100 pounds. The passengers were two giant pandas--Mei Xiang and Tian Tian.
Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more.""
The map shows China, the most populated country in the world. More than 1.2 billion people live within China's 3.7 million square miles.
The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called
. From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years.
Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China.
About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive.
The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes.
There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California.
One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999.
Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda.
Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive.
Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said.
As pandas and the people of China compete for the same resources, both face an uncertain future.

337,"Preserving the Past: Saving the Mummies of the Ibaloi
High up in a dense, lush bamboo forest in the Philippines, scientists hike up a steep and narrow trail. (The Philippines is an island country in South-east Asia.)
As the scientists climb higher, they watch out for mud slides and rock falls. Finally, they emerge from under the forest's dripping leaves to face a forbidding black rock. As their eyes adjust to the light, they can see a small, narrow cave near the base of the rock.
Inside that cave, and numerous other nearby caves, is a national treasure. The treasure is not made of gold and silver, however, but of flesh and bone.
The treasure is actually dozens of mummies, some as old as 1,000 years. The Ibaloi people placed the mummies in the caves.
The mummies are the remains of some of the Ibaloi leaders and their families. The descendants of the mummies still live in the Philippines.
The mummies are located in an area called Kabayan in the Cordillera Central mountains. As many as 200 mummies may be located in 50 caves in the mountainous area.
The mummies are important because they tell scientists about past life in the Philippines. The mummies are also
, which means they are important to the religion of the Ibaloi.
Scientists from the National Museum of Manila in the Philippines are scrambling to find and protect all the mummies. The scientists worry that logging, forest fires, farming, or vandals may damage the mummies.
To protect the mummies, the Philippine government is putting up gates in front of the caves. Guards and tour guides are being hired to show people the mummies and to keep vandals away.
According to museum scientists, it took as much as one year to prepare an Ibaloi mummy. The process started when an Ibaloi tribal leader or family member who was near death drank a very salty liquid called
. The brine helped preserve the body.
The body was then strapped to a chair and placed over a low fire, as well as left in the sun to dry, for up to one year. Over time, the body would shrink. The body was then folded and placed in a coffin carved from a pine tree.

Wildfire damage has hit a 10 year high. More than 6 million acres of U.S. forests and grasslands have gone up in smoke so far. Thats nearly double the area that burns in an average year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
Emergency resources have been pushed to the limit. ""Weve been pretty busy this fire season,"" fire information officer Russ Rivera told
National fire officials have responded to the increase in wildfires. More than 10,000 workers are fighting flames across the country. Military units and firefighters from Canada, New Zealand, and Australia have come to the United States to help
Western states, including Oregon, California, Nevada, and Wyoming, have been most affected. Firefighters have been battling a tough blaze in Washington state for weeks. Lightning
or started, the fire. At least 80,000 acres of national and state forest have burned. Officials dont expect the fire to be brought under control until early October.
Wildfire season typically begins in June and lasts into November. This years season heated up early with a series of grass fires that blazed through Oklahoma and Texas in January. Those fires were tough to slow down. ""Youre talking about really fastmoving fires,"" Rivera says. ""Faster than you can run.""

142,"Wind can help fly a kite, power a sailboat, or spread seeds. Around the world, wind has also become an increasingly popular and inexpensive source of energy that is converted into electricity.
At the National Wind Technology Center in Colorado, scientists are working to advance wind-power technology. Wind is often considered an environmentally friendly source of power. Wind doesn't pollute the environment and is a renewable source of energy that can't be used up like
, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.
Harnessing power from wind is nothing new. Some of the first windmills were used in Europe more than 5,000 years ago. Today, modern windmills, called
, resemble airplane propellers and are grouped together in wind farms.
Despite the benefits, wind power is far from perfect. Opponents of wind farms say the biggest problem is unreliabilitywhen the wind doesn't blow, there is no power. They also argue that wind turbines can be an eyesore and threaten birds and other wildlife that fly into the blades.
Currently, 27 states have wind farms. Those turbines provide enough power for more than a million homes.

537,"Scientists learn how Australia's marsupials see color.
The young kangaroo will stay in its mother's pouch for about nine months.
Suspected that color was very important to Australia's honey possums. The tiny possums would always scurry to the brightest orange flowers to dine on their
That is the sweet liquid that flowers produce.
Until recently, most scientists thought the tree-dwelling possums had poor color vision because they are
animals. A nocturnal animal sleeps during the day and is active at night.
""I noticed that possums were very active during the day, which I had not expected,"" Arrese told
. ""I also noticed that the possums never made a mistake when searching out the sweet nectar from certain brightly colored flowers.""
To test her idea, Arrese did experiments with honey possums, tiny mouselike creatures called dunnarts, and other
What she discovered amazed scientists. Marsupials can see in color, just like humans.
is the name given to the group of mammals that includes possums, koalas, kangaroos, and Tasmanian devils. A

A koala spends most of its day hanging out in eucalpytus trees and dining on their yummy leaves.
or types, of marsupials. Most live in Australia and its nearby islands.
How exactly do these marsupials see? Color vision depends on
. Cones are tiny cells in the
that react to light. The retina is the lining in the back of the eye. It connects to the brain.
Marsupials have three types of cones in their eyes. Most mammals, including dogs and horses, have only two types of cone cells. That leaves them unable to see blues or reds.
Australia is home to most marsupials. This continent is often called the ""land down under."" That is because it lies in the Southern Hemispherethe half of Earth below the equator. Much of central Australia is desert. The Australian desert is called the outback, because it is so remote. More than 90 percent of the Australian population lives along the coast.
such as humans and apes, also have two types of cones. However, one cone is a special type that allows them to see a wide range of colors. (Check out ""How Do We See?"" to learn how the human eye works.)
Thanks to light, you can see. Light
, or bounces, off objects and travels to your eyes. Light enters the eye through the
. The pupil is the black circle in the middle of the eye.
After entering the pupil, light passes through the
. The lens focuses light on light-sensitive cells in the
, forming an upside-down image. The retina has two types of light-sensitive cells.
The retina turns the light image into electrical signals. Those signals travel to the brain through the
. The brain then turns the image right side up.
Arrese's findings show that some marsupials, like the possum and the dunnart, can see even
. That means they have stronger vision than humans! Ultraviolet light comes from the sun and is invisible to the human eye. It is the kind of light that causes tans and sunburns.
Thanks to Arrese's most recent discovery, scientists hope to learn more about mammals' eyesight. ""Before my findings, scientists were firmly convinced that among mammals, only primates, including humans, could see a full range of colors,"" she says.
In addition, her research has put the spotlight on the pouch-bearing creatures. Scientists will use the latest research to learn more about marsupials. ""For a long time, marsupials were considered not as interesting as other mammals,"" says Arrese. ""Now all that has changed.""

561,"A teenager's science project reveals long hours of video game playing could cause pain in your thumbs.
Have you ever gotten a blister or a tingling feeling on your thumb after playing video games? Then you may have ""PlayStation thumb.""
Thirteen-year-old Safura Abdool Karim's research on this condition was published in South Africa's main medical journal. Safura became the youngest author to publish an article in that journal.
According to Safura's research, the medical condition results from playing hours of video games.
, or signs, of ""PlayStation thumb"" include pain, numbness, tingling, and blistersmainly in the thumbs.
As part of her science project, Safura surveyed 120 students at school. She asked kids in grades 4 through 7 how oftenand for how longthey played video games. She also asked students whether they had any pain or swelling in their thumbs.
Her survey showed that 28 of the 60 boys and 17 of the 60 girls played regularly. Eight boys and seven girls complained of redness, tingling, and blisters.
Safura doesn't spend a lot of time playing video games. In fact, she doesn't own a video game system and has only played three times in her life. She calls video games ""a waste of time.""
A career in medicine could be in the teen's future. Both of her parents are doctors. She plans to become a
or children's doctor, and work with sick children in Africa.

664,"Kids who live in the United States are changing, according to the U.S. census. Sure, kids are getting taller, stronger, and faster as they grow up. But they are changing in another way, too--U.S. kids are more
, or different in background, than ever before.
The graph shows percentages of people living in the U.S. from some ethnic groups. The figures add up to more than 100% because some people said they were from more than one ethnic group and were counted more than once.
Every ten years, the U.S. government counts all the people who live in the United States. The count is called the
. Recently, the government began releasing some of the information it learned from the 2000 census.
The census counted 281.4 million people in the United States. More than 72 million of those people are kids under age 18. That means that about 26 out of every 100 people are kids!
The census also showed that U.S. kids are more
diverse than ever before. That means that today's kids have ancestors who came from a greater variety of foreign countries. ""The nation is more diverse in the year 2000 than it was in 1990, when the last census was taken,"" said Jorge del Pinal of the U.S. Census Bureau.
, or people who are not part of the largest ethnic group, increased from 24 percent to 31 percent of the total U.S. population. Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country.
Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group.
Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe.

794,"'s fifth annual backpack survey shows that fourth graders are, on average, lugging around more weight than last year.
This year's survey shows that fourth graders are carrying an average 7.9 pounds in their school backpacks. Last year's survey revealed that fourth graders lugged an average 7.5 pounds in their packs.
This year's backpack survey uncovered some shocking backpack weights. Some kids are carrying up to 25 pounds in their packs. One kid said he carried 63 pounds in his knapsack!
Doctors say that today more kids than ever before are complaining of back problems. Some of those back problems are caused by overloaded backpacks. Doctors say kids should not carry backpacks heavier than 10 to 15 percent of their body weight. A 70-pound fourth grader, for example, should not carry a pack that weighs more than 7 to 10.5 pounds. According to the survey, most fourth graders are within that range.

555,"Dodging Danger: Should Dodgeball Be Tossed Out of School?
For many kids, dodgeball is a harmless game. But gym teacher Neil Williams does not see anything ""harmless"" about the game.
Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital.
Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game.
The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told
Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told
the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes.""
Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association.
Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said.
Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit.""
Here's what some kids have to say about dodgeball:
Isabela, age 11: A dodgeball isn't hard and it can't hurt anyone.
Paloma, age 9: I like dodgeball. You get to run around a lot and that's a lot of fun.
Liliam, age 9: Dodgeball is great because you get to throw the ball at other kids.
Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it.

695,"Nose to the Grindstone: Did their special noses protect search-and-rescue dogs after 9/11?
On September 11, 2001, help was needed immediately. Terrorists had crashed airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City, New York, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Police officers and firefighters weren't the only ones to respond. More than 200 search-and-rescue dogs used their noses to help find victims.
Deja Vu, a German shepherd from Pennsylvania, hunted through piles of
or wreckage, looking for survivors. The air was filled with harmful dust and smoke, but Deja Vu and the other dogs didn't wear protective masks. They needed their noses clear because they rely on their powerful sense of smell to find people. (See ""
A rescue dog named Billy helps an emergency worker search for survivors at the site of the World Trade Center collapse
or dangerous, air at the World Trade Center and Pentagon sites would make the dogs sick. ""The environment was so awful, I couldn't imagine they wouldn't have problems,"" Otto told
So she organized a study to track the dogs' health.
Today, more than five years later, Otto has surprising results: Many of the dogs are fine. In fact, the dogs in her study are just as healthy as other search-andrescue dogs not involved in the 9/11 recovery efforts.
Deja Vu is no exception. ""We were concerned [about] what the dogs were inhaling and walking through,"" Deja Vu's handler, Pat Thompson, told
""But Deja Vu has remained in good health.""
The study results are surprising because thousands of people who volunteered at the disaster site now have
or breathing, problems. Scientists say the workers must have breathed in dangerous particles from the collapsed buildings.
The search-and-rescue dogs' noses might have protected them from the bad air, Otto
or guesses. A dog's nose, which is longer than a human's nose, can better filter air and keep harmful particles from reaching its lungs.
sometimes reacts differently than a human's immune system does. That system protects the body against diseases and infections. For example, respiratory problems such as asthma are unusual in dogs. Otto and other researchers say that may be why the search-and-rescue dogs haven't developed any breathing disorders.
The scientists also think the dogs in the study may be healthier than the people who worked at the sites because most of the canines spent less time at the disaster sites than their two-legged counterparts. Many rescue workers who developed breathing problems spent months volunteering after the attacks. The dogs in Otto's study spent an average of 10 days helping.
Scientists may never pinpoint the exact reason that most of the dogs in Otto's study are in good health. But Otto hopes to continue the study for as long as the dogs live. She wants to stay on the lookout for any health problems that may develop over the next few years.
She plans to use the information she gathers to protect search-andrescue dogs on future disaster missions. ""No piece of equipment can ever do the job that these dogs do,"" Otto told
Each human has a unique scent, like a fingerprint. That scent comes from a mixture of sweat and tiny flakes of skin, called
which people continually shed. Shampoo, deodorant, perfume, and clothing can also affect a person's scent.
Search-and-rescue dogs are trained to pick up a person's scent from the air. Their noses are powerful enough to smell people who are underground or even underwater. The dogs are so
or good at what they do, that a single searchand- rescue canine team is equal to about 20 human searchers, according to the National Search and Rescue Dog Association.
What are some other ways in which dogs protect people?

503,"In 1899, Charles Duell, the head of the U.S. Patent Office, reportedly said, ""Everything that can be invented has been invented.""
He obviously wasn't aware of what was flying around in the minds of Orville and Wilbur Wright. The brothers-bicycle makers from Dayton, Ohio-dreamed of building the world's first flying machine.
Just four years later, on a bitterly cold December day, the Wright brothers succeeded-and changed the world forever. On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright made the first successful airplane flight on a windy beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
, the brothers' plane flew 120 feet. That is less than half the length of a football field.
Although the flight lasted only 12 seconds, it steered the course of history in a new direction. The brothers launched the age of flight, or
Orville and Wilbur Wright took to the sky three more times that historic day. Wilbur completed the longest flight, which lasted 59 seconds. He flew a distance of 852 feet-nearly the length of three football fields.
Today, visitors can get a close-up look at the
. It is on exhibit at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
, or 100th anniversary, of the Wright brothers' famous flight. Other historic planes from the past century, such as the
, or honoring, the 100th anniversary. Festivals, flight shows, museum exhibits, and reenactments of the Wrights' original flight are being held.
Schoolchildren in the Wright brothers' hometown of Dayton, Ohio, recently celebrated the anniversary. They helped build a
, or copy, of the first plane.
It was tested at Kitty Hawk. Other flight fans have built replicas that will be flown at Kitty Hawk on December 17.
The Wright brothers' courage and innovation inspired a hundred years of amazing achievements in the sky. Today, jumbo jets crisscross oceans daily.
Powered flight has connected all parts of the world, changing the way people travel and conduct business. The U.S. military uses planes to fight wars. The government employs aircraft to track weather patterns. The Wright brothers' invention has even led humans to soar beyond the clouds and into space.
""The airplane has defined our world for 100 years, and we should keep in mind that it was only 66 years after the day of the
that man walked on the moon,"" said Air and Space Museum director J. R. Dailey.
The Wright brothers' courage and inventiveness ushered in the first century of flight. Here are some flight highlights from the past hundred years.
The Wright brothers successfully fly the world's first powered airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
Charles Lindbergh makes the first solo, nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the
Amelia Earhart becomes the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1937, she vanishes without a trace over the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to fly around the world.
the first plane to fly faster than the speed of sound.
Buzz Aldrin is the second man on the moon. With ""one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind,"" Neil Armstrong becomes the first human to walk on the moon.
The Concorde, the world's only supersonic passenger jet, begins service. The fleet, which flies faster than the speed of sound, is grounded this October because it is too expensive to run.
Humans get a place in space. This year marks the third anniversary of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station.
Where do you think the next century of flight will take us? Why?

304,"WR Talks to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
Weekly Reader sat down with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice the day after Iraq announced its draft constitution. Weeks later, Iraqis voted to approve the constitution. Earlier this year, Rice became the first African American woman secretary of state. She is the highest-ranking member of President George W. Bushs Cabinet, or group of close advisers. As secretary of state, Rice advises the president on foreign affairs and works with world leaders on important issues. WR talked to her about Iraq and her job as head of the State Department.
WR: When Iraq announced its draft constitution yesterday, what role did the State Department play?
We were following the Iraqi constitution very closely. It started with a phone call to our ambassador in Baghdad, and then I talked to [President Bush] about what was going on. I probably was on the phone to Baghdad yesterday six or seven times just following what was going on and seeing if there was anything that we could do back here.
WR: Some people say its a mistake to try to build a democracy in Iraq. How do you respond to critics?
I say shame on anybody who says that people ought to live in
. [That is a type of government ruled by someone unjustly. Rice is referring to Iraqi life under former ruler Saddam Hussein.] When are we going to learn that human beings want to be free? And its not as if theres a choice in between. You either are free or youre not. And the people of Iraq are now free.
WR: Youve traveled more than any other secretary of state in your first six months in office. Did a particular experience stand out for you?
I went to Phuket in Thailand, where the tsunami had taken place. And there were all of these American college students there helping out in the schools. And it reminded me whats really great about Americans.
WR: What is a typical day like for you?
I usually get up about 4:30, and I exercise first. I get into the office about 6:30. I read the newspaper before I leave home, but [my staff] prepares for me reports from around the world. International politics is a 24-hour schedule, because while were asleep, the rest of the world is awake. ... My day [may include] meeting with foreign ministers. I go over to the White House for meetings at least three or four times a week. I talk to the president pretty much every day.
WR: Youve repeatedly said that you dont want to run for president in 2008. Why dont you want the nations top job?
(laughs) I do have a lot of respect for people who run for office. But I think you have to have a kind of fire to want to do that, and I justI dont.
WR: What did you want to be growing up?
I wanted to be a concert pianist. I could read music from the time I was 3 1/2 years old, and so I studied really hard. I still play [today].
WR: As a child, did you believe you could be anything you wanted?
I did. Even though I was growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, at the time when it was segregated, my parents never let me think that there was anything I couldnt do.
WR: You like football. Is your dream still to be commissioner of the National Football League (NFL)?
Well, yes. Now, if the NFL commissioners job comes up sometime soon, then the president and I are going to have to talk.

803,"Dan Shaw and Cuddles are an endless source of fascination for onlookers when they're out in public. That's because Cuddles is a miniature guide horse. Shaw, who is blind, said he felt like Cuddles from a television program. Shaw and his wife contacted the Guide Horse foundation in Kittrell, North Carolina. ""Horses make excellent guides,"" said trainer Janet Burleson. ""It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it' guide.""
Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn't sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn.
Shaw says that everyone wants to pet Cuddles because the tiny horse is so cute. But people should not pet Cuddles or any other service animal. Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City.

591,"Families welcome back soldiers as the war in Iraq continues.
For the last year, 10-year-old Holli Hill communicated with her dad over a webcam. ""I told him I lost a bunch of teeth and I loved him and missed him,"" Holli told
Her dad, U.S. Army Sergeant Douglas Hill, left for Iraq last August. Now hes back at home.
Hill is one of 20,000 troops returning home after being sent to fight in the ongoing Iraq war. ""I just couldnt wait to see my family,"" says Hill. His wife and five children were waiting to welcome him home to Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
Fort Campbell has the thirdlargest military population in the Army. Nearly 10,000 military family members live on the base, which houses five elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high school. For the past year, almost every student at those schools had a family member serving in Iraq.
Holli Hill, 10, welcomes her ather home from Iraq at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
It has been a tough year for Fort Campbell families. Since last August, 169 of the bases soldiers have been killed. This was the second time Hill had been sent to Iraq. Army officials have yet to say when or where Fort Campbells troops will be
The United States began sending troops to Iraq during the U.S.-led invasion in March of 2003. At the time, some countries feared that Iraqs
Saddam Hussein, had weapons of mass destruction. (A dictator is someone who has complete control of a country and often rules it unjustly.) Those weapons were never found.
Fighting has increased between Iraqs Sunni and Shiite religious groups. Shiites make up the majority of Iraqs population, but they were treated poorly under Saddams Sunni-led government.
More than 140,000 U.S. military personnel are
or placed, in Iraq. Along with troops from other countries, they are working to bring peace and stability to Iraq.
Since the war began, more than 2,600 U.S. troops have been killed. Nearly 20,000 U.S. troops have been wounded. Iraqi deaths caused by the war are estimated at 45,000. The war has cost the United States more than $300 billion so far.
In recent months, U.S. support for the war has dropped. A CNN poll from August showed that 60 percent of Americans are against the war.
Some lawmakers are calling for U.S. troops to come home permanently. ""Our troops cannot be there indefinitely,"" U.S. Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut told reporters. Shays and other lawmakers have called for a
or schedule, for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.
President George W. Bush and others warn that pulling troops out would be dangerous for the United States. ""If we retreat before the job is done, this nation will become even more in jeopardy,"" said Bush.
Though Fort Campbells troops may be sent back to Iraq in the future, the bases families can breathe a sigh of relief for now. ""There are no words to describe how happy I am,"" says Hollis mom, Kristine Hill.
168,754 square miles (about the size of California)
About 95 percent of Iraqis are Muslims. They practice the religion of Islam. About 60 percent of those Muslims are Shiites, and 35 percent are Sunnis. The two groups are struggling for power in Iraq.
Compare and contrast how the war in Iraq affects military and nonmilitary families.

8,"Will new fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border help stop illegal immigration?
President George W. Bush and many members of the U.S. Congress think so. On October 26, Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 into law. The law will allow the building of 700 miles of new fencing along the 2,100-mile border between the United States and Mexico.
The fence is designed to keep people from entering the United States without permission. About 6 million illegal immigrants from Mexico live in the United States today. An
is someone who leaves one country to live in another country. If people enter a country without permission, they are called illegal immigrants.
Most illegal immigrants leave Mexico to find jobs in the United States. They usually cant find jobs in Mexico that pay as much as those in the United States do.
Some Americans say illegal immigrants take away jobs from U.S. citizens. Others say, however, that illegal immigrants help the U.S. economy by doing jobs that many Americans dont want.
The signing of the bill led to great anger in Mexico. Mexican officials say a fence would not stop illegal immigration and would be an insult to Mexico. Mexican President-elect Felipe Caldern pledged to challenge the fence at the United Nations. Bush, however, called the fence ""an important step in our nations efforts to secure our borders.""

263,"When Hannah Kristan was 8 years old, she had a dream. She wanted to play on a playground with her friends. Now, four years later, her dream has become a reality.
Hannah, who lives in New Haven, Connecticut, has a disease called spina bifida. Because of the disease, she cannot walk. Kids in wheelchairs can't use most regular playground equipment.
Hannah worked hard to make her dream come true. She talked to New Haven's mayor about her dream. The mayor helped her raise $200,000 to pay for the special playground.
In September, Hannah's park, called Hannah's Dream, opened. At the opening ceremony, New Haven's mayor told people, ""Whenever you need a lift in life about whether something is possible to do, think of this place, Hannah's Dream.""
Hannah was overjoyed that her dream had been realized. She told the crowd at the opening, ""I hope you can all see me, because I'm not really here. I'm really on cloud nine.""

732,"Now you can take a trip to Mars without ever leaving Earth.
A kid reporter journeyed to Mars aboard Disney's new space ride. Find out how close her ride was to the real thing.
kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars.
Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.
After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future.
On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan.
Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum.
Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer.
Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role.
After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes.
The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said.
So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question.
Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said.
Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle.
However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of
. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth.
The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity.
For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are.""
Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned.
Imagineers are people who work for Disney.
In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories.
What was your role in creating the ride?
I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride.
Where did your team get the inspiration for Mission: SPACE?
People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before.
Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things?
That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all.
How many times have you been on Mission: SPACE?
At last count, I've ridden it more than 400 times!

640,"Construction workers in Rome, Italy, recently dug up the ruins of an ancient poet's house. While digging a trash dump, the workers discovered the house that belonged to Ovid, a poet who lived about 2,000 years ago.
, located on the banks of the Tiber River. Many of his poems and letters are about his villa. Just as Ovid was becoming a great poet, he offended the emperor of Rome and was forced to leave his beloved villa for a distant city. While he was away, he wrote nostalgic letters about his home.
Scientists are amazed by the discovery. ""By itself, the villa is a notable finding, but it acquires even more value because it is the place where one of the greatest poets in Rome lived,"" explained Gaetano Messineo, one of the scientists at the dig.
City officials in Rome plan to put up a building around Ovid's ancient villa to protect it. But the area will not look as it did in Ovid's time. A dump and a four-lane highway now block the views of the Tiber River that Ovid wrote about in his poetry.

799,"The United Nations has a new leader. Ban Ki-moon, 62, was South Koreas foreign minister before becoming U.N. secretary-general. He will begin his fiveyear term in office on January 1, 2007. Ban replaces Kofi Annan, who has been secretary-general for the last 10 years.
The United Nations was set up in 1945 shortly after the end of World War II (1939-1945). Its main purpose is to help countries work for world peace.
Currently 192 countries belong to the United Nations. Their representatives in the U.N. General Assembly try to solve world problems, such as hunger and disease.
At the heart of the United Nations is the Security Council. The Security Council is a group of selected member countries. It makes decisions on behalf of the entire United Nations when there is a world
or major problem. It is the job of the secretary-general to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
Ban takes office at a time of tough challenges for the United Nations. Wars and conflicts rage across Africa and the Middle East. About 90,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops will be stationed around the world under Bans command.
In his first speech to the General Assembly after being chosen secretary-general, Ban said, ""The true measure of success for the U.N. is not how much we promise but how much we deliver for those who need us most.""

239,"Students in Piscataway, New Jersey, have something many kids only dream of-- a rule that limits the amount of homework they are assigned.
Last October, the Piscataway Board of Education voted to limit the amount of homework kids get. For kids in elementary school, homework is limited to 30 minutes a weeknight. For kids in high school, the amount of homework is limited to two hours a weeknight.
In recent years, many U.S. parents have called for limits on the amount of assigned homework.
Those parents have argued that heavy loads of homework leave kids little time for other activities. In addition, some parents say that homework assignments are so tough that they have to hire tutors to help their kids with homework.
Before the school board in Piscataway acted, parents there had been concerned about the amount of homework assigned by teachers. ""[Kids] are in school for six-and-a-half hours a day,"" said parent Cheryl Weaver. ""They don't need to come home and do another two or three hours of homework. That's more than a full-time job.""
Many educators worry about cutting down on homework. They say that limiting homework could mean limiting learning.
Some educators say that even a light load of homework helps kids learn and do well in school. The Educational Resources Information Center the of U.S. Department of Education has released a report about homework and its impact on students.
Many companies across the United States have developed Web sites aimed at helping kids with their homework. Many of those Web companies hire teachers to help kids come up with the answers to questions. Here are two such sites.
According to the department's report, homework helps students in many ways. For example, homework helps students become interested in different subjects, teaches them responsibility, and improves their classroom work. In short, homework helps students do better in school and get better grades.
Some students agree with the experts. New York resident Kaitlin Ofman, 12, notes that although she sometimes has a lot of homework, she still feels that there is a benefit to doing it.
""I understand that homework is important,"" Kaitlin said. ""After we learn something in school, we might forget it if we [didn't] have any practice in it,"" she said.

536,"Some dogs are taking part in a fun pet project helping kids read! Every Tuesday, a golden retriever named Tucker and an Irish setter named Ross visit students at Washington Grove Elementary. The students at the school in Gaithersburg, Maryland, take turns reading one-on-one with the dogs. Each student spends about 30 minutes sharing a book with a dog and its handler.
The visits are part of a nationwide program called Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.). The program sends dogs and their owners to schools, libraries, and other sites to help kids become better readers. More than 750 dogs in 45 states take part in the program.
The read-aloud sessions help kids gain more confidence as they read. Kids know that if they make a mistake, their furry friends are not going to make fun of them.
Their canine friends play an active part too, listening closely and using their noses to help turn the pages. One dog even chooses the books by putting its nose on the story it wants to hear!
Sometimes dogs end up snoozing, but their reading partners dont usually mind. Sixth grader Dominick Harper from Kentucky reads to a Labrador retriever named Shyanne. When Shyanne closes her eyes, Dominick says, ""shes just taking in the words.""

448,"Believe it or not, this is no April Fools' joke. Snakes and frogs don't have to look both ways when they cross LaRue Road in southern Illinois.
Each year, this government road closes to traffic so that these creatures--and just about anything else that crawls--can safely cross without getting squashed. The U.S. Forest Service closes the road twice a year--from March 15 to May 15 and then again in the fall.
Why have officials been shutting down the road for the past 30 years? An unusually high number of reptiles and amphibians cross the road during these times of the year.
, or moving from one location to another. In spring, snakes and frogs are making their way from their winter dens to swamps where they will live for the summer.
State reptile expert Scott Ballard says that the area is home to 102

that this year's festival celebrates the history of kites in different cultures.
is the way of life, ideas, and traditions of a group of people.
At the event, people will find kite displays, demonstrations, and even a handmade kite competition. Mike Van Meers chose to make a Japanese fighter kite for the festival. ""Kites come in all shapes and sizes,"" he told
""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""

776,"George W. Bush and John Kerry want to help senior citizens get good health care.
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
The costs of health care and prescription drugs in the United States keep rising. Many Americans can't afford health insurance, which covers some medical costs when people are sick. Both candidates want to make sure that all Americans, including children, get affordable, high-quality health care.
President Bush says that Americans should be able to choose health care plans that meet their needs at prices they can afford. He also wants health insurance to pay for tests for cancer, diabetes, and other diseases. In December 2003, Bush signed a law to help senior citizens get the expensive medicines they need and choose the doctors they want.
Senator Kerry also wants to make sure that all Americans get good health care at prices they can afford. He plans to work to lower the costs of health insurance and prescription drugs, which he says are too high under President Bush. He wants to make sure that the government helps senior citizens and

749,"Cheer for heroes! On November 11, people across the United States will celebrate
on Veterans Day. A veteran is a person who served in the military.
There are more than 20 million veterans in the United States. The government holds a ceremony every year to honor them. That event is on Veterans Day. It is in Arlington, Virginia. The ceremony includes speeches from military officials.
Many cities also have parades on Veterans Day. The events often include fireworks. The city of Montgomery, Alabama, will hold a concert this year, says Bob Horton. He works for the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs.
Horton says taking part in Veterans Day activities is important. We have the opportunity to honor the men and women who have served in the military, he told
and to thank them for [protecting our] freedoms.

Woolly mammoths were huge, elephant-like animals that lived during the
That was a period of time that started almost 2 million years ago and ended about 11,000 years ago. During the Ice Age, snow and ice covered much of Earth.
The 220-pound woolly mammoth skull was not easy to unearth. ""It is such a spectacular, huge thing,"" said Hollingworth. ""It took seven hours to carefully dig out and needed four of us to carry it.""
Scientists were very excited about the find. This was only the second time a woolly mammoth skull has been discovered in England. By studying the skull, scientists hope to learn more about these Ice Age creatures.

443,"Professional golfer Casey Martin has taken his case to the United States Supreme Court.
Martin is suing the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) for the right to use a golf cart during PGA tournaments.
Martin has a rare blood disease that makes it painful for him to walk. Martin says he must use a cart to play golf.
The PGA argues that a cart gives Martin an advantage over other golfers. Unless Martin plays without using a cart, he cannot play in tournaments, PGA officials say.
The Supreme Court may rule on the case sometime this summer.

691,"Students log miles to arm themselves against health risks.
A year ago, Khalil Colon, 9, said running made him feel like he was ""about to drop on the middle of the floor."" Today, running is a breeze for him. ""Now I can run 20 laps and I'm not even tired,"" he says.
Khalil participates in the Mighty Milers program. That is a running program that helps kids become fit. His school in New York City is one of more than 100 schools in his state to take part in the program. Students run at least half a
, several days a week. A mile is 5,280 feet. Students earn prizes and medals depending on how many miles they complete.
The goal of Mighty Milers is to reduce childhood
. That is the condition of being very overweight. Mighty Milers challenges elementary school kids to run or walk up to four
during the school year. A marathon is a race that is 26.2 miles. That is more than 138,000 feet!
Not exercising enough can lead to weight gain if a person takes in more
than he or she burns. A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy in food. Being overweight can lead to health problems, such as heart disease.
Program director Cliff Sperber says Mighty Milers is trying to improve children's health. ""Kids take pride in the fact that they're running,"" he told
The young runners agree. Just ask Katherine Rojas, 9. She is the fastest runner in her class in New York City. ""[Running] makes me feel good about myself,"" she says. ""And it helps you get muscles.""
Running may be an individual sport, but its a team effort for the leg muscles. Study the diagram to learn which lower-body muscles runners rely on to
Most of the leg muscles push the leg forward. When the foot pushes off the ground, the lower leg creates energy so runners can run fast.

692,"For centuries, people have told stories about the lost island of Atlantis. It is said that the people of Atlantis were very wealthy and that the ancient island gleamed with gold and silver. Then one day, the stories go, the island suddenly sank to the ocean floor.
? A myth is an old, made-up story. One team of explorers believe Atlantis is real. They claim to have found the remains of the lost island.
Scientists believe that they have found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
The explorers say the remains are on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, buried under sediment. (See the map.) ""We hope that future expeditions will be able to uncover the sediment and bring back physical proof,"" said one explorer.
Other experts are unsure whether the remains are those of Atlantis. This is not the first time people have believed they had found the lost island. Until someone is able to prove it, the mystery will continue.

246,"A U.S. veteran receives a special medal for bravery.
On Sept. 8, 2009, Dakota Meyer faced the biggest decision of his life. Enemy fighters were attacking his fellow troops in Afghanistan. That is a country in Asia. Meyer could follow orders and stay away from the fighting. Or he could risk his life and head straight into the battle.
The choice was simple, Meyer says. He raced into the heavy gunfire. Its your family, your brothers, your Marines [out there], he explains. Meyer made five trips to bring people to safety. He saved 36 U.S. and Afghan troops that day.
U.S. President Barack Obama recently awarded Meyer the Medal of Honor. That is the U.S. militarys highest award. It rewards troops for
, or bravery. Meyer was the first living Marine to receive the honor in nearly 40 years.
Dakota Meyer receives the Medal of Honor from U.S. President Barack Obama.
U.S. troops have been at war in Afghanistan for 10 years. They are fighting the Taliban (TAH-li-bahn). That group supported the people who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The attacks killed thousands of Americans.
Meyer says his medal belongs to all Marines. He hopes Americans honor them and other U.S. troops on
Day. A veteran is a former member of the military. Veterans Day is November 11.
Every day while we are standing here free, its because those guys are
[or giving up] so much, he says.

546,"""Hee, hee, hee. Ha, ha, ha."" People have all different kinds of laughs. No matter how you laugh, the result is the same. Laughing makes people feel good.
A new study finds that simply looking forward to a laugh is good for you. Knowing you have a funny event planned reduces stress, scientists say. They also add that looking forward to a laugh helps your body fight disease.

629,"Scientists discover the remains of a mini flying animal in China.
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a ... tiny flying
? Scientists recently discovered the fossil of a sparrow-sized creature in China. A reptile is an animal that crawls or slithers, has scales or bony plates, and lays eggs. The fossil is a
(TER-uh-sor). Pterosaurs were flying reptiles that had wings made of skin. It was also a pterodactyl (ter-uh-DAK-tuhl). A pterodactyl is an
type of pterosaur that lived millions of years ago. To be extinct means to have died out completely.
(nem-i-coh-LOP-ter-uss CRIP-ti-cuss). It is little, but it may set a big record. Scientists say it is the smallest toothless pterosaur ever found!
. A wingspan is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The reptile also had a sharp, pointy beak and curved, birdlike claws.
The reptile's small size may have had advantages. Scientists say being small may have allowed
to hide from animals that eat other animals. Its size may have also helped it find food. Because it was small, the reptile could ""be [quicker] to catch insects,"" scientist Xiaolin Wang told
. Wang was on the team that discovered the pterosaur.
Scientists plan to study the reptile's fossil in more detail. They hope it will offer clues about how pterosaurs changed over time. ""They are ancestors of the large pterosaurs,"" Wang says.
Pterosaurs ranged in size from as small as a bird to as big as an airplane. Here are three different kinds of pterosaurs.
This pterosaur's wingspan was about 4 feet. It also had a huge head, and its legs could stretch out.
This pterosaur was about 6 feet long with a wingspan of 20 to 25 feet.
This is the largest pterosaur ever found. Its wingspan was about 40 feet. It also had a long, thin beak.
Why might scientists want to study pterosaurs?

734,"Scientists recently discovered the tusks and bones of a mastodon in Milia, Greece. The mastodon was an early kind of hairy elephant. Mastodons became
in Europe about 2 million years ago. Extinct means having died out completely. The tusks are the largest of their kind ever found. They are 15 and 16 feet long! Scientists also uncovered the animal's leg and parts of its jaw. Many of the bones were in good condition. The jaw still had teeth. Scientists hope to study the tusks and bones to better understand the mastodon. They also hope to learn more about the time the animal roamed.

353,"How did Ruby Bridges make history 50 years ago?
Fifty years ago, a little girl named Ruby Bridges arrived at her new elementary school. The school was in New Orleans, Louisiana.
As she walked toward the schools front doors, an angry crowd of people shouted at her. United States
walked with her. A marshal is an officer. They were there to protect the first grader. Thats because the people didnt want Ruby to go inside. But the 6-year-old walked into the school anyway. As she did, she marched into history books.
Ruby Bridges started first grade in 1960.
The day was Nov. 14, 1960. On that morning, little Ruby became one of the first African Americans to attend an all-white elementary school in the South.
Before then, the law in many states said that black children could not attend the same schools as white children. People of different races also had to use separate public restrooms. It was called
That is when people of different races are kept separate.
U.S. leaders worked to end segregation. They helped bring
to all Americans. Those are the rights to be treated equally. A few months before Ruby started school, a federal court ordered an end to school segregation in New Orleans.
By the time Ruby started the second grade, there were no more angry people outside her school. There were other African American students in her class. Today, children of all races go to school together.
Bridges says she was never scared to go to school during the first grade. I wasnt really afraid, she told
I didnt really know what was going on at the time, and I loved school.
student reporter Kaelin Ray recently asked Ruby Bridges how it feels to make a difference.
Kaelin Ray: What was your first day at the school like?
My first day I spent sitting in the principals office, so it was very confusing.
KR: How does it feel to know that you are a part of U.S. history?
Im [very] proud of that fact. My mother was really happy about me being able to attend that school. My father was more concerned about my safety.
How would the United States be different today if Ruby Bridges had been too scared to go to school? Why?

785,"Wildlife experts have a reason to cheer. A recent report says that the number of bald eagles in Maryland is soaring. In fact, many states are reporting the same good news.
Forty years ago, bald eagles were in danger of disappearing in the United States. Chemicals used for farming were to blame, say experts. Farmers are no longer allowed to use those chemicals. Experts say that is the main reason there are more bald eagles alive today.
""The recovery started slowly and then has increased in leaps and bounds since the 1990s,"" said one scientist. In 1977, only 200 bald eagles lived in Maryland. Today more than 2,000 bald eagles live there!

251,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is on the move. Right now, the bell hangs at Liberty Hall Pavilion. That is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The area around the bell is being rebuilt and improved. Liberty Hall Pavilion is being torn down. The bell will be moved to its new home 200 yards away. It is called Liberty Bell Center.
Although the new site is only a short distance away, the move will be a tricky one. The bell weighs 2,080 pounds. If it is not moved with care, the bell's famous crack could split even more.
A team of experts has been working to protect the bell during its move. Before the move, three tiny sensors will be placed on the bell. The sensors will sound an alarm if there is any damage to the bell's crack. Special paper will be placed under the sensors so they will not scratch the bell.
The Liberty Bell is a symbol of American freedom. The bell was rung to call people together for special events. It rang on July 8, 1776, to gather people for the first reading of the Declaration of Independence. That was signed on July 4, 1776.
The Liberty Bell has a long history. The bell arrived in Pennsylvania in 1752. It cracked soon after. In 1753, people tried to fix the bell twice. Sometime in the 1830s or 1840s, it cracked again! The exact date remains a mystery.
Experts are hopeful the bell's move will be a success. They want people to see the bell-and the crack that made it famous-for years to come.
What are some other American symbols? Why are those symbols important?

119,"Don't let their tiny size fool you. Chipmunks are tougher than they look! Scientists recently learned that relatives of modern-day chipmunks survived the last
. That was a period of time when snow and ice covered much of Earth. The last ice age happened about 18,000 years ago.
Until recently, scientists thought that most small animals escaped the cold by moving south to warmer areas. However, a new study shows that some chipmunks stayed in the north.
During the last ice age, chipmunks lived in areas of forest near the edges of ice sheets. Those areas escaped being covered by ice, say scientists.

223,"Can you guess what has been around for about 13 billion years? It's a planet that scientists recently discovered. If you think that sounds old, you are right. The newly discovered planet is more than twice as old as Earth. In fact, the new discovery is the oldest planet known to exist!
However, don't rush out to try to get a peek at the planet. It is too far away to be seen. Scientists found the planet by using the Hubble Space Telescope. That is a telescope located in space. It takes photos from about 375 miles above Earth.
Scientists say the new discovery is important. It suggests that planets began forming much earlier than experts once thought. ""This means that 13 billion years ago, life could have arisen and then died out,"" said one scientist.

490,"Will manatees survive after removal from Floridas endangered species list?
Some manatees swim in warm waters off the coast of Florida. These playful, plant-eating animals are often called sea cows. They get their name from their large size.
or died out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000.
As a result, Florida recently took the manatee off its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws to protect this creature were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made it illegal to hunt manatees.
As the number of people in Florida grew, however, more manatees died. Many manatees were injured by or killed in boat crashes. Others became tangled in fishing gear.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many scientists worry that the animals will not receive the same protection they once did. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" manatee expert Patrick Rose told
Officials in Florida say manatees will still be protected under the countrys Endangered Species Act. That law protects threatened plants and animals. ""There will be no less protection,"" says wildlife expert Henry Cabbage.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

16,"Erik Weihenmayer likes adventure. He is a scuba diver, biker, runner, sky diver, skier, and mountain climber. He is also blind.
Erik recently became the first blind person to climb the Seven Summits. A
is the top of a mountain. The Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each of the seven continents.
At age 13, a rare eye disease caused Erik to go blind. He started mountain climbing three years later. He is now one of about 100 athletes who have climbed the Seven Summits.
In what ways would your life be different if you were blind? In what ways would it be the same?
In 1995, Erik started climbing the Seven Summits. He was 26 years old at the time. In September, he climbed the seventh summit, Mount Kosciuszko in Australia.
To prepare for the climbs, Erik spent more than 1,000 hours training each year. He walked on a treadmill every day. He also climbed stairs wearing a 100-pound pack on his back.
Erik climbs with the help of a team of climbers. He uses tracking poles to help him feel his way to the top of each mountain. ""I can't use my eyes, so I use my hands and my feet to feel what I'm doing,"" said Erik.
The mountains that Erik climbed are all different. Some are rocky. Others are covered in snow and ice. Although he cannot see, Erik can use his other senses to tell each mountain apart. ""My senses--the feel of the rock, the smell of the earth, the sound of the wind howling--are what make each mountain different and unique for me,"" he said.

356,"Scientists are now debating the future of the Hubble Space Telescope.
The Hubble Space Telescope gives people a window into space. Since 1990, Hubble has taken photos from 380 miles above Earth. ""Hubble's colorful views are a feast for the eyes,"" said one scientist.
Scientists are now debating the future of this telescope. NASA had planned to take Hubble down in 2010.
A new telescope is scheduled for launch in 2011. However, some scientists say its photos will not be as clear as Hubble's. They say Hubble should stay in space longer.
The problem is that Hubble's parts wear out over time. Every few years, astronauts visit Hubble to make repairs. NASA officials say that to keep Hubble working past 2010 would be costly-about 600 million dollars! Many people say that is too much money to spend. What do you think?

694,"Scientists discover hundreds of plant and animal species.
Imagine hiking through a thick, dark forest. As you push your way past the trees, you notice something stir. Suddenly, youre staring into the bright pink eyes of a
(KAY-tee-did). That is a type of grasshopper. Its a kind of katydid that no scientist has ever seen before. The katydid even looks as if it were wearing pink boots!
Thats just what happened recently to a team of scientists. The experts found the katydid and more than 200 other plant and animal species. They uncovered the species in Papua New Guinea. That is a country on an island in the Pacific Ocean. It is near Australia.
Experts found this possum hanging out in a forest.
The researchers were studying the country to learn more about its
That is the variety of plants and animals in an environment. They uncovered many surprises, including 100 new spider species, about 10 plants, and a mouse. The team also found a
or uncommon, bat, several frogs, and about 100 species of ants.
Andrea Lucky is one of the scientists who helped discover the ants. I looked for ants on tree trunks and on leaves, on the ground, [and] in logs, she told
I was blown away by the number of new species that we found.
Experts are trying to learn more about all of Papua New Guineas species so they can protect them. The animals home is in trouble. Loggers are chopping down trees in the country. Some species are also hunted.
Researchers hope to create protected areas. There, logging and hunting would be illegal. That will help the experts save the species they have found while they continue to look for more. It is absolutely incredible how much [there still is] to be discovered, Lucky says.
Heres a closer look at some of the newly discovered species scientists spied in Papua New Guinea.
Meet mighty mouse! This rodent is unlike any other experts have seen before. The mouse has thin feet, sharp teeth, and a long, white-tipped tail.
Scientists found this pretty plant all over the area. Species like this one are often used to decorate homes. With the flowers large white petals, its no wonder.
Researchers got a real kick out of this katydid. If threatened, the grasshopper holds its large, spiny legs above its headto jab you!
Why might scientists want to study countries such as Papua New Guinea?

743,"Scientists are hot on the trail of Native Americans! They are using a high-tech machine to learn how the people traded goods with one another. The scientists are using the machine to study Native American arrowheads and other stone tools.
What makes the scientists' work so special is that the machine does not harm the objects. In the past, scientists had to drill holes or take samples from
. Artifacts are objects made by people in the past.
The machine can tell the scientists what the objects are made of. That can help them learn where the rocks used to make the tools came from. For example, the scientists figured out that tools found in Alaska were made from rocks 300 miles away.
Scientists hope to use the machine to learn more about other ancient cultures. Herb Maschner is one of the scientists leading the research. ""Understanding how cultures [worked together] is key to learning about [their] rise,"" he told

276,"How can two boys who live halfway around the world become friends? Ask Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Ontario, Canada, and Akana Jimmy of Uganda, a country in Africa. A new book shares their story. It is called
Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together.
When Ryan was 6, he learned about the lack of clean drinking water in some parts of the world. Ryan raised money to help build a well in Jimmys village. The two boys became pen pals, then friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to see the well. Four years ago, Ryans family arranged to bring Jimmy to live at their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy told
Ryan has raised more than $1.5 million. The money has helped build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa.

716,"The ice near the North Pole is thawing. That spells trouble for polar bears and other animals.
Polar bears are in danger as the Arctic heats up.
Polar bears spend much of their time on sea ice.
The heat is on for animals living in the Arctic. That is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In a recent report, scientists warn that the Arctic is warming up. They say that in 2005, the Arctic had the smallest amount of ice it has had in more than 100 years.
Polar bears and other animals that depend on sea ice are in danger, say scientists. Polar bears travel across the ice to hunt for seals. With less sea ice, polar bears have trouble finding food and surviving. ""If the sea ice were to disappear, animals that depend on the ice would face a greater risk of extinction,"" scientist Ted Scambos told
for the melting Arctic ice. Global warming is the gradual rise in Earths temperature.
Some scientists say people contribute to global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burn
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world.
""Things are changing very fast near the North Pole. Eventually, that is going to affect the rest of the world as well,"" says Scambos. ""This is going to be one of the great challenges facing people in the next 50 to 100 years.""
Earth is made up of many different habitats. The Arctic is a cold, windy environment called the
. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. No trees grow there because the soil is too cold. However, some plants grow in the tundra.
What are some ways people can reduce their need for fossil fuels?

170,"Many spiders weave round webs called orb webs.
Spider webs may look weak, but dont be fooled. They are actually super strong! Spider webs are made of silk. Silk is natures strongest
, or thread. Believe it or not, silk is stronger than its equal weight in steel!
Scientists have been making silk for years. However, they have not been able to produce silk as strong as a spiders silk. Now some scientists say they have figured out the secret to making strong silk.
what his team learned. He said that a spiders body has a little sac where it stores tiny blobs of silk in water. When the spider releases water, the blobs turn into a gel. The spider squeezes the gel from its body, and the silk hardens.
Scientists are now using what they learned to make a strong silk. They believe the silk will help people in many ways. It may be used for making clothes that protect police officers and soldiers.
Scientists say the silk may also be used to repair bones and ligaments in peoples bodies. A
is strong tissue that holds bones in place.
Besides silk, what other things in nature are useful to people? How are they useful?
Kaplan is very excited about his work. ""I hope this discovery will help get kids excited about science,"" he said. ""There is so much to be learned from nature.""

565,"The clock shows five seconds left in the game. Your team is losing by just one goal. You want to take the ball and score a goal. But you are cheering from the sidelines because you injured your leg. According to doctors, however, many sports injuries can be prevented.
Each year, about 20 million kids play sports during and after school. Unfortunately, about 5 million of those kids suffer some kind of injury while playing.
To help children play sports safely, the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation (NYSSF) has named April National Youth Sports Safety Month.
During April, the foundation plans to teach kids about sports safety. The foundation's message is that most sports injuries can be prevented.
According to the NYSSF, you can do a few things to keep from getting a sports injury:
Do warm-up stretches before and after playing any sport. Stretching helps loosen tight muscles and tissues.
Do not play when you are in pain. Pain is a sure sign of an injury!
Use proper sports safety equipment, such as helmets, elbow pads, kneepads, safety glasses, wrist guards, shin guards, and mouth guards.
The NYSSF says that playing sports and exercising help kids stay healthy and make friends. But no matter which sport you play, always remember to have fun!

. That means their body temperature depends on their environment.

student reporter Caitlin Bowen interviewed Brown about his job.
Reporter Caitlin Bowen talks to Arthurs Marc Brown.
I think it was growing up with a great-grandmother and a grandmother who told wonderful stories whenever we wanted them. ... My grandmother would tell spooky stories, and she would take out her false teeth [while she told them].
, or draw pictures, for someone elses book?
Its like getting a gift at a holidayopening up this box and there inside is this wonderful story.
How do the Arthur books help kids?
[I take] things that maybe kids are struggling with, [such as] a bully at school ... and try to make it a fun story. But [I also try to] make it be a way for them to learn something.

303,"Countries race to claim the top of the world.
World leaders are fired up over one of the coldest places on the planet. That place is called the Arctic. It is an icy area at the northernmost part of the world.
Some countries that border the Arctic claim parts of it as their
A territory is an area that is controlled by a country.
Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States want to own more of the Arctic. Thats because of what is buried under it. Experts say about one-fourth of the worlds untapped oil and gas lies beneath the Arctic Ocean. That would power a lot of cars.
The oil and gas could soon become easier to reach. Temperatures in the Arctic are rising. That is causing the sea ice there to melt.
is the cause for the meltdown. That is the slow rise of Earths temperature. Experts say that all the Arctics ice could be gone by 2035.
World leaders (above) discuss who should control the Arctic.
The countries leaders are working to prove the Arctic belongs to them. Under law, nations own about 200 miles of sea around their borders. However, if a countrys
lies beyond that, that country can claim more. A continental shelf is the underwater land that surrounds a continent.
World leaders recently met in Russia. There, they discussed who should control the Arctic. Catherine Loubier is a spokesperson for Canadas government. We take our responsibility for the future of the [Arctic] seriously, she says.
Countries with land in the Arctic Circle are the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.
Many people who live in the Arctic are Inuit. They are native, or local, to the area. About 150,000 Inuit live there.
Seals, fish, and whales live in the Arctic. About 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears live there too.
Who should get to decide which country or countries own the Arctic? Why?

518,"Imagine a guinea pig the size of a car! Scientists say such a large rodent lived about 6 million to 8 million years ago. They believe the giant animal weighed more than 1,500 pounds.
The creature had small ears and eyes and a very long tail. Scientists found the animal's remains in
(ven-eh-ZWAY-lah). That is a country in South America.
Why did those giant rodents become extinct? Their size might have caused them to die out. Scientists say such a huge animal would have had trouble outrunning and hiding from an attacking animal.

624,"Bedbugs are on the rise in the United States.
Sleepovers arent as fun as they used to be. Or at least they arent in New York, New York. Thats because
are the guests! Bedbugs are tiny insects that feed on blood.
The critters have crawled into the Big Apple and other cities. In fact, more than 20 states have major bedbug problems.
The adult bugs are the size of apple seeds. They may be small, but they cause big trouble. Bedbugs ... can travel far in search of a good meal, says scientist Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann.
Bedbugs hide in homes across the country.
The insects can live in mattresses and couches. They come out at night to eat. While people sleep, the bugs drink their blood. The bites dont hurt, but they can cause itchy bumps.
Those bumps are popping up all over. About 95 percent of U.S. pest control companies reported battling bedbugs in the past year. That is according to the National Pest Management Association. A rise in travel might be one reason. Travelers might carry the bugs in their suitcases.
might also be the problem. Those are chemicals that kill insects. Some pesticides may not be strong enough to get rid of bedbugs.
Officials arent taking the attacks lying down. New York made a law to
or stop, renters from moving into apartments that have bedbugs. That state also passed a law making schools tell parents about bedbug sightings.
Getting the word out is a good idea, Gangloff-Kaufmann told
The best way to get rid of bedbugs starts with prevention, she says.
Got bedbugs? Dogs can tell! Experts have trained pooches to use their powerful noses to sniff out the insects.
Peoples noses are too weak to find the scent. Dogs noses are much stronger. The dogs can locate the insects in just a few minutes.
Once pups find a bedbug, they sit down nearby. Then a pest control expert comes to get rid of the insects. Good dogs!
Why might the number of bedbugs grow quickly in big cities such as New York?

are now on a tour in the United States. An artifact is an object made by people long ago.
The exhibit is called ""Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs.""
is another name for an Egyptian ruler. The exhibit is touring the United States. It is now open at a museum in Los Angeles, California.
Now open in Los Angeles, Tut's exhibit will make stops in three other U.S. cities. It will return to Eygpt in 2007.
This isn't the first time Tut's treasures have visited the United States. Some of those artifacts came here in the 1970s.
""The first exhibit was about the discovery of the tomb and the treasures it held,"" history expert David Silverman told
. ""This exhibit is about the life of the young kinghis family, his history, and his responsibilities.""
Eight million people saw the first King Tut exhibit. Now millions more will have the chance to learn about the famous boy-king by visiting the new exhibit.

687,"Physical education teacher Marty Mentzer has put a new spin on poetry. She created the Basketball Poets club for fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in North Carolina.
The Basketball Poets meet once a week to read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball. Mentzer sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""I love poetry and sports,"" she told
Poetry gives the kids a chance to express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said Douglas Mitchell, 10.
The students have also met two published poetsKenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's book authors visited their school. ""They were professional and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said 9-year-old Hannah Niles.

48,"Dogs have a new best friendSophia Biddle!
The third grader from Odessa, Florida, recently gave a huge
of pet food to an animal shelter in her area. A donation is a gift.
Sophia, 8, presented the shelter with about $1,000 worth of pet supplies. The shelter is run by the Humane Society of the United States. That is an organization that protects animals. Sophias gift included loads of dog kibble and cat food. She also donated piles of toys and blankets.
Sophia Biddle is on a mission to feed animals.
The animal lover began raising funds for furry critters last year. Sophia collected money from her family and neighbors. The student also sold homemade bookmarks. The bookmarks were decorated with Sophias drawings of dogs and cats.
Why did Sophia decide to lend a paw to creatures in need? I really like animals, she told

627,"Where did Abraham Lincoln live while he was president? The White House is only half the answer. Lincoln and his family also lived in a 34-room house 3 miles from the White House. The building, called President Lincoln's Cottage, will open to the public on February 19.
When Lincoln didn't need to be at the White House, he stayed at the cottage. He worked on a draft of the
while there, according to experts. That is the document Lincoln signed to free most U.S. slaves in 1863 during the Civil War (18611865).
The cottage recently underwent an eight-year, $15 million
, or repair. Visitors to the cottage can tour the high-ceilinged rooms, view copies of books Lincoln read, and see a model of his desk.
""The White House has changed [since Lincoln lived there],"" Frank Milligan, director of the cottage, told

510,"Wildfires are a common occurrence in California.
Wildfires swept through southern California in early November. Fighting wildfires is no easy task.
It takes hard work, skill, and bravery.
spoke with Captain Brian Webster. For 27 years, he has been a firefighter in California. Here is what he told us:
: Were the wildfires difficult to fight?
: Yes! The Santa Ana winds blow hot, dry air from the desert at that time of year. They are very strong. Firefighters can't prevent the fires from burning until the winds stop.
: What is the best part of your job?
The excitement and adventure. I get to help people and save lives and property. That gives me a good feeling.
: What is the hardest part of your job?
: There is danger. It can also be sad. Sometimes, people lose their homes. Some people die. The long hours, not having enough sleep, and being away from my family are also difficult.
: Do firefighters work alone or in teams?
: Most of the time, we are a big team. We had more than 4,000 firefighters battling a wildfire in San Bernardino.
: How do you stay brave even when you are scared?
: That comes with experience. The longer you are a firefighter, the more control you have over your emotions. But even for the old-timers, this fire was a scary one.

658,"Whats the weather forecast for today? Thats a question for TV weatherman Al Roker.
kid reporter Cara Batelli, 10, visited Roker on the set of the
show to ask him about his job and hurricanes. The Atlantic hurricane season has been under way since June. It ends in November.
Cara: Why is it important to teach people about the weather?
If you know what the weather is, you can stay safe and protect yourself, especially when there are severe storms.
Cara: Have you ever been scared in weather?
I was on television during Hurricane Wilma [in 2005]. The wind was so strong that I got blown over on live television.
Cara: What is the best thing to do when a hurricane is approaching?
Listen to authorities; when they say get out,
Cara: Why is weather so hard to predict?
You are really predicting the future, and thats never an easy thing to do.
Hurricanes begin as storms over warm ocean water.
During a hurricane, wind speeds reach at least 74 miles per hour.

15,"Bats in the northeastern United States are in trouble. Thousands of bats are becoming sick and dying. They have white-nose syndrome. The disease is named after a white
that some bats are getting on their noses. A fungus is a type of plant life that can cause disease in animals.
Scientists are working to find out why the bats are getting sick. They want to solve the mystery quickly. With fewer bats, there will be more insects. That could be a big problem for people, say scientists.

453,"Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York recently found some surprising news. They discovered that most people did not know that threefourths of Earth is covered with water. Very few people knew that only 1 percent of the world's water is drinkable. What could the museum do?
The museum decided to create a special exhibit that teaches visitors about water. The exhibit will open in 2008.
""We have the opportunity to educate the public about issues of ... concern to them,"" said museum president Ellen Futter. The museum will design the exhibit based on what people want to know about water.

562,"A group of sandhill cranes made their first flight last fall by learning to follow the leader. But their leader was not another crane. The birds followed a scientist who flew a small airplane.
Eleven sandhill cranes flew from Wisconsin to Florida last fall. The birds followed a scientist flying a small airplane on the 39-day trip.
Each fall, cranes travel from cold areas, like Wisconsin, to warm areas, like Florida. Baby cranes learn from their parents how to make the trip. But these cranes learned to follow scientists.
When the sandhill cranes hatched, the first thing they saw was a group of scientists dressed to look like adult cranes. The scientists fed the chicks. The chicks thought the scientists were their mothers.
Then the scientists trained the young birds to follow an airplane. The scientists played a tape of the noise that planes make. They also played sounds adult sandhill cranes make. So the cranes learned to trust and follow people in planes.
By flying to Florida, 11 sandhill cranes were helping their cousins, the whooping cranes. Many sandhill cranes live in the United States. But few whooping cranes live here anymore.
Only one group of whooping cranes knows how to
, or travel, from the North to the South. Scientists hope to teach other whooping cranes to migrate. More cranes may survive if they can learn to travel back and forth.
Next year, scientists will train whooping cranes to migrate the same way they trained sandhill cranes.

330,"Hundreds of kids will be dancing this summer. They will be going to AileyCamp. The camp is a free sixweek program for boys and girls ages 11 to 14. Some kids wait years to be accepted to the program.
There are 10 AileyCamps across the country. The kids who are chosen live in poor sections of cities. Those children dont usually have a lot of arts experiences available to them, says Nasha Thomas-Schmitt. She is codirector of Ailey Arts in Education. Along with dance, they learn how to become responsible young people. We teach them not to give up on their dreams and to work hard.
AileyCamp students in Missouri learn a new dance.
The AileyCamps teach kids this saying: I will not use the word

457,"Lunch is a special treat at Fisher Hill School in Orange, Massachusetts. The fruits and vegetables are always fresh picked. They come from a nearby farm. I like the apples. They are juicy, says Alyssa Rousseau, age 8.

341,"Mother monarchs lay many eggs. Their eggs are very tiny. Monarchs lay their eggs only on the leaves of milkweed plants. Monarchs' eggs take about three to five days to hatch.
A caterpillar hatches from an egg by eating the eggshell. A monarch caterpillar then eats milkweed leaves for food. Monarch caterpillars feed on leaves for about two weeks.
A caterpillar finds a safe place to form a hard shell. Inside the shell, the pupa changes into a butterfly. That takes about 10 to 14 days.
Soon an adult butterfly comes out. It is wet and wrinkled. Once it is dry, it is ready to fly away. In time, the adult might lay its own eggs.

509,"Ann Bancroft and Liv Arnesen are trying to become the first women to ski across Antarctica. They plan to ski 4,200 miles in 100 days. That is the longest distance ever skied by women.
The women began their journey in November. That is spring in Antarctica. But the average temperature is 39 degrees below zero! Freezing winds blow at 100 miles per hour.
The wind is helping Arnesen and Bancroft. They attach themselves and the sleds that carry their supplies to sails, so the wind helps them ski faster. They hope to finish their trip later this month.

Vice President Al Gore hopes Americans will elect him president of the United States.
If he wins the election, Gore will stay in Washington, D.C., where he now lives. Gore also lived in Washington, D.C., as a kid. His father was a United States senator.
Gore also spent time as a kid in Carthage, Tennessee. In Carthage, Gore's family owned a farm. Gore helped take care of the farm animals.
Gore says he believes the hard work he did on the farm will help him be a good president. He has chosen Senator Joseph Lieberman to run for the vice presidency. On Election Day, voters will decide who will become our president and vice president.
asked Al Gore some questions. Here's what he had to say:
My father and mother were heroes for me. I really respected the way they lived their lives.
When you were a kid, what was your favorite book?
by Richard and Florence Atwater. I thought it was very funny.
Will you protect animals that are endangered?
Yes. I want to protect the environment--the air, the water, the land, and the Earth itself.
I believe that we need to build new kinds of cars and machines that [give off] much less pollution.

221,"If you think spiderwebs are weak, think again! Spiderwebs are made of
. That is one of the strongest materials. In fact, silk is stronger than the same amount of steel!
A spider squeezes a sticky liquid from its body. That liquid hardens into a strong silk thread. Scientists are working to make silk that is as strong as a spider's. They are getting closer to learning how.
""We use lots of different machines to see how spiders make their silk,"" says scientist Chris Holland. ""The machines can show us how strong the silk is and what it is made of.""
Holland says, ""We recently discovered that to make silk like a spider's, we have to start with the right material. We have been using a material that was too runny. In spiders, it is thick like mayonnaise [MAY-uh-nayz].""
, or make, a stronger silk. It may be used to make clothes that are strong but light in weight. The clothes may one day protect soldiers and astronauts.
Spiders use silk in several important ways.
A grass spider uses silk to make a shelter. A shelter is a place where an animal lives.
An orb weaver spider makes a sticky web to trap prey. A spider's prey is any animal that it eats.
A female candy-stripe spider wraps silk around her eggs to protect them.

98,"Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. with Pres. Lyndon Johnson in the background in 1966
Martin Luther King Jr. had an American dream. He dreamed that all people would be treated equally. He dreamed that all American people would be treated the same, no matter how they looked or what they believed.
In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. told Americans about his dream. He gave a speech in Washington, D.C., on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He reminded people that the Constitution of the United States promised everyone equal rights. Equal rights means that everyone should be treated the same. He asked all people to share and follow his dream.
Many memorials are in Washington, D.C. A memorial is a special statue or place built to honor a person or an event. This is how the memorial for King will look.
The memorial will be built near the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. The memorial is meant to remind people of justice, democracy, and hope-all things King worked for.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He stood up for the freedoms and rights of African Americans and other people. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is on January 20. On that day, people will think about and honor Martin Luther King Jr. What will you do to honor him?
The King memorial will help people remember him. How else can you remember him?

404,"Americans will soon have a new president.
President George W. Bush sits at his desk in the Oval Office. That is a room in the White House.
Americans vote for a president every four years. George W. Bush is our president today. He has held the job for eight years. After his first four years, he was elected again. He cannot be elected for a third time. That is because the law says that a president cannot serve more than twice.

599,"Some experts say that computers can harm kids. They say kids can hurt their bodies while using computers.
Some experts say kids can hurt their bodies if they use computers too much. For example, staring at a computer screen for a long time can hurt a kid's eyes.
Many kids do not sit up straight while using a computer. Some kids do not have the proper desk and chair. That means kids have to stretch their arms and wrists to reach the computer's mouse and keyboard. Kids can hurt their wrists while stretching to use a computer.
Experts also worry that kids are not getting enough exercise because of computers. Some kids would rather use a computer than play a sport or a game. Kids need exercise to stay healthy.
Imagine a classroom filled with computers and students--but no teacher. That's what some experts think school will be like in 2010. They say that kids will eventually take all their classes
. That means students will use computers and the Internet to connect with teachers and kids from all over the world. For example, a teacher in Africa might teach you a lesson about elephants!
Technology experts say that kids' backpacks will be filled with the latest technology. Instead of notebooks and pencils, you might carry a laptop computer and an e-book reader!
Experts give these suggestions for using a computer the right way.
Sit up straight! Make sure you can easily reach the keyboard and the mouse without stretching.
Try to use a desk and chair that are made for kids your size. The top of the computer screen should be at your eye level.
If you have to use a desk and chair made for adults, sit on books or pillows. Rest your feet on a box.
Be sure your work area is well lit.

272,"Monarch butterflies live in fields where milkweed plants grow. They drink
from plants with flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid food.
In the fall, monarch butterflies take a long trip. They
(MY-grayt). That means they move from one place to another. Monarchs in the United States and Canada fly south to warmer places. Most fly to Mexico.
In the winter, monarchs rest. They stay close together on trees. That keeps them warm. It also keeps them safe from wind and rain.
In early spring, monarch butterflies fly north. On the way, female monarchs lay eggs on milkweed plants The eggs hatch, and the new butterflies fly north.
Why might monarch butterflies need to rest in winter?

. That is a written plan that tells the
of our country. A law is a rule. The plan was written more than 200 years ago.
 Long ago, our country had many different rules. People wanted to have one set of rules. At the time, the United States was a new country. It was made up of only 13 states.
 A group of leaders talked about the rules. They planned to write one set of rules. They wanted to make the country better. George Washington was one of those leaders.
 The leaders met in Independence Hall. That is a building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They wrote the rules by hand. The rules start with the words We the People.
 The leaders signed the new set of rules for people to follow. The rules became known as the United States Constitution.

74,"The teddy bear celebrates its 104th birthday.
Do you have a lovable teddy bear? If so, start planning a birthday party! The teddy bear celebrates its 104th birthday this month.
Stuffed toy bears have been around for a long time. They were named after the 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, in 1902. He was sometimes called Teddy. One day, he went hunting with some friends. They found an injured bear. The president did not want to shoot it. He

588,"The prehistoric ""terror bird"" was larger than an adult man.
A teenager recently discovered the skull of a huge prehistoric bird in Argentina, a country in South America. Scientists say the 10-foot-tall bird had a sharp, hooked beak and thin legs. They think that the bird probably ate animals as large as sheep and ran fast.
The big bird belonged to a group of birds called ""terror birds"" that once lived on Earth. ""It is an unbelievable creature.

26,"Imagine sending out 25 e-mails and getting 115,000 e-mails back. That's what happened to John Street and his fourth-grade class in Newcastle, Nebraska.
The students wanted to learn about the countries of the world. So they sent 25 e-mails to Street's friends. People who got the e-mails were asked to
, or send along, the e-mails to someone else. The students asked everyone to send them an e-mail that told their location. They pinpointed each location on a world map.
E-mails came from every continent and dozens of countries. Many more people mailed letters to the students.
Street said he made one mistake with the project. He didn't include an end date. Nearly a year later, the e-mails show no signs of stopping.

390,"The map shows the area where tzi was found.
In 1991, the frozen body of a man who lived 5,000 years ago was found in the tztal (oet-sahl) alps. Those are mountains on the continent of europe.
Scientists named the ""iceman"" tzi (oet-see). Recently, scientists thawed tzi so they could study his body.
tzi is the world's oldest frozen mummy. Scientists want to learn more about tzi. So they thawed and examined his body. Scientists took samples of tzi's bones and skin. The samples might help scientists figure out more about tzi's life.
Samples from tzi's stomach and teeth may tell scientists what kind of food he ate. Some foods grew only in certain areas. Knowing about tzi's diet will help scientists figure out where he lived.
tzi lived thousands of years ago. Knowing about tzi's life will tell scientists more about life on Earth long ago.
tzi was between 25 and 40 years old when he died.
tzi was 5 feet 2 inches tall.
tzi had tattoos on his left foot, left knee, and lower back.
tzi had curly brown hair. Scientists found the hairs in tzi's hat.
Some tools and objects that were found near tzi. tzi's ax helped scientists figure out how long he had been frozen. The blade on his ax was made of a reddish brown metal called
Copper was used in tools thousands of years ago. Scientists figured out that tzi had been frozen for about 5,300 years!

298,"Scientists have made a big discovery. They found the bones of a new type of hadrosaur. The bones were dug up in Mexico near the city of Saltillo (sahl-TEE-yoh).
The dinosaur was 25 feet long. It was not fully grown, say scientists. An adult would have been about 35 feet long.
Scientists named the dinosaur Velafrons (VEL-ah-frahnz). The name is a mix of Latin and Spanish. It means sailed forehead. The top of the dinosaurs head was shaped like a sail.

72,"The National Weather Service can usually predict when and where a tornado will strike. Tornado warnings let people know to get to safety. The warnings are usually given on radio and television stations. Some places have loud sirens to warn people. If a tornado warning is given, experts say to do the following:
Move to an inside room or hallway on the lowest floor.
Get under a sturdy table, and cover your head with your arms.
