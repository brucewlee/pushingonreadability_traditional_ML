642,"The Battle of the Little Bighorn 1876
The Battle of the Little Bighorn 1876
Custer's last stand at the Little Bighorn, from a contemporary engraving
This painting depicts the traditional view about the heroism of Custer and his men at the Battle of the Little Bighorn - Custer can be seen brandishing two guns, fighting until the very end.
However, this painting illustrates the problem of
of sources. This depiction is almost certainly wrong. An archaeological survey in 1983 found that Custer's men fell in a running battle, perhaps as they scattered and fled down the hillside towards the river. It also found that Custer was not scalped, which suggests that he shot himself, because the Sioux did not scalp a suicide.

4850,"Hemingway does not give a lot of direct explanation of how people are feeling, or what their motives are. His language is also quite bare. Instead, he likes to use symbols.
Remember the setting and think about what it might represent:
The minnows are described as sprinkling the surface ""like a handful of shot"". Hemingway does not use many similes in his writing, so why this one? What is the significance of what the minnows are being compared to?
How well is the fishing going? Who is in charge when they are setting the night-lines? What could that symbolise about their relationship?
Marjorie is described as not reeling in (that is, stopping) ""until the boat touched the shore"". She hopes for it to go well right up until the last minute. What does that tell you about her attitude to Nick?
The body language of the main characters is important. Think about how their positions on the blanket are described through the course of their conversation. How many times does Hemingway mention their positions, and why?
The moon seems to be significant. It could represent the end of their relationship. Look at what the characters say about it, and think about what they might really mean. It is only when the moon has finally come up completely that Nick has the courage to tell Marjorie what is really on his mind.

7331,"One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906-1914. Many historians label this period the beginning of the
A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:
Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the
. This imposed severe punishments for neglecting or treating children cruelly. It was made illegal to sell cigarettes to children or send them out begging. Separate juvenile courts were set up, which sent children convicted of a crime to
In the UK, a place of detention for young male offenders. They were introduced in 1908, and are now replaced by 'young offender institutions'.
were introduced for the over 70s, which gave them 5s a week, or 7s 6d to a married couple. Old people cried as they collected their pensions, and said: 'God bless Lord George'.

was passed. Part 1 of the act gave people the right to
of 10s a week for 26 weeks in return for a payment of 4d a week. Part 2 of the Act gave people the right to unemployment pay (
) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.
- which had a good system of state welfare for workers, was passing Britain as a great industrial power.
meant politicians feared that, unless standards of living improved for the workers, they might turn to Communism or rebellion.
and it was attracting working-class voters because of its demands for welfare reform.
Liberal Party did not get a majority
of seats in the House of Commons, so it had a coalition with the 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected.
Many government politicians, especially Lloyd George, genuinely wanted to
By 1914, 150,000 children were getting one good meal a day.

Kept many old people out of the workhouse.

By 1914, 1 million people were being employed through the labour exchange.
Most of these jobs were temporary or part-time; the government did not do anything to increase the number of jobs available.
A vital safety net to tide people over hard times.
Poor people had to pay the contributions out of their wages; dole and sickness pay only lasted for a limited time; and
Seven shillings and six pence in old money (around 38p of today's money).
was not enough to live on - a family of five needed 1 a week.
Only for the wage-earner - it was not available to their wife or children.
A plan for expected income and spending over a specified time period.
- to pay for the reforms, Lloyd George's 1909 budget raised duties on tobacco and spirits, raised income tax by 16 per cent (from 1s to 1s 2d), and introduced a new 20 per cent tax on profits from selling land.
When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

391,"The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

may have one theme or many. Understanding the themes makes the text more than 'just' a text. It becomes something more significant because we're encouraged to think more deeply about the story - about how it connects to real-life issues, and about what it might mean to us.
The boys try to construct a civilisation on the island; but it breaks down in blood and terror because the boys are suffering from the terrible disease of being human.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
is that of things breaking down. This is shown in a number of ways. Violence replaces peace, friends turn into enemies, life ends in savage death. Everything degenerates.
The boys are on the island because the plane that was evacuating them from Britain during a fictional nuclear war was attacked. Piggy reminds Ralph:
""Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb? They're all dead.""
Ralph is proud of his father - a commander in the Navy. So, the
A person portrayed by an actor in a play; an individual in a narrative or non-fiction text; a real or imaginary individual's personality or reputation
who tries hardest to keep peace comes from a home that revolved around war.
We know that the civilisation from which they were trying to escape is being destroyed. When Roger stops himself throwing stones at the littluns, we're told:
""Roger's arm was conditioned by a civilisation that knew nothing of him and was in ruins.""
The dead parachutist who lands on the island was gunned down during an overhead battle.
Ironically, the naval officer who comes to their rescue is himself involved in the war. The boys may have been saved from life on the island, but what sort of life are they going back to?
Violence is always present. It starts as a game, but grows more horrific throughout the novel. For example:
When he first finds out Piggy's name,
""Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a fighter-plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy.""
When the first pig is killed, Jack boasts,
""Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Bash her in.""
The boys become like wild and savage animals: when Jack hunts a pig he is
; Ralph becomes like a hunted animal, not a boy, at the end:
""He raised his spear, snarled a little, and waited.""
The murder of Simon is particularly horrific because it involves
the other boys - they get caught up in the frenzied chant:
""The crowd ... leapt onto the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore.""
All the friendships and good relationships on the island break down, either through bullying and violence or death.
Ralph and Jack seem to be friends at the start, yet Ralph knows Jack is hurt when he is not elected chief. This rivalry for power is at the root of some of the violence.
Ralph finds it hard even at an early stage to get things done. He and Simon are left to build the third shelter by themselves, because everyone else is too busy having fun. The community spirit of the assemblies is hard to maintain.
Even the littluns' games involve violence and broken friendships. Once Roger watches them playing:
""Percival had gone off, crying, and Johnny was left in triumphant possession of the castles.""
As pressure builds, the boys find that they have to take sides. When Jack defies Ralph and goes off alone, he challenges,
""Anyone who wants to hunt when I do can come too.""
He ignores Ralph's effort to make peace.
Jack's tribe becomes ruled by fear. Most boys don't want to be involved, but have no option. He keeps control by intimidating them and bullying them, such as when he ties up and beats Wilfred.
Roger rules by terror too. When Samneric are captured,
""Roger advanced upon them as one wielding a nameless authority.""
The island is first seen as like paradise, too good to be true. Ralph thinks:
""Here at last was the imagined but never fully realised place leaping into real life""
However, the island is soon found to contain many dangers. For example, coconuts fall from the trees and just miss injuring Roger, the sun burns them, and the isolation is a curse.
Ralph reflects at the end that the island once had a
All this echoes the Bible story of the Fall of Man, when Adam and Eve were cast out of Paradise as a punishment for disobeying God. The island becomes a burnt wasteland, as if as a punishment for all the violence committed by the boys.
The language used by the boys progressively degenerates.

The title of the novel comes from the Arabic for one of the manifestations of the Devil. Baal-Zebub - or Beelzebub - means 'lord of the flies'.

5500,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the
it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's
he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a solemn, decisive way, showing Heaney's confidence that he will be able to survive the storm?
in a relaxed, chatty way - suggesting that conversation takes his mind off the storm?
in a frightened way, betraying anxiety and fear?
In a way all three tones would be appropriate, because the poem starts off expressing chatty confidence in the island's ability to shrug off the storm. Midway through, however, the use of phrases like 'full / Blast, 'the thing you fear', 'Exploding comfortably' betrays anxiety mixed in with the bravado; while by the end of the poem the storm has become frightening and violent - a spitting cat, a strafing dive-bomber.
The ideas in this poem concern our uneasy relationship to powerful natural forces, and the feelings of vulnerability and fear we feel in the face of the potentially destructive might of a storm. Have a look at these quotes from the poem, and our suggestions about how these ideas are expressed in each of them.
We are prepared: we build our houses squat...
The opening words of the poem suggests a community readying itself to endure wartime bombing or bombardment - an idea which Heaney returns to at the end of the poem.
But there are no trees, no natural shelter.
Heaney seems affectionate towards the island at first, wryly admitting it has never troubled them, yet here the But is significant: it is as if the island has let them down. They are at the mercy of the storm with no natural shelter.
We just sit tight while wind dives And strafes invisibly
Heaney recognises that he is powerless in the storm. There is nothing that man can do but sit tight while the wind attacks. It's like being under enemy fire.
Heaney finds their fears strange because the object of fear is not tangible - it's 'a huge nothing'. So are the fears imaginary or real? Is he afraid of the wind, or doesn't he know what to be afraid of?

3342,"Food additives are included in food to improve their shelf-life, appearance and flavour. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid prevent food from going off by reacting with oxygen. Emulsifiers help oil and water to mix - for example, in mayonnaise. Active packaging meanwhile improves the quality or safety of food.
Everything in food is made from chemicals. Some of these are natural, and some are artificial. Processed foods, including vegetable oils, may have chemicals added to them. These
have different roles, including extending a products shelf-life and improving its taste and appearance.
You can find additives listed on the ingredients label. Many have E numbers to identify them. The table below describes some of these:
orange colouring for soft drinks, sweets and sauces
allows oil and water to mix to make margarine, ice-cream and salad cream
Additives with an E number have been licensed by the European Union. Some are natural, some artificial. But they have all been safety tested and passed for use.
The UK Food Standards Agency - FSA - has strict limits on the amount of colouring allowed in food. Some people have allergic reactions to certain additives, and colourings are banned from baby food.
A red dye called 'Sudan I' was banned for use in food because it was thought to be a health risk. Some of the dye had been used in chilli powder before the ban came into force, and the dye was later added in this form to some foods by mistake. Hundreds of food items had to be taken off supermarket shelves and destroyed.
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.
bacteria and fungi grow on or in the food
chemical reactions take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Modern packaging is designed to control or prevent reactions in food that make it go off. Such packaging includes:
cans that will cool down or heat up their contents
Ascorbic acid - vitamin C - is an antioxidant that is found naturally in foods such as citrus fruits, green peppers, green, leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, and potatoes. As E300, it may be added to food such as meat pies and salad cream.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen (as well as the food itself) to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Active packaging improves the quality or safety of the food it contains.
Oxygen can be restricted by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available so that microbes cannot grow and reproduce.
There are other benefits to this method:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals.

3764,"Atticus takes on the defence of Tom Robinson, a Negro. Scout is taunted about this by various children, including her cousin Francis at a family Christmas gathering - he calls Atticus a 'nigger lover'. Jem and Scout's admiration for their father rises enormously, though, when he shoots a dangerous mad dog with one shot.
When old Mrs Dubose also insults the children because of Atticus' involvement in Tom Robinson's case, Jem is so furious that he beheads every camellia in her yard. As a punishment, Jem has to read to her every night for a month. When she dies, Atticus explains to the children that she was a morphine addict who was trying to break the habit and succeeded just before her death ' rather than hate her they should admire her courage.

1137,"A theme is a subject or idea that keeps appearing in the text. You usually find more than one theme in a story. They help to hold the story together, and often encourage us to think more about the plot, and what lies beyond it
""You're so innocent, you didn't realise. You're too trusting, too kind, you don't know what these people can be like.""
The narrator wishes her daughter was still innocent like a young child. She is shocked and disgusted at the evidence she finds of her growing experience.
The mother also feels guilty and ashamed of her own sexual experience before marriage, and has kept it a secret. This relates to the narrator's obsession with purity.
The word 'white' is often mentioned. And cleanliness is important to her, too.
The daughter, by contrast, is seen as 'dirty', lying 'on a pile of filth', living the most sordid life the narrator can imagine.
What is interesting about these contrasting ideas is that we realise things are not always what they seem. The narrator seems to have high moral standards, but when she was young she broke the rules, too.
""I had to help with the housework but my brother did nothing.""
The narrator seems to have different standards for men and women:
It's OK for men to use bad language, but not women.
Fathers are in charge, and might be strict if you do not abide by the rules.
Men do not like to talk about emotions.
Women should keep the house tidy and learn to cook.
Women should not say how they feel. They should also avoid being rude.
When a man loses his temper, a woman should accept this and not defend herself.
Women who try to make themselves look attractive are 'tarts'.
Girls who are curious about sex before marriage are 'dirty'.
Which of these points do you agree or disagree with?
You may think it is no wonder the daughter ran away. You might also comment that these expectations belong to a different era to the modern day.
""Rows of high heels, all of them too small for her, she was so vain, all of them moulded to the shape of her feet.""
The narrator wants to control her daughter, but finds that she cannot do this.
The narrator feels the need to control her emotions. She finds this increasingly difficult as the story progresses.
The daughter displays a lack of control: she loses her temper, drinks alcohol, binges on food, and does not want to wait until marriage before having sex.
The narrator's mother displayed a lack of control, too: she was ""plump"", said things without thinking, and had rows of shoes that were too small for her - but wore them anyway, rather than sensible shoes.
The narrator finds comfort in the fact that she can lock up the shoes, tie them together, make them clean, and keep them safe and warm in bed.
""They're best in here with me I think, safe and warm in bed. Tucked up tight.""
The narrator could not live up to her father's expectations.
Her daughter is not living up to her expectations.
The narrator is sad that she was not close to her mother.
She recognises the distance between herself and her daughter's generation.

6076,"Farmers started to work scientifically for the first time during the 1830s. Many new improvements were the result of individuals, such as Justus von Liebig, experimenting, observing and explaining how crop yields could be enlarged and improved.
The main improvements introduced in the 1830s, which were the main characteristics of High Farming, covered fertilisers, drainage and steam power coupled with support from government initiatives.
Illustration of a bird with guano (bird droppings)
- a scientist called Sir John Lawes started the production and use of phosphate fertilisers and super phosphates, which were initially by-products of industrial processes. The other most commonly used fertiliser from the 1830s onwards was guano (bird droppings) from the Andes Mountains in Peru. Soil in Britain became richer and produced higher yields as a result.
- new steam-operated machines were invented that could lay drainage pipes in straight lines. These drainage pipes cleared water from flooded fields and subsequently improved the quality of agricultural land in Great Britain.
- steam became the new method of powering farming machinery, which made the agricultural process more efficient. Examples of new steam-powered machinery included ploughs, seed drills, threshing machines and from 1852 onwards, steam-powered reapers. Unfortunately, most of these new steam-powered machines were invented in America and were not practical for use on the smaller enclosed British fields in the late 19th century.
- for the very first time, the government gave out 28 million in loans to help farmers use these new techniques and ideas on their fields. The government also forced remaining open land to be enclosed.

5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

245,"They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

5867,"Using life cycle assessments (Ideas about science)
The use of a life cycle assessment, or LCA, may involve studying social and economic circumstances, sustainability, regulations and laws. These can help you to make an informed decision about the use of a material or product.
When using a life cycle assessment to make decisions about the use of a material or product, it is important to:
know that some questions can be addressed using a scientific approach, and some cannot
be able to identify the groups of people who may be affected, and the main benefits and costs of a course of action for each group
be able to explain whether the use of the material is sustainable
recognise that there are regulations and laws that control scientific research and applications
Read on if you are taking the
Feasibility and course of action - higher only

4208,"Theres no denying it, the sporting world has never been so illuminated under the media spotlight. Sporting events and sports personalities are bigger, brighter and more branded with big money sponsorship deals than ever before; just look at major events like the Premier Leagues Barclays Bank partnership. Then theres our perception of sport through the eyes of the media; what you read and see isnt always the truth and can often be affected by international politics. Today, many athletes are role models and celebrities in their own right. Well, who hasnt heard of David Beckham?
To support an event, activity or person by providing money or goods.
is a major feature of sport in the 21st century.
Most competitions have sponsors names included in their title:
Some sports stadia have sponsored names. For example:
Most clubs and teams have sponsors. For example:
is no longer legal. Sports Governing Bodies have to decide if proposed sponsorship, say junior sport by an alcohol brand, is acceptable.
It is always easier to get sponsorship if a sport or event receives media attention. High profile events gain greater amounts of sponsorship than those with no coverage.
There are pros and cons of sponsorship:
Increased publicity, status increased by being linked to success and glamour. Increased sales of their products
Negative events (drug use, cheating, crowd trouble) may affect your reputation
Free clothing and equipment or payment for wearing sponsor's clothing and using their equipment. Can concentrate on training without financial worries.
May be tied in to a contract including appearances at sponsors' events.
Financial support in addition to admission fees etc.
Dates, times, clothing may be changed to suit the sponsor.
a collective name for images, video and audio
coverage of sport is widespread. By listening to commentators, pundits and watching replays we improve our knowledge and understanding. Participation in sports covered by the media is always higher than for those that are not.
When watching sport on TV it is important to understand that the director of the programme will have an influence on what is seen and said. You should always analyse what you see and develop your own opinions about events.
Media coverage has many pros and cons:
Attendances may rise as people want to see the 'stars'
Gives viewers a close-up view of the action
Attendances may drop - more people watch from home
Some sports get lots of exposure, while others get none
Events can be sensationalised to promote the media (TV channel, newspaper etc), rather than the sport
Changes to playing season (eg rugby league)
Changes to the rules (eg badminton, volleyball rally-point rules, tennis tie-breaks)
NB Some of these may not been seen as disadvantages by those involved, but they do show the influence of the media.
The conduct of players, officials and spectators has an effect on the image of individual sports and the expectations of behaviour by those involved in them. Compare some examples of conduct in sports:
Golfers are expected to own up to anything they do wrong
- Players are expected to own up to anything that they do wrong and even disqualify themselves.
- Diving by players to get a free kick or penalty is increasing and almost everyone is complaining about it. But accepting the rewards when cheating benefits
- Opposition fans sit and stand together and there is usually a friendly atmosphere. Police presence and stewarding is light. Video surveillance is almost unheard of.
- Although most supporters enjoy the company of the opposition's fans, they are segregated to avoid outbreaks of violence by a minority. Groups of fans taunt each other with insults. Police presence and stewarding is very well organised. Video surveillance is used to identify troublemakers who are banned from future matches. All-seater stadia are required for all Premier League and international matches.
- The laws of the game penalise players for arguing with the referee although some acts of violence are dealt with as part of the game. Etiquette requires that the players always clap each other off the field and problems are left on the pitch.
- Players often surround the referee to argue with decisions. Acts of violence are often made worse by other players becoming involved and fans continuing to inflame the situation by booing players. Some disagreements on the pitch are continued and fights can break out in the tunnel after the game.
Do the fans encourage players to play well or behave badly? Or do the players incite the fans to celebrate or abuse each other?
Winners of major tournaments can earn large sums
A sportsperson who is not paid for taking part in sport.
. However, in demanding success many team owners and sponsors have encouraged players to become
A sportsperson who is paid to take part in sport.
. Tennis and rugby union are examples of sports that attempted to remain amateur but are now ' open' which means no distinction is made between amateurs and professionals. One of the reasons was the widespread abuse of hidden payments to amateurs following the worldwide increase in money for sport from the media.
Key differences between amateurs and professionals are:
Participation is more important than the result
Winning is the most important thing. The more they win, the more they earn
Political and financial issues that have affected international sports events
Despite the many advantages of hosting a major international event host nations must be prepared for difficulties. The Olympic Games has suffered from a number of different types of problem. These include:
Race issue: Black Power - 1968, Mexico City
Boycott by some nations - 1984, Los Angeles
For the exam you should know a little bit about each of these and you should keep up-to-date with events as they happen.
The 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies suffered problems relating to high ticket prices which prevented many locals from attending whilst matches were played in near empty stadiums. In addition the media coverage and police action surrounding the death of Pakistan coach, Bob Woolmer, took attention away from the matches.
The 2008 Beijing Olympics have generated lots of media intest and the 2012 London Olympics and future Football and Rugby World Cups will create many discussion points over the next few years.
The role of local and national sports providers
funded facilities are paid for by national and local government out of taxes and National Lottery funding. They can be found throughout the country.
They are available for everyone to use and are relatively cheap.
They include sports/leisure centres, swimming pools and outdoor pitches.
Some schools share facilities with the local authority for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
funded facilities are set up by private companies that try to make a profit. They are often members-only clubs. Members pay fees to join and use the facilities.
They are likely to be more expensive.
They include sports/fitness clubs, golf and tennis clubs.
Some schools pay to use private sports clubs for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
Local authorities encourage participation in sport by employing sport development teams including School Sports Coordinators who arrange events, assist with coaching and develop links with clubs in the area of schools.

6438,"Despite efforts to 'turn metric', it is obvious that there are still many imperial units in use today. For example do you know your height in
? It is therefore helpful to know how to convert between the two.
Converting from one metric unit to another
Perhaps the most common metric conversions are between mm, cm, m and km.
1 m = 100 cm = 1000 mm
1 km = 1000 m = 100 000 cm = 1 000 000 mm
, so 1 km = 1000 m
Once you are confident with conversions between mm, cm, m and km, converting units of mass and capacity is eaier.
1 km = 1000 m, so 1 kg = 1000 g
1 m = 100 cm, so 1 l (litre) = 100 cl (centilitres)
1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 g = 1000 mg (milligrams)
A packet of biscuits weighs 150 g. Find the weight of 12 packets of biscuits:
12  150 = 1800, so 12 packets of biscuits weigh 1800g.
Remember that 1 kg = 1000 g. To convert from g to kg, we divide by 1000.

1200,"Michle Roberts had a troubled relationship with her mother, a major theme of
, it is useful to know something about the author and what may have inspired her story.
Michle Roberts was born in 1949 in London. She had a strict Catholic upbringing and, as she grew up, came to disagree with the way her religion viewed women. In an interview with the BBC World Service, she said:
""We had to be forgiven for being women before we even began to try to be good, we had to get over having the bodies we had. This really pushed me into wanting to write as a way of opposing what was very constricting, and actually painful, in my life.""
Her family disapproved of her writing. In particular, she had a troubled relationship with her mother, although in recent years she has become close to her again. Roberts explores mother/daughter relationships in much of her writing.

3778,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
, you need to think about the ideas and attitudes in the poem, and then decide how you would read it aloud.
in a bitter way, suggesting Robin is angry that Batman prevented him from growing up for so long
in a thoughtful way, suggesting that Robin is reflecting on his experiences with Batman
triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last.
Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...

Diabetes  risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
Weighing up the consequences - higher only
Everyone has to make choices about whether to accept the risks associated with some activities. We accept risk every day. Crossing a busy street involves a risk of being knocked over by a car. We accept this risk because we know that this event is very unlikely to happen. But we also know that if it did happen the result could be very serious.
To decide whether we should accept a risk, we need to consider:
what is the chance of the event occurring
what are the consequences to us if the event does occur
With reference to diabetes, each person must make a decision about the diet they eat based on:
the chance of their getting diabetes if they eat poorly or are obese

3975,"An example of work from Karimah's journal
In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work.
to develop and explore your ideas, like Karimah has done. Write your progress in your work journal, so the examiner knows how your work has progressed.
My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

5167,"Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

5428,"You need to go to the exam with strategies that will help you work well under pressure. Here are some suggestions:
You are usually given 5 minutes to read through the paper before the tape starts. Use this to your advantage by looking right through the paper so see what kind of tasks there are.
Look closely! Should you listen for precise information (like train arrival and departure times)? Or should you be listening to the whole passage, in order to draw a conclusion (for example, name the girl who has the best relationship with her parents)?
As you read the question, try to predict the sort of information that may be in the passage. It will help focus your mind.
Look at the title of the question or section very carefully. Make sure you understand
to give your answer. If there is an example, look closely at the answer given - it will show you whether you need to write a single letter, a single word, or more than one word.
Have a good look at any illustrations. They could give important clues as to what is coming.
word - there is probably a lot of 'redundant' language you don't need. Be positive. Concentrate on what you do understand. Sometimes the passage can be difficult, but the questions are easy.
Use your knowledge of grammar. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is talking about the past, the present, or the future.
Use your knowledge of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, if you hear someone was on holiday in Madrid, it is unlikely they spent time on the beach.
Don't just listen to the words. The tone of someone's voice may also be helpful - for example in telling you if they are making a statement or asking a question.
If you have to write answers in Spanish, remember you will not be penalised for minor spelling mistakes.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

2621,"In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.
between generations, both from the point of view of the older generation.
The young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.
Both poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.
Margaret's love for her child is clearly genuine - the parents 'love' in the Duffy poem rings hollow.

2313,"An alloy is a mixture of two elements, one of which is a metal. Alloys often have properties that are different to the metals they contain. This makes them more useful than the pure metals alone. For example, alloys are often harder than the metal they contain.
Alloys contain atoms of different sizes, which distorts the regular arrangements of atoms. This makes it more difficult for the layers to slide over each other, so alloys are harder than the pure metal.
It is more difficult for layers of atoms to slide over each other in alloys
A summary of three common alloys, the metals they contain, and their typical uses
Smart alloys have unusual properties. Nitinol is an alloy of nickel and titanium, and is known as a shape memory alloy. If nitinol is bent out of shape, it returns to its original shape when it is either heated or an electric current is passed through it. This property makes it useful for making spectacle frames - they return to their original shape if they are put in hot water after bending them.

64,"If someone is cooking in the kitchen it doesn't take long for the smell to travel around the house to other rooms. This is because of diffusion.
When chemicals, like the smell of perfume or burning toast, are let loose in a room, the particles mix with the air particles. The particles of smelly gas are free to move quickly in all directions. They eventually spread through the whole room. This is called
You don't have to mix the gases by waving your arms around - it mixes on its own. Diffusion in gases is quick because the particles in a gas move quickly. It happens even faster in hot gases
Diffusion can also happen in liquids. This is because the particles in liquids can move around each other, which means that eventually they are evenly mixed.
For example if you drop a little bit of paint into a jar of water the colour will spread slowly through the water. This is by diffusion.
Diffusion in liquids is slower than diffusion in gases because the particles in a liquid move more slowly.
happen at all in solids because the particles in a solid can only vibrate on the spot, rather than being able to move from place to place.
Under pressure? See what happens when you cool down.

502,"Everything is made from atoms, including you. Atoms are tiny particles that are far too small to see, even with a microscope. If people were the same size as atoms, the entire population of the world would fit into a box about a thousandth of a millimetre across!
We usually imagine atoms as being like tiny balls:
To make diagrams simpler we often draw atoms as circles:
There are over a hundred different types of atom, and these are called
. Each element has a special name. For example carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are all elements.
Lead and gold are elements too. A piece of pure gold contains only gold atoms. A piece of pure lead contains only lead atoms.
Chemical reactions join or split atoms to rearrange them. But they cannot change one element into another element, or anything simpler. A chemical reaction cannot turn lead into gold, becuse it can't change the atoms into different elements.

Number patterns - Number patterns in diagrams
A number pattern in a diagram often requires counting shapes to find the rule. Again, look at how the pattern grows from one term to the next.
Pattern 1 has 0 orange tiles and 3 blue tiles, so 3 tiles altogether
Pattern 2 has 1 orange tiles and 5 blue tiles, so 6 tiles altogether
Pattern 3 has 2 orange tiles and 7 blue tiles, so 9 tiles altogether
Q1. Based on the number patterns above, draw pattern 4.
Q2. Look again at the number patterns above. Write the rule and the fourth terms for:
Pattern 4 has 3 orange tiles and 9 blue tiles, so 12 tiles altogether
a) The rule for the number pattern of orange tiles is 'add 1' and the 4th term is 3.
b) The rule for the number pattern of blue tiles is 'add 2' and the 4th term is 9.
c) The rule for the number pattern of all tiles is 'add 3' and the 4th term is 12.
Follow the rules and try this activity!

126,"> Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.

127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of time is explored, consider these points:
Montague and Benvolio discuss the ""ancient quarrel"" and how it escalated so swiftly because of the quick tempers of servants from each opposing family along with Tybalt's ""fiery"" reaction.
Time passes slowly for Romeo whilst he is in a bad mood. He hides himself away during the daytime.
Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline.
Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo.
Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day.
Can love happen so quickly? Maybe Romeo and Juliet have not considered the consequences of their relationship so it was bound to go wrong from the start. Or maybe this a classic example of love at first sight: sudden, powerful, and beyond the control.

46,"There are two different methods for finding the area of this shape:
Divide the shape into squares and rectangles, find their individual areas and then add them together.
Area = 16 + 16 + 48 = 80cm
Imagine the shape as a large rectangle with a section cut out.
Find the area of the large rectangle (12  8) and then subtract the part that has been cut out (4  4)
Area = (12  8) - (4  4) = 96 - 16 = 80cm
In the right area? Find out with this activity.

The Tempest second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - Characters
In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet.
It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet.
Romeo seemed to be in love with the idea of love, perhaps even more than he was in love with Rosaline. Apart from saying that she was beautiful, he wasn't very complimentary about her personality.
Romeo is besotted by Juliet; the fact that she is beautiful plays a big part.
Romeo loves the language of love. His speeches are full of confusing imagery as he tries to work out just exactly what love is.
Romeo tries to impress Juliet with his poetic descriptions about love. Juliet's words somehow seem more heartfelt than Romeo's clever poetry.
Montague and Benvolio discuss how moody Romeo has been lately. When he enters the scene, the audience can see for themselves how his mood can swing from despair to humour and back again.
Juliet is a deeply emotional person and is open about her feelings from the start. Romeo seems to get caught up in that wave of her emotion. They go from being complete strangers to committed lovers in a matter of hours.
Romeo stubbornly swears that he could never love anyone other than Rosalinebut as we see in the Second Key Extract, by the very next morning he is planning his wedding to Juliet.
Both characters make decisions quickly and take risks lightly. Romeo and Juliet could both be described as impulsive in their actions.

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

each other - they keep the same distance apart from each other.
When two lines intersect, the opposite (X) angles are equal:
On parallel lines, alternate (Z) angles are equal:
On parallel lines, corresponding (F) angles are equal:
On parallel lines, co-interior (C) angles add up to 180:
Lines of equal length are marked with
In the following diagram, DE is parallel to AC and AB = CB.
a) Find the size of angle a. Give a reason for your answer.
b) Find the size of angle c. Give a reason for your answer.
c) Find the size of angle b. Give a reason for your answer.
d) Find the size of angle e. Give a reason for your answer.
a) a = 40 (corresponding angle to angle at point D)
b) c = 40 (AB = CB, therefore angle a = angle c)
c) b = 100 (angles in a triangle add up to 180)
d) e = 140 (e and c are co-interior angles)

Changes in the environment - Regular changes
Most habitats do not stay the same all the time.
change from light and heat to dark and cold, as night falls
change from a high water level to a low water level, as the tide changes
change from hot weather in the summer to cold weather in the winter
change from long hours of daylight in the summer to shorter days in the winter
change from lots of vegetation in the summer to bare trees and snow-covered ground in the winter
Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes.
If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks.
When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves.
The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America.
The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.

Analyse, review and comment - Writing to analyse
When you are writing to analyse you tend to be quite distant - don't show your personal opinions and be detached from the conclusions you reach.
Some students feel that there is still too much unhealthy junk food in school. They want more healthy dishes. Others say they wouldn't eat the healthy food and would just bring in their own food or go out to the chip shop, which is out of bounds. We need a solution!
Write a speech, to be given at a School Governors' meeting, analysing the advantages and disadvantages of making school dinners healthier.
You have to forget about your own preferences. Be thoughtful and give a balanced view of the problem. You could start with ideas like these:
Better for us - will improve health and learning
Students won't go out of school for food
You must also come to a reasonable conclusion. Remember, it has to be a formal speech, that can provide a solution which will solve the problem.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The end
Meanwhile, in Mantua, Romeo waits for news. A servant called Balthasar arrives and tells Romeo that he has heard that Juliet has died. Romeo decides to buy some poison. He plans to go to see Juliet's body where he will take the poison and die next to her.
Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo.
That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate.
Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet.
When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies.
Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away.
Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself.
Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.

145,"Ratios are used in everyday life and can help you work out problems including scale drawings and reading maps.
In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion.
A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on.
a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat?
b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model?
The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat.
a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so:
b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model
so mast height on real boat  20 = mast height on model
400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm  20 =
Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map.
If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map.
How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life?
1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm.
To convert from cm to m, divide by 100.
To convert from m to km divide by 1000.
The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km?
5km = 5000m = 5000  100 cm = 500 000cm
We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life.
The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000
500 000  50 000 = 10

447,"The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you.
After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous.
Natalie shifted nervously. She didn't know quite where to look but she had to put on a front. The other three girls made no attempt to hide the fact that they were on Natalie's case. They began to whisper to each other and smile as they stared at her. Natalie felt illuminated in her green satins and began to wish she had chosen clothes which weren't so loud. What are they grinning at? she wondered. Is it my clothes? My shoes? My hair? Do I look too innocent? Suddenly the three girls began to walk toward Natalie. Her heart began to race, the palms of her hands began to sweat. She felt like falling apart but she held herself together.
'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag.
'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?'
The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars.
'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.'
At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?'
Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender.
'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces?
How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract?
her first reactions to the girls she sees
the way she acts just before, and when, they speak to her
her thoughts at the end of the passage.
Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight.
When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.

136,"> Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly.
Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them.
So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so
cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its

Introduction to equations - More complex equations
Sometimes an equation will have multiples of an unknown, eg, 5y = 20. To solve this you need to get the unknown on its own. To do this, divide both sides by 5.
5y  5 = 20  5
Sometimes an equation will have multiples of an unkown and other numbers, eg, 3x + 2 = 8
In equations of this type, your aim is to get all the 'x's (or unknowns) on one side and all the numbers on the other.
Let's solve the equation 3x + 2 = 8. We can show this in a picture like this, where each bag is an 'x'.
We want to get the 'x' on it's own. Start by subtracting 2 from both sides:
3x + 2 - 2 = 8 - 2
Solve the equation 4x - 5 = 3
Add 5 to both sides to give:

273,"> Tone and style - Avoid repetition
One quick way to improve your style is to avoid repeating words. Look for other choices. So instead of writing ""John was bullied"", you could change to ""picked on"" and instead of writing ""Satnam was the quickest runner"", you could alter this to ""the fastest"" or ""the best"" or ""the swiftest"" etc.
You might not realise you have repeated a word, so look back over your writing to see what you can change. An examiner won't mind you altering something if it will improve it.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Of course, it's fine to use the same word if you really want your readers to remember something. So if you are persuading them, you probably need to repeat your key ideas and key words.

539,"> Variation and classification - Genetic engineering
Variation in living organisms can also be created by
Using laboratory techniques scientists can alter the genetic code within the DNA of a living organism. They can add genes from a different species to an organism's DNA
For example, GM can be used to alter the DNA in a bacterium so that it produces insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly and used to help people suffering from diabetes.
Some people are concerned that there may be negative aspects to GM.
For example, there are people that believe GM is unethical and should be banned.
Other people are concerned that there may be unexpected long term problems of using GM, producing changes that could not be reversed. Such changes could create new pathogens or ""superweeds"" by the GM organisms breeding with other species. This could cause the natural balance of living organisms in the environment to be upset.

421,"Questioning is an important skill that shows your teacher that you are listening carefully. There are two main types of questions.
These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female?
These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher?
You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question:
""What exactly do you mean by that?""
Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant:
""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?""
For their Speaking and Listening assessment, Matt has been paired with Tim. Matt has to interview Tim about his favourite character in the play, Romeo and Juliet. Tim is really shy and hates speaking. To get good marks himself, Matt knows that he has to encourage Tim to speak too.
Can you spot the listening skills that Matt uses to help Tim?
Why do you like him better than say, one of the main characters, like Romeo?
He's not so much of a show off.
Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo?
Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth.
Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies?
(Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose. I just meant that I like Benvolio because he's the only one that just tries to get by without getting into trouble.

614,"Election Day is only a couple of weeks away, and the presidential candidates are very busy. They are traveling around the United States asking people to vote for them in the presidential election.
George W. Bush agreed to answer questions about himself in writing. Here's what he had to tell the kids of the United States.
: Tell us about someone who is a hero to you and why that person is a hero.
: My parents [are my heroes] because they gave me unconditional love when I was growing up. They were great role models for raising my own daughters.
: What was your favorite subject in school and why?
: American and European history [were my favorites]. I believe that understanding the past helps us better understand and deal with situations happening in today's world.
: What do you think is the biggest change between being a kid when you were growing up and being a kid now?
: I think life was simpler when I was a kid growing up in a small west Texas town called Midland. We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it.
: Your father, George Bush, was president. What is it like to have a former president as a dad?
: My father is a wonderful role model and a loving dad, and his example has inspired me in many ways. My father taught me to appreciate and learn from history. By studying the careers of talented Americans who entered government, I learned that dedicated public servants can help people.
: Why do you want to be president?
: I want to be president because I want America to be a place where every child is loved and educated and where every one of our citizens is able to achieve his or her greatest potential.

115,"Who gets burger bragging rights? A meaty battle is sizzling among three states over the history of the hamburger. In Texas, lawmaker Betty Brown proposed a bill declaring Athens, Texas, the home of the hamburger. Wisconsin has also jumped into the food fight. State Representative Tom Wilson argues that Seymour, Wisconsin, is the place where the famous sandwich was invented.
Not so fast, say the owners of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. Established in 1895, the restaurant is maintaining its claim as the burger birthplace. ""It's a well-known and established fact that New Haven is the home of the hamburger,"" says New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. ""In fact, New Haven's claim to the hamburger is even supported and documented in the Library of Congress.""

86,"Plans for an African-American history museum in Washington, D.C., have been in the works for more than a year. Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET).
The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money.
President George W. Bush authorizes the creation of a Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history and culture.
The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present.
""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members. The museum is expected to open in 2013.

484,"A new leopard species is found in Indonesia.
Scientists have ""spotted"" a new jungle cat. The previously unknown species of clouded leopard has been roaming the rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. The secretive leopards are the latest of at least 52 new plant and animal species found in the rain forests on Borneo within the past year.
Scientists compared Borneo's clouded leopards with similar cats found on Southeast Asia's mainland. They paid special attention to the marks on the animals' skin. ""The moment we started comparing the skins on the mainland clouded leopard and the leopard found on Borneo, it was clear we were comparing two different species,"" says scientist Andrew Kitchener. Unlike the mainland clouded leopard, the Borneo cat has a double
(back) stripe and distinct spots within its small cloud markings. The Borneo leopard also has darker fur than that of the mainland species.
The newly discovered leopard is Borneo's largest
or hunter. It can grow as large as a small panther and has the longest teeth relative to body size of any cat.
There are about 5,000 to 11,000 Borneo clouded leopards living on Borneo, according to scientists. The Sumatra population is likely to be between 3,000 and 7,000.
Habitat destruction threatens Borneo's wildcats. Scientists have called for increased conservation or protection, of the rain forest habitat on Borneothe world's thirdlargest island.

363,"The Candidates Speak Out on the Environment
Americans have a common interest in protecting our natural lands. As president, I will speak for that great national goal
George W. Bush wants to establish a national award to recognize people who help the environment. He also wants to give money to help landowners protect rare species and wants to set up private land preserves.
I'm an environmentalist, and I want to protect the environment--the air, the water, and the land, and the Earth itself

Recently, Gero completed work for the movie
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
, which opens in theaters June 4. His team, which included six trainers for this movie, worked with dozens of animals. Their lineup for the film included cats, dogs, owls, rats, crows-and even a hippo!

To train the animals, Gero and his team reward them with food and praise when they follow instructions correctly. Owls may get a reputation for being wise, but Gero knows differently. Gero told

365,"Being bullied is all too familiar to 12-year-old Drew Landry from Maine. When he was in sixth grade last year, Drew was bullied by an eighth grader. ""It was hard to get through,"" Drew told
With the help of his parents and school officials, the bullying has stopped.
Drew is not alone. More than 16 percent of U.S. school children report having been bullied, a recent survey shows. As a result, many states across the country are passing anti-bullying laws.
At least 22 states have enacted anti-bullying laws since 1999. However, many Maine law makers said those laws were not tough enough. As a result, Maine passed a new law that requires school officials to develop stricter policies to deal with bullying. Teachers must also be trained to deal with bullies.
is someone who picks on another person again and again. Many kids think of bullying as hitting or pushing, but it is more than that. Bullying often takes the form of name-calling, leaving someone out of a game or a group on purpose, teasing, threatening, and spreading rumors.
Bullying isn't limited to the schoolyard. Bullies today have new turfcyberspace. Online bullies often use e-mail, instant messages, and blogs to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids.
After his tough experience, Drew wants to make sure no other kids are bullied. He spoke in front of Maine lawmakers to support the new law. ""I helped change the law to help other kids feel better about themselves,"" he says. ""It makes me feel [safer].""
What is Drew's advice to other kids who are bullied? ""Don't be afraid to tell an adult.""
If you are being bullied, you can do something about it. Here are three tips from the National Center for School Safety.
No! If you are being bullied, tell the bully in a firm voice that you do not like what he or she is doing.

617,"Sierra Negra erupts on the Galpagos Islands for the first time in 26 years.
Tortoises and other unique wildlife are safe after a volcano erupts on the Galpagos Islands.
RED ALERT Sierra Negra erupts on the Galpagos Islands for the first time in 26 years.
The Galpagos Islands are home to wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. Here, the islands famous giant tortoises and other unique wildlife roam freely. People were worried that those wildlife were harmed after a volcano on Isabela, the largest of the Galpagos Islands, erupted.
The nearly mile-high volcano, called Sierra Negra, sent three scorching rivers of
pouring down the mountainside toward the Pacific Ocean. Lava is red-hot, molten rock that comes out of a volcano. (See
The three lava flows, however, were not a threat to the people or the plants and animals on Isabela, according to island officials. ""The situation is not risky,"" confirms Pablo Gordillo, the mayor of a small village on the island.
The Galpagos Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean. They rest about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, a country in South America. The
(ar-kuh- PEH-luh-goh), or small group of islands, belongs to Ecuador. In 1835, scientist Charles Darwin arrived on the islands aboard a ship called the Beagle. He spent weeks investigating the areas diverse plants and animals.(See
A volcano is a mountain with an opening on top. When a volcano is active,
(hot, liquid rock) deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure causes magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the
or openings, at the top and sides of the volcano. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called
Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Tourist centers near the active volcano were closed as a safety measure during the volcanic eruptions. But visitors to the island could still get a sneak peak. ""We have opened an observation post near the site for tourists so that visitors can observe this natural spectacle,"" says Gordillo.
A giant tortoise and a colorful frigate bird inhabit Galpagos island.
Scientist Charles Darwin was fascinated that each small island on the Galpagos had its own distinct species of tortoises, lizards, and birds.
are huge turtles that weigh up to 500 pounds and can live up to 150 years.
are large lizards that can weigh up to 15 pounds. These slow movers live in drier parts of the islands.

663,"Why do some books make people angry?
How would you feel if your favorite book was yanked from library shelves? Beginning September 23, the American Library Association (ALA) observes Banned Books Week. When a book is banned, it is removed from a library or a school. Many people say that banning books goes against the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech. People who challenge books often claim that they want to protect others from dangerous ideas. Weve piled up some well-known titles that have been challenged.

610,"History in the Making: Japan Invades Hong Kong
War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. An undeclared war was fought until 1941, when China, as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, declared war on Japan, Germany, and Italy. In 1941, Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong, which is part of present-day China. Connie interviewed her grandfather, Locksley Siu, who was in Hong Kong during the Japanese invasion.
How old were you when World War II began?
World War II in Hong Kong was from 1941 to 1945. The Japanese army occupied the former British colony when I was 11 years old.
Where did you live, and did you have a car?
Altogether, eight people lived in [an] apartment of 500 square feet. Our apartment was in Wan Chai, on Hong Kong Island. Most people did not have cars. My dad had an old bicycle.
Did you still go to school during the Japanese occupation?
Yes, I continued to go to school for the first year. Later the school was closed because the school ran out of money. During the occupation, students were required to learn Japanese. Japanese teachers taught us Japanese.
Did you have enough food to eat every day?
No, we did not have enough food. We only ate vegetables, beans, and potatoes, but no rice at all. Meat was very costly and in short supply. When we were really hungry, we drank water. Sometimes we had to pick up grass and leaves from trees to eat.
How did the Japanese soldiers treat the Chinese people?
They were rude, and they hated Chinese people. We had to salute the Japanese soldiers when they passed by. Otherwise they would kick [us] in the back.
How was life affected by the occupation?
There was little freedom. The Japanese forbade people to go out after 11 at night. There was no traffic during the curfew. There was a lack of electricity for lighting; instead, we used candles. The only entertainment at night was the radio. The Japanese government took all Hong Kong dollars away. The Japanese government forced us to use Japanese yen. Roads such as Queen's Road and King's Road were changed to Japanese names.
Do you have any comments about the occupation?
More than 60 years after [the end of] World War II, there are still many people  who live in fear, hunger, and poverty because of wars. I hope that you will think more of those less fortunate.
I learned that there was little freedom under the occupation. I should be grateful that I live in a country where I am not forced to do things that I don't want to do. I'm going to do something for the less fortunate, just as my grandpa told me.

524,"Think about something you want to find out about your family. For example, you could ask each family member, What is your favorite (or least favorite) dinner? What is your favorite TV show? How much time do you spend in the bathroom? (Make sure the question has only two possible answers, such as yes or no.)
Once you have your question, write it in the space below. When you approach the person you want to poll, explain what you are doing, write down the person's name, and ask the question. Then write the answer next to the person's name.

632,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a group of tiny people inhabited caves on a remote tropical island in Indonesia. That is a country that lies between Asia and Australia. The little people made stone tools to spear giant rats and hunted large lizards and tiny elephants in packs.
Believe it or not, this is no fairy tale. Inside a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, scientists discovered the bones of seven people who belonged to a new
, or type, of human. The most intact skeleton was that of a child-sized adult female.
""If you told me an alien spacecraft had landed on Flores, I would have been less surprised than by this discovery,"" said Peter Brown, one of the scientists behind the rare find.
The miniature humans had bulging eyes and brains that were no bigger than those of newborn babies. Standing barely 3 feet tall, an adult was about the size of a 3-year-old child today.
Their tiny size earned them the nickname ""hobbits."" That name comes from the dwarflike creatures that appear in books by
What is even more amazing about the scientists' discovery is that the small humans lived as recently as 13,000 years ago. That may seem very long ago to you, but modern humans existed at the same time.
Did the newly discovered hobbits and modern humans live on Flores together? Scientists estimate that modern humans reached the island more than 35,000 years ago. Whether the two groups interacted remains a mystery, but scientists hope the discovery will teach them more about the history of humans.

517,"Meet a monkey with a Mohawk! Scientists recently discovered the unusual-looking creature with spiked hair in the mountains of Tanzania, a country located in East Africa. It is Africa's first new
or type, of monkey to be identified in 20 years.
The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

90,"More than a million Lego blocks are donated to New Orleans.
Anthony Comeau, 10, loves his Lego building blocks. When he heard that students in schools in New Orleans, Louisiana, had no Legos, Anthony decided to
or contribute, some of his own building blocks. ""It's nice to have something to play with in school during free time, so I was happy to give to other kids,"" the fifth grader told
Anthony is just one of thousands of children who donated more than 800,000 Lego blocks to the Lego Brick Drive last year. The collection was organized by the Lego company to help schools in New Orleans. Many of the schools were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Children in every state made donations. Anthony's schoolRye Elementary School in Rye, New Hampshiredonated more than 7,000 Lego bricks! The Lego company made a brick-for-brick matching donation. Altogether, more than 1.6 million Legos were given to New Orleans schools.
At a ceremony in November, Lego artist Nathan Sawaya presented his Lego structure of New Orleans. He built the structure using ideas from students who donated building blocks. ""Their suggestions inspired me to create a fun, colorful structure of Lego bricks that symbolizes a bright future for the children of New Orleans,"" Sawaya told

713,"National program is launched to erase head lice from schools.
An adult head louse is about the size of a sesame seed.
Spiders and bats may spook you, but nothing will make your skin crawl more than head lice. Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. Many of those affected are school kids.
Head lice outbreaks are the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against lice. The group is launching a program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
The tiny bugs, each about the size of a sesame seed, spread quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant fly, but they can crawl.
Experts say the most common way to catch lice is through head-to-head contact. Lice can also be spread through the sharing of personal items such as hats, scarves, headphones, barrettes, and combs.
Head lice dont discriminate. They like everybody equally. It doesnt matter how often a person showers or bathes. Health experts say to follow these tips to keep the bugs from making your head their home.
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items with your friends or classmates.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.

573,"Wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster.
The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly
, or leave, their homes to escape the fire's destructive path. Many families lost their homes and belongings in the fires. At least 22 people died as a result of the fires.
President Bush declared several southern California counties disaster areas. Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger will work with officials to help homeowners and businesses rebuild.
Government officials say the wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster. They estimate rebuilding efforts will cost more than $2 billion.

498,"Sixth grader Haley Small loves to wear a T-shirt, flip-flops, and pajama bottoms. But Haley doesnt wear her comfy pjs just for sleeping or lounging around the house. She wears them in publiceven to school.
Whats the appeal of pajamas? ""Part of it is because its cute, but the majority of it is because its comfortable,"" says the 11-yearold from Glen Rock, New Jersey. Haley often wears her pajamas to school because theyre more comfortable than jeansand so she can sleep an extra five minutes in the morning.
Haley isnt the only student parading around in pajamas in public. Sleepwearin plaids, stripes, and animal printsis popping up in schools across the country.
Boys are also following the trend, wearing elastic-waist or drawstring pants topped with T-shirts. Some kids are even shuffling down the school hallways in their slippers!
Pajamas may be the latest fashion trend, but they are not popular with everyone. School officials from Michigan to California have banned bedtime clothes from class. Take a look at both sides of the pj debate.
Some supporters think that school officials are dreamingkids do not need to get dressed up to learn. People who are pro pajamas say a ban limits students freedom of expression and creativity.
Haley agrees that one day she may need to dress up, but right now pajamas are fine by her. She says that school isnt a job and that wearing pajamas suits her personality. ""Im not a very dressed-up person myself,"" she adds. ""If you found me in a skirt, that would be amazing.""
Many principals and teachers say that sleepwear has no place in school. They argue that kids go to school to learn, and the casual trend
, or takes attention away, from learning. Ohio school official Gene Harris says pajamas set a bad example because students who dress for play ""want to play.""
Principal Shelly Fagenstrom from Great Falls, Montana, agrees. She has banned pajama wearing at her school. ""This isnt a sleepover,"" says Fagenstrom. ""Its school.""

787,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's
Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters.
Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters.
As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top
. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami.
Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were
, or separated, from white people in the South.
Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado.
Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice.
The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch.
The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.

15,"Car tires have been rolling through the news. The news is that experts believe Firestone tires have a
, or problem, that is causing the tires to burst. Bursting tires may have caused many car accidents.
As a result of the possible defect, 6.5 million Firestone tires are being taken off cars and thrown away. But what happens to old tires?
Each year, Americans throw away 276 million tires. About 70 percent of those tires are
, or made into other things. Many of those tires are shredded and pressed together to make surfaces for playgrounds. Kids could be playing on surfaces made from tires that your family threw away.

371,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.

189,"A Pennsylvania man collected more than one million pennies.
A Pennsylvania man got more than a penny for his thoughts. After 40 years of pinching (or saving) pennies, Lynn Wagner decided it was time to cash them in at the bank.
Wagner collected more than a million pennies in all. Over the years, he stored the pennies in 41 / 2-gallon buckets in his garage. After several bank visits to cash in 37 buckets of coins, Wagner came home with about $10,060 in paper money!
How did he become so penny-wise? ""I thought that it'd be interesting to have a million [pennies],"" he said.
According to Wagner, if all his pennies were stacked end to end, they would be 4,600 feet high. That is about four times as tall as the Empire State Building, in New York City.
Wagner admits that spending pennies is now hard for him to do. That could be because he knows how to make every penny count. As his wife points out, ""Some people think that pennies don't add up to anything, but this is proof that they do.""

658,"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years.
The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

215,"Brothers Kenneth Galeano, 12, and Branden Galeano, 7, were the first students to walk through the doors at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School. They were greeted with welcome signs and big smiles. Ben Franklin is the first public school in New Orleans to reopen since Hurricane Katrina hit four months ago.
""This signals that school is up and running, and thats a good thing,"" says Heidi Daniels, a school board member. ""This will help people return to a sense of normalcy."" At least 10 more public schools are expected to reopen in coming weeks.

182,"Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools?
If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.
Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote at
According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their
, or loyalty to the country. ""Our school board has long supported [the pledge] as an appropriate patriotic exercise for willing students,"" says Steven Ladd, the superintendent from one of the California school districts affected by the ruling.
Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is
. Kids don't have to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.

712,"A series of earthquakes strike the island nation.
People are recovering after a series of earthquakes rocked the Indonesian island of Sumatra in Southeast Asia. On March 6, a 6.3-magnitude quake destroyed dozens of buildings, killed at least 70 people, and injured hundreds of others. It was followed by several
or smaller earthquakes. The quakes sent people running from their homes in search of safety.
""We all just fled as quickly as we could,"" an Indonesian worker told reporters. The worker was in the seaside town of Padang when the ground began to move. Padang is just a few miles southwest of the
of the earthquake. The epicenter is the area above the underground point where the earthquake begins.
Many people living near the ocean ran for higher ground during the tremors. They feared that the earthquake would trigger giant waves similar to the devastating tsunami that hit southern Asia and eastern Africa in 2004. That disaster was caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean off Sumatra. Fortunately, the March earthquake was not powerful enough to cause a similar disaster.
The earthquake was strong enough to topple buildings inland. The town of Solok suffered the most damage. Hospitals there ran out of beds for injured people. Cots were set up for patients being treated for cuts and broken bones.
The islands that make up Indonesia are located along the
That is an area along the edge of the Pacific Ocean where Earth's tectonic plates push against each other, often causing earthquakes and volcanoes. In parts of Indonesia, an average of five earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5 occur each year.

266,"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?
have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

722,"Educators spread the word about slavery in the North.
Sojourner Truth is best known as an outspoken
someone who worked to end slavery. But what people may not know is that Truth was one of thousands of slaves in the United States who were bought, sold, and forced to do labor in the North.
""Many people are surprised when you talk about slavery in the North,"" Alan Singer, a professor of education at Hofstra University, told
""We associate slavery with the South, even though the biggest importer of slavesafter South Carolinawas New York City.""
Singer and other educators spread the word about slavery in the North. Although there were fewer slaves in the North than in the South, slavery flourished in New York City, northern New Jersey, rural Pennsylvania, and the shipping towns of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1771, slaves made up about 12 percent of the population of New York City.
Some slaves in the North were offered freedom to fight for the British during the Revolutionary War (17751783). However, slavery wasnt abolished in the United States until the end of the Civil War (18611865). New Jersey, for example, reported 18 slaves in 1860.
Singer explains that the slave trade helped support the
in many major Northern cities, such as Boston and New York City. The Industrial Revolution was a rapid change in the economy in the 1800s, when factories and powerdriven machines were introduced. Many U.S. businesses got their start with profits from the slave trade and slave-produced goods.
Singer tells students that the effects of slavery linger today through racial prejudice and discrimination. ""Kids see slavery as something that happened in the deep past. I want children to know that we still live with the effects of that slavery society.""
Isabella Baumfree (17971883) was born one of 13 children but never got to know her siblings because they were sold into slavery. She was emancipated, or freed, in 1828.

259,"Aochan, a rat snake, and Gohan, a dwarf hamster, are an unlikely pair of friends. The two share a cage at a zoo in Tokyo, Japan. Zookeepers placed the hamster, whose name is Japanese for ""meal,"" in the snakes cage as a tasty snack. Instead of chowing down on Gohan, the snake befriended the furry rodent.

271,"Do you know the words to the Pledge of Allegiance by heart? If you're like most kids in the United States, you probably have said those words countless times.
Now the pledge has found itself in a firestorm of controversy. Next year, the Supreme Court will decide whether to ban the phrase ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools.
Last year, a federal appeals court in California ruled that the pledge is
because it contains the phrase ""under God.""
If something does not uphold the principles of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
According to this lower court, the words ""under God"" suggest the government
, or supports, religion. That violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to this freedom as the separation of church and state.
The court's decision affects nearly 10 million schoolchildren in nine western states. The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States.
Michael Newdow of California brought the case to court. He argued that his daughter, now in the fourth grade, should not have to listen to the pledge recited daily, because of its reference to God. ""I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution,"" he told CNN.
The Elk Grove School District in Sacramento, California, didn't agree. In response, the school district asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn the lower court's ruling.
The Pledge of Allegiance, written by Francis Bellamy, is published in a Boston magazine called
On Columbus Day, about 12 million American schoolchildren say the pledge for the first time.
The words ""my Flag"" are changed to ""the flag of the United States."" A year later, ""of America"" is added to the end of that sentence.
Congress approves the addition of the words ""under God.""
National outrage followed the lower court's decision. To many Americans, saying the pledge is a way to express their
President Bush supports keeping the phrase ""under God"" in the pledge. A spokesperson for the president argues that the phrase is more about history than about religion.
The official points out that there are religious references in the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem. The nation's money carries the motto ""In God We Trust,"" as well.
Once the case begins next year, the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., will likely be the scene of protests. People on both sides of the debate will want their voices heard.
Until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling, the ban on the pledge has been put on hold. But as critics of the lower court's decision argue, reciting the pledge remains
. That means that schoolchildren are not required to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.

364,"Should schools report a student's health to parents?
As if grades weren't enough to worry about, some students now have weight on their minds too. The number of overweight children in the United States has more than doubled in the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Being
or severely overweight, can lead to health problems later in life.
As a result, schools in several states, from California to Pennsylvania, have started sending home ""BMI report cards."" Those schools send home a report of a student's
BMI is a calculation of weight and height that tells whether a person is overweight for his or her age.
Should schools send home BMI reports? People on both sides of the debate are weighing in.
Some lawmakers say BMI reports alert parents to their children's health and help combat obesity. In 2003, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee helped launch the first program to report students' BMIs. Obesity rates in that state have since stopped increasing. Pediatrician Joe Thompson helped plan the BMI program for Arkansas schools. He explains that the reports in Arkansas are sent home separately from report cards. ""The misconception is students are being graded on their weight,"" he told
""Just like a school screens for vision or hearing, this is a health approach to raise awareness about a risk.""
Not everyone thinks that reporting students' BMIs is a good idea. Parents have complained that the reports damage their children's self-esteem. Some parents say kids also worry that they are being ""graded"" on their weight. Opponents of BMI reports argue that schools that label students overweight are acting unfairly. The critics point out that many school cafeterias serve fatty foods. Parent Brett Levy from Chicago, Illinois, believes that schools should teach kids to lead healthy lifestyles instead of reporting their BMIs. ""Telling a boy or girl [a] BMI is not education,"" he told
Schools should issue BMI reports for students.
Schools should not issue BMI reports for students.

121,"New York City Subway: Then and Now
New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is a billionaire who could take a limousine to work. Instead, he rides the subway to his office at City Hall each morning.
""A hundred years ago, a generation of New Yorkers had the courage and conviction to build a subway system that transformed our city,"" said Mayor Bloomberg. ""Today our subway is the backbone of New York.""
On October 27, 2004, New York City marked the
, or hundredth anniversary, of its subway system with special ceremonies. As part of the celebration, people took tours to retrace the original 9.1-mile route from City Hall to Harlem.
Construction began on the subway in 1900 and took 12,000 workers four years to complete. At that time, the population of New York City was 3.4 million and growing. People, horse-drawn carriages, trolleys, and vendors packed city streets.

City officials believed that a subway system would help people get around faster and allow them to move into outer areas. What started out as one subway line with 28 stations has grown into 26 lines with 468 stations. A fare in 1904 cost only a nickel. Today, about 4.5 million people ride the subway daily and pay $2 a ride.
The subway has seen plenty of change since 1904. Over the years, workers have restored many old subway stations. They have found mosaics and murals hidden under dirt.
Public artwork now graces 140 subway stations as part of the Art for Transit program. ""You can probably say that the New York subway system is one of the largest art museums in the world,"" Roxanne Robertson of the New York Transit Museum told

173,"Marco Andretti is on the fast track to success.
Speed runs in Marco Andrettis family. His grandfather, Mario, and father, Michael, are two of the best-known race car drivers of all time. Now 19-year-old Marco is taking his place behind the wheel. He recently finished his first season as a driver for the Andretti Green Racing team. He placed second in this years Indianapolis 500, finishing ahead of his father. Marco also won the Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma (California). He recently slowed down long enough to talk to
So, how fast do you actually go?
[My] top speed [is] 240 [miles per hour].
How did you get started in racing?
I started at 9 years old. So its go-karts. Believe it or not, those things arent toys. It gets pretty competitive. The first time I ever sat in a go-kart, I was just going to have a go and see basically if I had it or not. Of course, the media was everywhere. There were so many cameras there, I couldnt even see the track.
How did you deal with all the attention at such a young age?
It was very overwhelming. I got to the point where I was winning races, but I wasnt enjoying myself. I would win a race and come away from the day saying thats what I needed to do, rather than enjoy it. I just took a little time off and then went crazy not driving, so I had to come back for myself.
What dont you like about coming from such a famous racing family?
You have a lot expected of you because of all their accomplishments, but Im just going to go have fun with it. You set your own goals.
How did it feel to pass your father in the Indy 500?

786,"Heather Lindaman from upstate New York won't be playing dodgeball anytime soon. In 2001, Heather, then 7 years old, was playing dodgeball in gym class when she fell, slamming into a hardwood floor and breaking her elbow.
After Heather's injury, her parents brought a case to court against the school. They argued that dodgeball is too dangerous for young kids to play in school. A New York court is currently hearing the case. Based on the court's decision, the school may decide whether the game should be
To play dodgeball, one team's members must hit opposing players with a large rubber ball to eliminate them from the game. The team with players left in the game wins.
Some schools in Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, Virginia, Texas, and Utah have already banned dodgeball or versions of the game. Some of those versions include war ball, monster ball, and kill game.
The National Association for Sport and Physical Education agrees that dodgeball does not belong in schools. That organization is made up of 20,000 gym teachers, coaches, and trainers. ""Dodgeball is not an appropriate activity for K-12 school physical education programs,"" the group told reporters.
Members of the association argue that dodgeball promotes violence and is unfair. They say that the game encourages bullying because stronger kids target weaker ones.
Don't toss dodgeball to the sidelines, say others. Nick Troy is a director with the National Amateur Dodgeball Association. Although his group is not connected with schools, he points out that the game has benefits.
""Dodgeball develops hand-eye coordination, strengthens muscles, and builds concentration skills,"" Troy told
. ""It is also a good form of exercise.""
Should dodgeball be thrown out of school?
Troy and others argue that dodgeball is no more dangerous than other school sports that kids play. Troy also disagrees that smaller kids are at a disadvantage. ""The goal isn't necessarily to get the weakest player out,"" he said. ""It's to get the best player out.""

235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

745,"William Jefferson Clinton is the 42nd president of the United States. He has been the president since 1993. He will leave office when the next president takes the oath of office on January 20, 2001. Recently, Bill Clinton answered questions from
What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

784,"North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia.
Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.
Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.

128,"More than 1,000 years ago, the Maya lived in part of what is now Central America and southern Mexico. They built huge pyramids and large temples. They studied astronomy and developed a calendar. Then for unknown reasons, the Maya disappeared.
Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called
, which are a kind of picture writing.
Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A long war caused the Maya civilization to decline.

654,"On November 2, voters will decide whom they want to be the next U.S. president. Will it be Republican George W. Bush or Democrat John Kerry? To find out what the candidates have to say about some of the election issues,
President George W. Bush is the Republican candidate.
Senator John Kerry is the Democratic candidate.
How do you plan to create a cleaner environment?
My administration has put in place some of the most important antipollution policies in a decade. I have a responsibility as the president to put people in my administration [who] understand the importance of conserving our natural resources and making them better.
As Americans, we have the right to breathe unpolluted air and drink safe water. Across America, we will guarantee all children access to clean, safe parks and baseball fields and take on traffic congestion. We will protect the health of all Americans by [improving air quality].
Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
What will you do to make sure kids in the United States get the best education possible?
I believe every child can learn and every school must teach--so we passed the most important federal education [law] in history. Because we acted, children are making progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back.
Every child should be held to high standards. Every classroom should have a great teacher. Every young person should graduate [from] high school, and every young person who works hard and wants to go to college should be able to afford it.
What is your vision for the future of Iraq?
We're working closely with Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, as they move toward free elections and take increasing responsibility for their own affairs. Securing democracy in Iraq is the work of many hands.
Our military performed brilliantly in ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Having gone to war, we cannot afford to fail at peace. The United States must take immediate measures to prevent Iraq from becoming a failed state.
Although the presidential candidates have been in the spotlight, they aren't the only people running for office on Election Day. On November 2, Americans will also vote to elect members to
Congress is the branch of the U.S. government that makes the laws. It is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Just like the presidential candidates, most senators and representatives belong to either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.
The winners of the Senate and House elections can affect the balance of power between the two main political parties in Congress. That can impact which laws get passed.
All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for election this year. Representatives are elected to two-year terms. There is no limit to how many times they can run for reelection. Republicans have a 12-seat lead in the House. They have held the majority in Congress since 1994.
In the U.S. Senate, 34 of the 100 seats are up for election. Every state has two senators, who are elected for six-year terms. There is also no limit on how many terms a senator can serve. The Republican Party has a one-seat lead in the Senate.

205,"You've probably sat at a desk or on a bench on which someone had carved or scratched a message. Etching, or carving, messages is nothing new, however. People have been carving and painting messages on rock walls for thousands of years.
Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old.
The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling.
Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

747,"Students are spending more time studying at home, but is that a good thing?
Homework is on the rise! Nine- to 12-year-olds are spending 20 percent more time studying at home than they spent in 1997, according to a recent study from the University of Maryland. ""Kids spend an average of 50 minutes to 75 minutes studying every day,"" says the studys author, Sandra L. Hofferth.
But is taking schoolwork home a good thing? Two recent books have education experts asking, is homework helpful?
writers Nancy Kalish and Sara Bennett write that homework keeps kids from participating in school sports and other after-school programs. ""Its the youngest kids who seem to be getting the most homework,"" Bennett told
""and theyre the least ready to do it.""
that ""no scientific studies have shown that kids
from homework in any way before high school."" (
means ""to receive help."") Kohn thinks that too much homework can take the fun out of learning.
Many education officials say homework is good for learning. ""Its important [for kids] to get used to doing homework,"" Harris Cooper of Duke University told
Cooper is one of the countrys leading researchers on homework. He says practicing homework now will help kids in high school. Cooper suggests that students should expect to do 40 minutes of homework each day.
Many teachers see the value of homework as well. ""I think homework is helpful to most kids. It gives them more responsibility,"" fourth-grade teacher Pepper Schrock of Orlando, Florida, told
""I try to give meaningful projects as homework.""

451,"The 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will be a place of many firsts. The Games, which start on September 15, are the first Olympic Games to take place in the 21st century. And, for the first time in Olympic history, people will hear such words as

The athletes who compete in the newly admitted Olympic sports are very excited about going to Sydney. ""It is an awesome feeling, and I don't even know how to explain it."" said Barbara Kunkel. Kunkel is a member of the U.S. tae kwon do team.
A sport must meet certain rules to become a part of the Olympic Games. Leaders of a sport must apply to be a part of the Olympics seven years before the sport can be included in any Olympic Games.
In addition, a men's sport must be ""widely practiced in at least 75 countries,"" and a women's sport must be practiced ""in at least 40 countries and on three continents.""
The United States is sending more than 200 athletes to the Games in Sydney. Those athletes are competing against athletes from more than 190 nations.
Other Summer Olympic events include track and field, swimming, baseball, and sailing.

236,"Imagine getting to star alongside Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the rest of the Looney Toons gang. Actor Brendan Fraser got that chance! Fraser, known for his roles in
, joins Bugs and Daffy on a wild adventure in the upcoming movie
The film hits theaters nationwide on November 14.
caught up with Fraser to ask him about starring in a movie with the famous cartoon characters:
What made you decide to take this role?
To star alongside such greats as Bugs Bunny and the whole cast of toons was an easy decision. But don't tell Daffy. It will go to his head!
: Did you watch Looney Toons on television when you were growing up?
Every Saturday morning! I used to get sent to the principal's office for doing my impression of the Tasmanian Devil in class. Now the director let me do Taz in the movie. Aaaah, revenge is sweet!
: What was the best part of acting in this movie?
Having to imagine that you're in a cartoon world is no easy task. I loved the challenge of believing I was alongside the characters each day.

151,"or the NBA playoffs? The TV-Turnoff Network wants you to do just thatand imagine what you can do instead of watching TV.
As a result, the theme of TV-Turnoff Week is ""Imagine."" The celebration takes place from April 24 to April 30. During the weeklong event, TV-Turnoff officials hope to raise awareness about the harmful effects of too much television.
Each American watches, on average, more than four hours of television per day, according to RealVision and the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!
Experts say that too much time in front of the TV can have a negative effect on children. Kids dont do as well in school and dont get enough exercise to stay in shape.
Robert Kesten, executive director of the TV-Turnoff Network, hopes that kids will turn off the television and get involved with other interests. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Kesten told
""We think kids will be surprised with the new discoveries they will make if they choose to shut off the TV for a week.""

629,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Is your backpack weighing you down? If so, consider lightening your load. A recent study shows that lugging around a bulky backpack that doesn't fit correctly can lead to poor
If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve.
Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain.
Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks.
The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt.
Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told
An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture.
When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body.
However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden!
Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Use both shoulder straps and fasten the waist strap to balance the weight evenly.
Adjust the shoulder straps so that the backpack is close to your body.
Pack only what you need and place the heaviest items closest to the center of your back.
What are other ways you can help improve your posture?
That means you should bend at the knees when you pick up your backpack.

481,"Archaeologists in northwestern England are thrilled about a rare find. The scientists recently unearthed a burial site of six Viking men and women. They discovered swords, spears, jewelry, and other artifacts.
This copper brooch belonged to one of the Vikings.
, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England.
The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.
Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also
, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold.
For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow
that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished.
The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America.
The Vikings traveled to other parts of Europe, the Mediterranean, Greenland, and North America.
One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492.
Longships varied in size, but many were between 60 feet and 90 feet in length.
A larger ship could carry about 50 raiders at a time.
Strong winds allowed a longship, which had one large sail, to reach speeds of up to 17 miles an hour.
Vikings used multiple oars to row the ship when there was no wind.
The front end of a longship curved upward and was adorned with a wood carving of a snake's or a dragon's head.
Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America.
Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement.
Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old.""

243,"A new study shows that kids who have a TV in their bedrooms get less sleep than other kids. Sleep experts at Brown University say about 30 percent of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.
According to sleep experts, kids who have TVs in their bedrooms go to bed later, have problems going to sleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night than kids who don't have TVs in their rooms.

714,"reported on a bill that would impose a 5-cent deposit on cigarettes sold in Maine. Members of a committee in the Maine legislature recently voted to snuff out the bill, making it unlikely that the bill will become law. If the bill had become law, it would have increased the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.
State Rep. Joseph Brooks, who introduced the bill, said he was disappointed by the vote. Brooks had proposed the bill to cut down on litter and to raise money to pay for antismoking education programs in Maine's schools. He also had hoped that the increased cost would have caused some smokers to stop smoking cigarettes.

193,"Children find open arms in new schools after Hurricane Katrina.
as she watched heavy rains and high winds rip through her hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 9-year-old had been getting ready to start fourth grade. Her brother, Terren, had arranged his school supplies in his backpack to prepare for his first day of second grade. But Hurricane Katrina prevented schools in New Orleans from opening.
When New Orleans flooded, Tenisha and her family headed 350 miles west to Houston, Texas. They spent five days in a Houston hotel until a local family provided them with shelter. Now Tenisha and her brother are getting used to a new school in Houston. ""I've started making new friends already,"" Tenisha told
Tenisha and Terren are not alone. An estimated 372,000 children from Louisiana and Mississippi have found themselves in new schools, since the hurricane caused damage and flooding in those states. Schools from Maine to California have embraced students like Tenisha and Terren with hugs, smiles, and welcome signs.
Schools in Texas expect to enroll as many as 60,000 new kids. Houston schools alone enrolled almost 2,000 students in the few days following the devastating hurricane.
Two schools in Houston that had closed last spring have reopened. The two schools are now devoted entirely to
children. An evacuee is a person forced to move from a place of danger. School principals are also hiring hundreds of new teachersmany are evacuees from Louisiana and Mississippi.
Being the new kid at school is never easy. Experts say that it's even harder for children
because of the hurricane. Displaced people have been forced to flee from their homes.
Students who have left their homes have to
or get used to, new schools, teachers, and friends, say officials. Schools also play an important role in helping kids from the stricken areas cope with the disaster of Katrina.
Tenisha and Terren are adjusting well to their new schoolMacGregor Music and Science Magnet School in Houston. So far, MacGregor has accepted more than 12 displaced students. ""We want each one of the new children to feel this is home for them,"" the school's principal, Patsy Brown, told
Students at MacGregor have welcomed the new faces. ""We want to make our new classmates feel good because we know they've gone through so much,"" fourth grader James McKethen told
James's sister, third grader Tiye McKethen, agrees. ""It's cool to have new friends. And they get to have fun in a new school and stay in a safe place.""
After just two days, Tenisha and Terren were settling in at MacGregor. ""Our new school is great!"" Tenisha told
But the siblings know that life has changed. Despite the warm welcome, Terren misses playing basketball with his friends in New Orleans. Tenisha, too, misses her old teachers. What's next for the family? They will likely settle down in Texas. Tenisha says, ""I want to stay in Houston.""
I live in Desoto, a town outside Dallas, Texas. My school district has taken in roughly 188 students from New Orleans. I must hand it to the kids; they are adapting pretty fast. It is cool because our school is doing everything to make the new students feel at home. We call it ""Southern hospitality.""
I have seen many acts of kindnesswhether it's letting a kid from New Orleans go to the front of the lunch line or giving a new student a personal tour of the school.
I wonder if I could be as strong if my city went through a disaster such as Katrina. What happens to New Orleans from here, we don't know. But what we do know is that we need to appreciate our family and friends. We need to be thankful for the things that we have because we do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Christopher Ray Clark is a sixth grader from the DallasFort Worth area. He and his family have been volunteering to help Katrina evacuees.

438,"A new sports car is making waves. With the touch of a button, this convertible turns into a boat. It recently went for a test-drive, jetting along the Thames River in London, the capital of England.
Named the Aquada, the car can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour on land and about 30 miles per hour on water. The wheels pull into the car as soon as it hits water.
To avoid leaks, the car has no doors. Like a boat, the car requires drivers and passengers to climb over the side to get into it.

426,"Scientists make a splash with the discovery of new marine species.
Scientists in Indonesia think they have found hidden treasure52 new types of marine animals! The researchers believe that the 24 types of fish, 20 types of corals, and 8 types of shrimp are new to science.
The researchers spotted the new species off the coast of Papua, a province on one of the more than 13,500 islands that make up Indonesia. The area, Birds Head Seascape, is one of the worlds most diverse marine regions.
""These Papuan reefs are literally species factories,"" says Mark Erdmann of Conservation International, who led the expedition. Many of the species are believed to be
to the area, meaning they are not found anywhere else.
Birds Head Seascape is part of Asias ""Coral Triangle."" The Triangle covers about 70,000 square miles in the Indian Ocean. It is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and almost 600 kinds of reef-building corals.
But the marine marvels off Papuas coast may be in danger. The Indonesian government is considering a plan to increase commercial fishing in the east, near Papua, because Indonesias western seas are overfished.
Wildlife groups are against the plan. They say it is
or absolutely necessary, to protect Birds Head Seascape. ""Its extremely important because this area is the center of coral reef
,"" Sherry Flumerfelt of the Coral Reef Alliance told
refers to the variety of species in a particular environment. We need to ""make sure these species are protected,"" says Flumerfelt.
Here are a few of the standout species that scientists recently spied in Indonesia.
A bottom-dwelling epaulette shark uses its fins to ""walk"" across the ocean floor in search of shrimp, crabs, snails, and small fish.
When its time to attract a mate, a male flasher wrasse ditches its drab brown hue for some brighter colors.
There are three times more fish in the Birds Head Seascape than in the Hawaiian Islands, including this newly discovered one.
Only a fraction of all marine species have been found. Why might it be difficult to find new ocean creatures?

681,"Iraq's new government prepares for the future.
Women line up to vote in the southern Iraqi city of Basra January 30, in the country's first freely contested elections since 1954.
The government in Iraq has started the process of choosing leaders and drafting a constitution, now that the election is over. On January 30, millions of Iraqis voted, braving violence and threats of attack in the country's first national election in 50 years.
On that historic day, voters elected 275 leaders to the National Assembly, Iraq's lawmaking body. The assembly recently chose a president and two vice presidents. At press time, those leaders were selecting a prime minister, the most powerful position in Iraq.
Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds.
The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groupsShiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to
Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents.
Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected.

628,"Drinks like soda have caffeine and lots of sugar.
Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word
in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them.
is a mineral found in milk and other dairy products that helps build strong teeth and bones.
Soft-drink giants aren't the only beverage companies trying to find their place in school districts. As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

98,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

674,"Fourth graders at C. A. Farley Elementary School are taking a stand! The students in Hudson, Massachusetts, act out plays to stop bullying.
These kids are acting out against bullies.
The students write skits. Then they perform the scenes for their classmates. One skit focuses on a group of kids that
a student because he wears glasses. To exclude is to leave out. Another is about a kid who stops a boy from sitting at a certain table in the cafeteria.
The kids act out two different endings for each skit. The first ending shows the bullying get worse. The other ending shows how to stop it.
It is a great program, school principal Sharon MacDonald told
It gives the students a way of  feeling like they are not alone.

359,"Look out, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys! Here comes the next hot musical act: the animals!
Scientists recently announced that the music made by several kinds of birds and humpback whales shares some of the notes, rhythms, and harmonies found in music created by people. Scientists say that these animals may also pass songs along to one another, which means animals may be able to learn music.
Roger Payne, one of the scientists studying animal music, says his study ""proves that musical sounds can be enjoyed by all living things.""
Because animals cannot sing in a human language, however, Britney Spears and other pop stars have nothing to worry about!

? A scavenger is an animal that feeds on dead animals.
For years, scientists have been debating that question. Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides.
""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit.

was not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food.
means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler.""
Other scientists don't agree with Horner. They argue that
wasn't fast, they say, it could have hunted slower dinosaurs. Scientists also say that
did not need its arms to hunt. Animals without arms, such as sharks and snakes, hunt prey.
have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?
Why is it important to study both sides of an argument?

625,"NASA shuttles have blasted spacecraft to far-off planets. They have even helped build a floating space lab. Now, the shuttles are ready for a new mission: their final countdown.
Officials at the U.S. space agency are ending the shuttle program this summer. The shuttle
will shoot for the stars one more time this month. Then
will make its last flight in June.
The program took off in 1981 when NASA sent
to space. NASA built five shuttles in all. The others were
. Each spacecraft could carry up to 10 astronauts. The shuttles could spend about two weeks in space at a time.
One of the shuttles most important jobs has been helping astronauts build the International Space Station. That is a lab that
Earth. To orbit is to circle. The shuttles
astronauts to the lab. To ferry is to carry. Scientists from many nations run tests at the lab.
The missions arent cheap, though. One trip to space costs about $450 million. To save money, the U.S. government will now send astronauts to the lab on shuttles owned by private companies.
The new plan will allow NASA to focus on a mission thats really out of this world. Space officials want to send astronauts to Mars. Scientists have used
, or robotic spacecraft, to explore the Red Planet, but humans have never set foot there.
Officials hope that changes soon. Were looking to send human missions to Mars, Allard Beutel told
He is a NASA spokesperson. These [changes] are the early steps ... to get us there.
These astronauts accomplishments launched them into history books.

Why might scientists want to study Mars?

Tornado in Union City, Oklahoma, May 24, 1973
season in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It travels quickly and can destroy everything in its path. Tornado season, which lasts for several months, is the time these twisters are most common.
The National Weather Service recently said it will change the tornado rating system next year. The strength of a tornado will continue to be rated on a scale from 0 (weakest) to 5 (most powerful). However, the new rating system will be more exact.
Under the old system, tornadoes with wind speed of about 300 miles per hour were given the rating 5. Studies have shown that slower winds can cause as much damage. The new system rates a tornado 5 if wind speed is at least 200 miles per hour.
Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell where, how, or when. Examples are

394,"Who will face Barack Obama in the race for U.S. president?
Being president of the United States isnt easy. Ask Barack Obama. Every day he faces huge problems, such as trying to create work for unemployed Americans.
Who would want such a hard job? Many people! There are 10 Republican
They want to run against Obama in the 2012 presidential election. A candidate is a person who runs for something. Obama is a Democrat.
Republicans and Democrats are the two main U.S.
Those are groups of people who share beliefs about how a nation should be run. Each party
The main Republican candidates are Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Gary Johnson, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Buddy Roemer, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum. When
went to press, Romney and Gingrich were leading in polls of Republican voters.

Romney was the governor of Massachusetts. If elected, he says, he will create jobs. About 9 percent of Americans are unemployed. My number-one job will be to see that America ... is number one in job creation, Romney says.
Gingrich was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978. Today he works as a political speaker. I believe we can return America to ... full employment, Gingrich says.
Election Day is almost a year away, but Republicans are hard at work. Beginning in 2012, they will hold special votes. They will narrow down their choices for a candidate.
Who will Obama face to be our next president? The voters will decide.
There are only three requirements to serve as the nations president, according to the U.S. Constitution.
How might Republicans decide which candidate to nominate?

464,"Scientists find great surprises in the Great Barrier Reef.
Brightly colored fish dart in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. That is a
a continent. A coral reef is a large underwater structure full of plants and animals. Coral is made of tiny sea animals called
. When polyps die, their hard shells become part of the reef.
Scientists recently explored the worlds largest coral reef. They also looked at another reef near Australia. Their search turned up hundreds of animal species. Some of the species may have never been seen before.
Scientists used netted bags to search the reef. They spied big-clawed shrimp and worms shaped like pine trees. They also found about 130 new types of soft coral.
The researchers left behind 36 plastic houses on the ocean floor. The scientists hope the creatures will move into the houses. That will make it easier to study them.
Learning about the creatures may help people protect them. One-third of the worlds coral reefs are threatened by pollution and fishing. Its important to find out whats in the Great Barrier Reef, says scientist Patricia Hendriks. She took part in the
, or trip with a specific goal. If we dont know what is present in the first place, how are we ever going to protect it properly?
What species did scientists spy in the Great Barrier Reef? Here are a few that made a splash.
This green-banded snapping shrimp has a large claw on one side. It looks like a tiny lobster.
This Christmas tree worm rests on a coral reef. It uses its branches to breathe and eat.
The cuttlefish is a boneless animal related to squid. It has eight arms that it uses to catch food.
This gorgonian fan won the hearts of researchers. The soft coral fan stretches more than 3 feet tall.

364,"Astronaut Mike Massimino is in a new movie, but hes not the star. The main character is the Hubble Space Telescope! That is a giant telescope that
or circles, Earth. Hubble takes pictures of space for scientists to study. The movie,
follows astronauts on a mission to repair Hubble.
student reporter Peter Brosnan interviewed Massimino about the mission.
How would you describe Hubble to kids?
Id say its as big as a school bus.
How did you feel saying good-bye to the Hubble Space Telescope?
We were happy that we didnt break it! ... We had done our job correctly, and it was on its way.
I think the best thing is the view of the Earth. ... Its as close as you can [get] to actually seeing it [from space]. Youll see how beautiful the Earth is.

343,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Does your backpack ever feel as if it's filled with bricks? If so, you are not alone. Many kids tend to overload their backpacks.
A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad
(POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk.
Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert.
What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!

107,"The worlds great apes are in danger. Many countries are working together to help them. Can these animals be saved in time?
Like all great apes, chimpanzees are in danger of losing their habitat.
Time is running out for the great apes. If no action is taken, they may soon be extinct, say experts. The great apes include gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia. The other great apes live in Africa.
More than 20 countries, mostly in Africa, recently signed a
to save the great apes. A pledge is a promise. At one time, millions of these animals lived in the wild. As few as 350,000 of them exist today.
Saving the great apes from dying out is no easy task. The animals face many threatsmost of them from humans. One of the biggest threats is the loss of habitat. Some people illegally cut down trees in the areas where great apes live.
Another threat to great apes is illegal hunting. People have eaten meat from wild animals for thousands of years.
""We have not treated [the great apes] with the respect they deserve,"" says Kofi Annan. He is the secretary-general of the United Nations. That is a group of countries that work together to solve world problems.
Although saving the great apes will not be easy, experts think the pledge is a step in the right direction. ""The great apes still have a chance,"" says Annan, ""but their fate lies entirely in our hands.""

69,"How does the government want to protect polar bears?
Polar bears are on thin ice. Their home in Alaska is in trouble. The animals could become
. That means to be at risk of dying out completely.
To help the big bears, some U.S. officials want to set aside more than 200,000 square miles in Alaska. The area would be a protected habitat. It would have special rules to help keep polar bears safe.
About 3,500 polar bears live in northern Alaska. That area is part of the Arctic. The Arctic is the northernmost place in the world. About 25,000 polar bears live there.
Some people are worried that the number could fall, though. Alaskas polar bears face dangers in their home. Some companies drill for oil off the states coast (right). People use oil to heat their homes. However, an oil spill could hurt the animals, some experts warn.
By creating a protected habitat for polar bears, the U.S. government could
drilling there. To limit is to control. Some Alaskans dont want the habitat, though. They say the bears dont need protection. Plus, drilling is important for the state, says Alaskas governor, Sean Parnell.
Melting sea ice is another problem for the polar bears. The animals stand on the ice while hunting for food. Some scientists say the ice is melting because of
. That is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Its important to protect polar bears habitat, wildlife expert Kassie Siegel told
656,424 square miles (Alaska is the largest state. It is more than twice the size of Texas.)
, or usual, January temperature is 11 degrees Fahrenheit. The average July temperature is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.

100,"Overfishing and melting ice spell trouble for penguins.
Life is good for penguins in Antarctica at the end of the movie
Real-life penguins, though, have little to celebrate.
Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming
or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.
""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told
Her wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins.
Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""We can and must reduce gas emissions to keep penguins safe in the future,"" says Siegel.

747,"The map shows where the body was found
About 5,300 years ago, a man walked along a mountain path. He stopped to rest and set down his copper ax. The man died there. In time, his body froze in the mountain's ice and snow. Now, scientists are trying to solve the mysteries this frozen man left behind.
In 1991, two climbers discovered a frozen body in the tztal (OETS-tahl) Mountains in Italy. Italy is a country in Europe. Scientists learned that the body was of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago. The ice had preserved his body, making it a
or warmed, the body so they could study the man's remains.
Scientists have nicknamed the mummy tzi, after the mountains where he was found. They have studied tzi's hair, teeth, skin, and clothes. So far, scientists have learned that tzi was probably a shepherd. He was wearing a grass cape, goatskin leggings, a bearskin cap, and fur-lined shoes. A
or guess, is that tzi was leading his herd of animals over the mountains when he died.
When he is not being studied, tzi is kept in a special freezer in a museum in Italy. His body is kept frozen so it does not
or rot. tzi's remains are helping scientists learn how much the world has changed in 5,300 years.

422,"On Veterans Day, November 11, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who served as soldiers for our country. Veterans Day celebrations include speeches, ceremonies, and parades.
This year is the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. The Korean War started when North Korea invaded South Korea. Both countries are in Asia. Many ceremonies will honor veterans of the Korean War. Those veterans helped South Korea fight the war between 1950 and 1953.

623,"Theres a bookworm in the White House. Its U.S. President Barack Obama. He wrote a new book for kids. The book is called
Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.
The picture book goes on sale November 16. It tells the stories of 13 important Americans, including baseball player Jackie Robinson. He was the first African American to play major-league baseball since the late 1800s.
Obama was excited to pen the book. Its a great
for me to speak to young people, he said in an interview on Sirius XM Radio. An opportunity is a chance.
The inspiring tales already have two young fansObamas daughters, Malia and Sasha. There is a drawing of them walking their dog on the cover. The girls were among the first people to review the book. I asked them to read it, [to] see what they thought, Obama says. They approved!

18,"People across America reach out to help victims of the hurricane.
Americans are working hard to get the Gulf Coast back on its feet. Cleanup after Hurricane Katrina is expected to take months. In some places, it may even take years. Roads, bridges, buildings, and houses need to be repaired.
Congress will spend billions of dollars to help rebuild. Other countries have donated millions.
Volunteers pass out bottles of water and food.
People across America are reaching out to Katrina's victims. Many people have donated money. Others have opened up their homes to families left homeless.
Government officials have also been working to help provide victims with houses, jobs, and education. Many kids are going to school in new communities.
""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston,Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to.""
Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29. Winds reached more than 145 miles an hour by the time it hit land. The fierce storm destroyed buildings, homes, and trees. Officials estimated that hundreds of people died.
After Katrina passed, most of New Orleans, Louisiana, was flooded. The reason is that the
which protect the city, collapsed. A levee is a raised area that prevents flooding.
Thousands of people fled the storm. Now many want to know when they can go homeand if they still have a home. Many lost everything.
""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time.""
is a strong, spinning storm that forms over oceans. Hurricane Katrina slammed into the coastlines of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

329,"Which famous African American do you most admire?
asked some third graders at Tamarac Elementary School in Holtsville, New York, that question. Here's what they said:
Jackie Robinson in a Kansas City Monarchs Uniform.
I admire Jackie Robinson. It must have been tough being the first African American to play major-league baseball. He wasn't treated equal. Instead of getting angry, Jackie Robinson showed how good he was. He made the Hall of Fame!
Rosa Parks was a very brave woman. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. She helped change the laws in our country by standing up for what she believed in.
Hockey player Anson Carter is whom I admire. He has proved to be a decent power forward for the New York Rangers. He always gives 100 percent. That will help the Rangers make their drive for the playoffs.

733,"recently zoomed very close to Earth. The space rock came within a million miles of our planet. That may sound like a great distance, but in outer space it is only a hop, skip, and a jump away.
. It is about 3 miles long and 1? miles wide. Scientists say the mountain-size asteroid has a very odd shape. Some scientists think it looks like an unshelled peanut; others say it looks like a potato or even a bowling pin.
Many smaller asteroids have been spotted much closer to Earth. However,
is the largest-known asteroid to come so close to our planet.

has been tumbling through space for billions of years. The asteroid will not come this close to Earth for more than 500 years.

513,"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is located in northern Alaska. The ANWR is home to polar bears, wolves, caribou, and other animals.
In 1960, the land was made a protected area for animals and plants. But now, President George W. Bush wants to allow companies to begin drilling for oil in the ANWR.
Supporters say that the oil drilling would provide jobs for Alaskans. They also argue that the oil in the ANWR will help lower oil and gasoline prices. They say that taking oil from U.S. land is cheaper than using foreign oil.
Today, most of the oil that is used in the United States is
Opponents say the drilling would pollute the area's land, air, and water. Pollution would harm the plants that the area's animals eat to survive.
Studies by the U.S. government show there may be only a six-month supply of oil in the ANWR. Opponents believe the risk of polluting the ANWR is not worth such a small supply of oil.

445,"Early in 2002, millions of monarch butterflies died from unusually rainy and cold weather in Mexico. Scientists are predicting fewer monarchs this winter than last. They are worried about the survival of these delicate creatures.
The monarchs' home in Mexico is slowly being destroyed. By law, trees cannot be cut down in certain areas of forest where the butterflies spend the winter. However, some people are cutting down the trees illegally.
The trees are very important to the survival of monarchs. ""The forest is like an umbrella,"" said butterfly expert Lincoln Brower. ""If you chop holes in the umbrella, you cause trouble. The butterflies get cold and wet and freeze to death.""
Mexican government officials are working with scientists to stop illegal logging. They are trying to
, or move from one area to another. Each fall, monarchs in North America head south for the winter. Most travel to the mountains of central Mexico. Some travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north.
Why might scientist want to protect monarch butterflies?
Some monarchs travel up to 3,000 miles each way! They are the only butterflies in the world that make such a long, round-trip migration. Scientists hope to protect the magnificent monarchs by saving the forest. ""If the forest continues to be cut down, the monarchs will have no place to go,"" said Brower.

101,"Hello! My name is Jasmine Padilla. I'm 8 years old and in the third grade. I live in a town called Tusayan. It is a town next to Grand Canyon National Park. My family has lived here a long time. I go to Grand Canyon School.
The Grand Canyon has very tall cliffs for walls, and it is so wide that the trees on the other side look like trees for ants! The rocks are shades of pink and brown.
My favorite time of year in the Grand Canyon is winter. I like the winter because we play in the snow and can make a snowman. I also like to play with my friends and hike. I have seen rabbits, deer, and elk. Sometimes I can hear coyotes howling.

635,"The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
One at a time, visitors take turns crawling into a wooden box at a new museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. The museum is the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. The box is like the one in which a slave hid in the 1840s so he could be shipped to freedom.
The museum teaches visitors about the Underground Railroad. It was not actually a real railroad. It was a secret system of routes used to help slaves in the South escape to freedom in the North.
Most runaway slaves traveled hundreds of miles. They hid during the day and fled at night. Along the way, they stopped at safe homes called
. People at the stations provided slaves with food, clothing, and a place to rest.
""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it weren't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" museum official Stephen DeVillez told

538,"Until a few months ago, Karli Mosher from Massachusetts had very long hair. It hung down past her waist. Not anymore! The 9-year-old recently chopped it off for a good cause.
Karli donated her hair to Locks of Love. That is a group that provides wigs to kids who have lost their hair because of certain medical conditions.
After watching a TV program about Locks of Love, Karli remembered a classmate who had lost her hair. ""I felt sad for her,"" Karli told
. It was then that Karli decided to donate her own hair.
Now she plans to grow her hair long again. ""In the future, when my hair gets really long, I'm going to do it again, and again!"" exclaimed Karli.

114,"Mars is about to become a busy place. Recently, the U.S. space agency, NASA, announced plans to send six spacecraft to Mars in the next ten years. Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when
landed on Mars. Millions of people on Earth watched as it's tiny rover, Sojourner, wandered over the planet's surface.
Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink.
A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust.
Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet.
Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base.
Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.
One day on Mars is 24 hours long; one year is 687 days long.
Temperatures on Mars range from -220 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to 68 degrees F.
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.
A person who weighs 50 pounds on Earth would weigh 19 pounds on Mars.

283,"Cave lions were the biggest lions that ever lived. Some were 11 feet long.
Mammoths had tusks that could grow up to 13 feet long.
Woolly rhinos weighed 2 to 3 tons. That's as heavy as a minivan!
Thousands of years ago, giant creatures roamed a frozen land. Scientists recently unearthed, or dug up, fossils of some of those creatures.
While working at a gravel pit in England, Ray Davies made an amazing discovery. He found the huge skull of a woolly rhino in the bucket of his digging machine. Woolly rhinos were large animals that became
After hearing about the discovery, scientists went to the gravel pit to get the skull. They looked in the pit for other
. Fossils are ancient remains of animals and plants. Scientists found many of the rhino's other bones. ""This is the best example of a woolly rhino I have ever seen,"" said scientist Andy Currant.
Scientists later found the bones of three other woolly rhinos. In addition, scientists found the bones of a woolly mammoth, bison, reindeer, wild horse, and wolf. Scientists also found the remains of insects and plants.
The fossils date back to a period of time called the Ice Age. That period started almost 2 million years ago. It ended around 10,000 years ago. During the Ice Age, snow and ice covered much of Earth.
At the end of the Ice Age, some animals survived. Other animals, like the woolly rhino, became extinct. The new fossils are clues to the past. They will help scientists learn more about the Ice Age.

365,"Taylor Momsen is the actress who plays
in the movie version of the Dr. Seuss story ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" Taylor wanted to adopt the dog that played Max in the movie. But Taylor's parents would not let her have a pet.
Instead, Taylor decided to help dogs in her hometown, St. Louis, Missouri. She learned that the Humane Society, a group that cares for homeless pets, needed towels to keep animals dry and warm. Taylor collected 100 towels, sheets, and blankets in her neighborhood to donate to the Humane Society.

Scientists use a robot to study lava near the volcano.
The spewer is called Axial Seamount. It rests at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The peak is about 250 miles from Oregon.
Scientists have been watching changes in the volcanos activity. Based on those changes, they decided that Axial Seamount would erupt. They said it would happen by 2014.
Researchers recently sent a robot down to the volcano to take pictures. They saw that the area was covered in lava. Scientists say the spewer erupted in April.
Experts hope the volcanos rumbles will help them learn more about underwater spewers, explains scientist Bill Chadwick.

26,"Two whale sharks named Ralph and Norton are quickly becoming friends. They live in a huge tank at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.

The whale sharks live in the largest tank at the aquarium. That is because whale sharks are the biggest fish in the world. They can grow up to 40 feet long! The aquarium also has hands-on exhibits.

Thousands of kids put their art skills to the test. They entered the Pier 1/UNICEF/ Weekly Reader greeting card contest. The winners were Adam Carr, 6, from Florida and Anna Hall, 12, from Colorado.
Adams and Annas drawings were made into greeting cards. Money earned from the sale of the cards will be used to help needy kids.

392,"Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

244,"Scientists are rushing to uncover and protect ruins of some very old cities. Those scientists have found lost cities in Asia and Africa that are more than 2,000 years old!
Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa.
About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics.
Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins.
Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero.
Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site.

414,"Are you ready for a vacation thats out of this world? Officials in Russia recently announced plans to build a hotel in space.
The four-room hotel will be designed to
or fit, up to seven guests at a time. Rooms will have large windows so people can look down at Earth. The hotel will most likely open for business by 2016, according to Alexander Derechin. He works for the company that will build the space hotel.
Several other businesses are also working to put more people in space. A British airline company is building a shuttle to take visitors into space. It expects the aircraft to be completed by 2012.
That and other shuttles will keep the space hotel busy, says Derechin. Spaceships [for the public] are being built around the world, he says. They will need to fly somewhere.

704,"that can climb hills? Just ask Colleen Whitman! The fifth grader and her classmates from Post Falls, Idaho, are creating a robot that can do exactly that. A robot is a machine that can do tasks without help from humans.
Colleen and her friends arent the only ones mastering machines. Hundreds of thousands of kids around the world are learning how to build robots. About 213,000 students are expected to enter the
robot competitions this year, according to experts. Thats about 20,000 more kids than the robot contests had last year.
At Colleens school, kids have a kit to build their machines. Then they use a computer to

684,"Scientists put on their detective hats in search of giant pandas.
Scientists were on the case! They collected clues. The scientists saw paw prints in the mud and fur on the bark of trees. What were they doing? Counting giant pandas!
After four years, the detective work is done. During that time, scientists figured out how many pandas live in China. All wild giant pandas live in that country.
""Pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
. ""They hide in the thick bamboo forests."" That is why scientists used clues to do the count.
The result of the panda count was a surprise to scientists. They learned that hundreds more pandas exist than experts once thought! ""We found pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" said Loucks.
Is it important to protect endangered animals? Why?
Although the news is good, pandas remain
. That means they are in danger of dying out.
A Panda spends 14 hours a day eating up to 83 pounds of bamboo.
A Newborn panda weighs 3 to 4 ounces. That is about the size a hamster.
A panda's front paws have a wrist bone. The bone works like a thumb. The panda uses it to grasp bamboo.
loss. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal lives. Panda habitat is lost when people cut down parts of the forest for wood and farming.
Currently, China has more than 40 giant panda nature centers. People are not allowed to cut down trees there. Scientists want to create more nature centers to give pandas a better chance for survival.

225,"Workers at a museum in Kansas recently found an old letter. It was dated January 27, 1793. The letter was written by Martha Washington. She was the wife of President George Washington. She sent the letter to her niece.
The letter was donated to the museum in 1959. Then it was misplaced. Workers soon forgot about the letter. Nobody here knew about it. It slipped out of its folder. It ended up on the bottom of a drawer, says Aline Luecke. She is a spokesperson for the museum. We were really excited to get it again, says Luecke.
Bettman/Corbis; letter: Cloud County Historical Society Museum

454,"The Arctic is feeling the heat. Its sea ice is melting. The ice has been shrinking for more than 30 years, says scientist Mark Serreze. Over the past five years, it has been melting faster and faster.
Serreze works at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which keeps track of how much snow and ice is on Earth. He predicts, We could be looking at an ice-free Arctic in 2030.
Why is the ice melting? Earth is getting warmer. Scientists say that is because of pollution in the air. As Earths temperature rises, sea ice at the Arctic melts. The animals there will have a hard time, says Serreze.

became the first submarine to sink an enemy ship. On its way back to shore, the sub disappeared.
In 1995, a team of divers found the
in the water off the coast of South Carolina. The sub was filled with 65,000 pounds of sand and water.
In August, divers put 32 thick straps around the sub. The straps were attached to a steel frame that surrounded the sub. A huge crane lifted the frame and the sub from the water in only three minutes.

260,"Cockroaches are not social insects, but they do live in groups. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cockroaches make group decisions. To do that, they created tiny robots that smelled like real roaches.
Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place.
Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too.
What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves.
The robotic cockroaches did not look like real insects. However, the real roaches did not notice. That is because scientists made sure that the robots smelled like roaches.

194,"It is important to brush your teeth every day. Brushing helps keep your teeth healthy. Keeping your teeth healthy is as easy as 1, 2, 3!
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Brush your teeth twice a day. Brush all parts of your mouth and even your tongue. Brush with short, back-and-forth motions. Don't forget to be gentle!
Floss your teeth once a day. Dental floss cleans between your teeth. Use it to remove food you missed with a toothbrush.
Visit the dentist twice a year. Your dentist will check and clean your teeth, take X-rays, and put
on your teeth. Fluoride helps keep your teeth strong.

210,"What is the difference between the two groups?
A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells.
Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards.
Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes.
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians.
Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land.
For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land.

546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.
That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.

578,"Gauri Nanda had trouble getting up in the morning. Her alarm clock would ring, and she would press the snooze button. Then she would not wake up on time.
One day, Nanda had an idea. She invented an alarm clock with wheels. She named it Clocky. Now people can use Clocky to help them wake up on time.
 A person hits the clocks snooze button, and the clock moves away.
 It can roll off a night table and move across the bedroom.
 As the clock moves, it beeps its alarm! That means that a person must get out of bed to find the clock.

367,"This year, Memorial Day will be celebrated on May 28. On this holiday, we honor the American men and women who have served in past wars. A special animal cemetery in New York honors dogs that helped soldiers in wars.
Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars.

340,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.

531,"More students are growing their own food.
Students at Madison Elementary gather around their garden.
Fruit and vegetable gardens are popping up at schools across the country. How did they get there? Students planted them.
Kids plant crops and later harvest them.
Kids at Madison Elementary School in Redondo Beach, California, plant gardens in the fall and the spring. In October, they planted lettuce, radishes, carrots, broccoli, peas, and cauliflower. They
the crops in January. To harvest is to gather a crop.
The vegetables were washed and served at a salad bar. Extra food was sold in the school cafeteria for lunch.
This month, students will plant tomatoes, corn, sunflowers, and strawberries.
Why are students learning how to grow gardens? Teachers want kids to learn healthy eating habits. Healthy foods give the body the energy it needs to grow and heal.
Many kids are now trying new foods and learning they like them. Lisa Samuelson is the parent volunteer in charge of the program. She says a lot of students have told her, I like salad. I didnt think I liked salad! Then those students have gone home and asked their parents to buy vegetables that they have tried at school.
Samuelsons daughter, Lucy, is one of those students. She is in second grade. I love the garden, she says. I didnt really like vegetables before we had the garden. Then we found out that gardening is cool. Now I like vegetables. My favorite is carrots.

486,"Kids can help keep track of monarchs. They can put tags on them. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found.
Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. We want to learn about monarchs so we can save them, says scientist Chip Taylor.
You can help put tags on monarchs. Find out more at

20,"Tornado season has started in the United States. A
is a powerful, spinning wind. It is also known as a twister.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path.
The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air.
Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July.
A tornado can destroy homes and trees.
Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large
, or ball-shaped pieces of ice, may also fall.
Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard.
Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form.
The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
As the tornado travels across the ground, it picks up anything in its way.

203,"The land on Devon Island is a lot like the land on Mars. Scientists wanted to find out what life on Mars might be like. Scientists lived on Devon Island to study it.
Scientists hope that someday people will be able to visit Mars. To find out what life on Mars might be like, scientists went to an island right here on Earth.
Devon Island is about 900 miles from the North Pole. Scientists say Mars might look a lot like Devon Island. Both Devon Island and Mars have rocky hills and valleys.
Devon Island is cold and so is Mars. Scientists used the cold weather on Devon Island to test a spacesuit they might wear on Mars.
How are Mars and Devon Island different?
From -20 degrees Fahrenheit to 55 degrees Fahrenheit
From -275 degrees Fahrenheit to 80 degrees Fahrenheit
Six different scientists visit every two weeks
About $4 million for a two-week trip
A visit to Mars might not happen for many years. But by studying Devon Island, scientists will be ready for the trip.
A day on Mars lasts 24 hours, 37 minutes.
A year on Mars is 687 Earth days long.
Mars is 49 million miles away from Earth.
Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system.

Both the United States and Russia are worried about polar bears. Russia is a large country in Europe and Asia. Many polar bears are hunted each year. Some people eat polar bear meat.

248,"Some students in Nebraska think of veterans as lifesavers. The kids attend Dakota City Elementary School. They decided to have a candy sale. What did they sell? Life Savers!
The students made more than a thousand dollars. They donated the money to help build a park. The park will honor veterans. It will be called Siouxland Freedom Park.
It will be a living memorial that will honor veteranspast, present, and future. We look forward to groups of students coming to visit, says Mike Newhouse. He is the president of the Siouxland Freedom Park project. He is also a veteran.

63,"Mount Rushmore is a mountain in South Dakota. The faces of four U.S. presidents are carved on it. Now a special model is being made of Mount Rushmore.
What will make the model so special? It will be shown on a computer in 3-D! That makes pictures look more like the real object, instead of looking flat.
People are making the 3-D model for an important reason. If Mount Rushmore is ever damaged, it will need to be fixed. The 3-D model will show people what the carving looked like.
Mount Rushmore shows the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each face is as tall as a six-story building!
A landmark is a building or place that is special to an area. Americans want to make sure that Mount Rushmore will be here for a long time.

190,"Many African penguins live on Robben Island. A ship carrying oil sank near the island. The oil spilled into the water and covered thousands of penguins. Oil can make penguins sick, so wildlife workers tried to help them.
In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds!
Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil.
Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home.
Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:
The emperor penguin is the largest of all penguins. It stands about 4 feet tall and can weigh up to 100 pounds.
The little blue penguin is the smallest penguin. It is only a foot high and weighs less than 2 pounds.

479,"Tornado season has hit the United States. Tornadoes are also known as twisters. They can happen at any time of year. However, they are most common from March to July.
Most tornadoes begin as thunderstorms. Air rises from the ground to the storm clouds. Sometimes that rising air starts to spin. A funnel-shaped cloud can form. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, they can travel across large areas of land. Winds can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour. The storms can destroy everything in their paths.

7,"The MacPherson family left their home in Washington, D.C., last July. They will travel around the world for one year. The MacPhersons will visit South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

Did you know that Popsicles were once called Epsicles? They were named after Frank Epperson. He invented them by accident in 1905 at the age of 11. One night, he left a drink outside in the cold. The drink had a stirring stick in it. The next day, he saw that the drink had frozen around the stick. Epperson began selling his Epsicles in 1923. At that time, they came in seven flavors.
 What name did Frank Epperson give his invention?
 What happened when he left his drink outside?
 When did he start selling his frozen treats?

400,"Many kids love listening to music on their MP3 players. However, portable music players may not be good for the ears. Health experts say the music players may lead to hearing loss. Why? They send loud sounds straight into the ears. Hearing loss is also more likely if you listen to loud music for hours at a time.
Experts say kids need to give their ears a rest. They warn that at least 12 out of 100 children are at risk of losing some of their hearing.
How do you know if your music is too loud? If you are wearing your earphones, you should be able to hear someone talking to you from a few feet away.
You can also ask friends if they can hear the music from your earphones. If they say yes, turn it down!

197,"Some people fly airplanes into hurricanes! That is what Chad Gibson does. He is a member of a group called Hurricane Hunters.
Hurricane Hunters measure the storms wind speed and strength. Scientists use that information to predict when and where a hurricane is going to hit land.
What is it like to fly into a hurricane? There are times when you just see the clouds, says Gibson. You really cant see anything else.

354,"The United States is having money trouble. It now costs more than a penny to make a penny. A nickel costs nearly 8 cents to make.
Why are those coins so costly? Copper, nickel, and zinc are metals that are going up in price. Copper and zinc are used to make pennies. Nickel and copper are used in nickels.
Some lawmakers want the U.S Mint to use a cheaper metal: steel. It was used in pennies made in 1943, when there wasnt enough copper. You wont see new steel coins just yet. Other lawmakers first have to agree to the plan.
Some lawmakers want to bring back the steel penny.
