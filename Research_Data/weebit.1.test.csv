6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

The structures of control in the Nazi state
Measures were imposed to make sure that schools and youth associations became Nazified:
Non-Nazi teachers and university professors were sacked; teachers had to join the National Socialist Teachers' League.
Textbooks were re-written to include Nazi political and racial ideas.
There was a concentration on physical fitness.
Girls were taught cookery; boys were taught science and maths.
The Hitler Youth was compulsory; it indoctrinated boys and prepared them for war.
The Nazi Girls' youth organisation - the BDM - was compulsory; it indoctrinated girls and prepared them for church, children and cooking.
The following points are examples of how the Nazis took control of workers lives:
The RAD (National Labour Service) sent young men on public works.
Hitler introduced conscription in 1936; most men went into the army after the RAD.
The DAF (German Labour Front) controlled workers' conditions at work.
The KdF (Strength through Joy) movement regulated their leisure time.

1822,"You should know some of the factors affecting the stopping distance of a car.
It takes a certain amount of time for a driver to react to a hazard and start applying the brakes. During this time, the car is still moving. The faster the car is travelling, the greater this thinking distance will be.
The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.
The braking distance will also increase if:
The weather conditions are poor, such as an icy or wet road.
The car is more heavily laden, for example, with passengers and luggage.
The stopping distance is the thinking distance added to the braking distance. The graph shows some typical stopping distances.

3123,"Decay is an essential life process, which helps to digest food and recycle materials. Bacteria and fungi are the main groups of decomposer. They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

1862,"A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
for trust in real life situations. In the exercise, the person falling trusts that they will be caught by those behind them. In the minefield of personal relationships, you rely upon family and friends to 'catch' you.
The second stanza is full of colour. The jacket is canary-yellow (line 5) and becomes blackened (line 7). The child see[s] red - Armitage chose a phrase that uses colour to depict anger - and Blue murder is threatened. Yellow, red and blue are the primary colours: perhaps Armitage used these to show how vivid and 'colourful' the child's memories of the row are - it is obviously still important to him many years later.
The mother is described as the very model of a model of a mother (line 8). Does this suggest that she is a typical mother figure (as if like a child's model toy, reproduced in a factory) or a more-than-perfect mother (model as an adjective can mean 'ideally perfect')? Either way, she makes the wrong assumption about how the jacket got dirty - in the child's eyes, as least.
It is midnight when the child escapes to the phone box - always a time when special things may happen! This call seems to have been a symbolic attempt to get in touch with his future adult self.
The father figure (line 17) is in silhouette: the child can see his shape, but not his whole body. Does this suggest that their relationship with him is not now as 'rounded' as a result of the row? It is not definite that he is the child's actual father - only a father figure. The fact that he is waiting outside shows that he is concerned for the welfare of the child, but also that he wants to set things straight (line 17) - perhaps implying that the argument is not over yet!
The final stanza is an extended metaphor. The embrace between the child and the family is likened to putting on the yellow jacket that caused the row in the first place. Parts of the body become parts of the jacket, to show us how warm and loving the hug is. The poet does not know exactly what the jacket looks like -
""these fingers make a zip / or buckle, you say which""
(line 20), but it does not matter as
(line 23). In other words, continuity is restored, the family is whole again.
We can 'hear' some of the family row. Stanza two has many short phrases, showing tension rising in the household. Armitage uses
that the child and the mother may actually have spoken.
(line 11) could be the order of a furious parent: we can imagine their finger pointing towards the door!

2914,"Metals are extracted from ores. An ore is a rock that contains enough of a mineral (metal compound) for the metal to be extracted from it. Most metals are extracted from an ore by reduction with carbon or by electrolysis.
Metals such as zinc, iron and copper are present in ores as their
. Each of these oxides is heated with carbon to obtain the metal.
iron oxide + carbon  iron + carbon dioxide
(s) + 3C(s)  4Fe(l) + 3CO
The source of carbon for this reduction is
, obtained by heating coal in the absence of oxygen. Note that the iron is
when it is formed, due to the very high temperature at which the reaction takes place.
Some metals, such as aluminium, are so
that their oxides cannot be reduced by carbon.
. For example, copper(II) chloride contains positively charged copper ions and negatively charged chloride ions. Ionic substances can be
into the elements they are made from by electricity, in a process called
For electrolysis to work, the ions must be
, the ions break free from the ionic lattice. These ions are then free to move.
For example, if electricity is passed through copper(II) chloride solution, the copper(II) chloride is broken down to form copper metal and chlorine gas.
There is a similar result if electricity is passed through molten copper(II) chloride.
The solution or molten ionic compound is called an

, while the positive electrode is called the
Positively charged ions move to the negative electrode. Metal ions are positively charged, so metals are produced at the negative electrode (cathode).
Negatively charged ions move to the positive electrode. Non-metal ions, such as oxide ions and chloride ions, are negatively charged, so gases such as oxygen or chlorine are produced at the positive electrode (anode).

. The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder, aluminium oxide, from which aluminium can be extracted.
. But first the aluminium oxide must be made
so that electricity can pass through it. Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2,000C), so it would be expensive to melt it. Instead, it is
, an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide. The use of cryolite reduces some of the energy costs involved in extracting aluminium.
The diagram shows an aluminium oxide electrolysis tank. Both the negative electrode (cathode) and positive electrode (anode) are made of
forms at the negative electrode and sinks to the bottom of the tank, where it is tapped off.
forms at the positive electrodes. This oxygen reacts with the carbon of the positive electrodes, forming carbon dioxide, and they gradually burn away. Consequently, the positive electrodes have to be replaced frequently, which adds to the cost of the process.

Given the equation for the extraction of a metal, it is possible to calculate the mass of
What mass of iron metal can be made from 5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide?
(s) + 3C(s) = 4Fe(l) + 3CO
C = 12, Fe = 56, O = 16
These relative atomic masses can be used to find the
has the formula mass = (2 x 56) + (3 x 16) = 160
produces 4Fe. Working this out in tonnes gives:
= (2 x 160) = 320 tonnes produces 4Fe = (4 x 56) = 224 tonnes of iron metal.
5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide produces 5 x 224/320 = 3.5 tonnes of iron.
It is also possible to calculate the maximum mass of a metal that can be obtained from a specific mass of ore by comparing their formulae.
contains 2 x 56 = 112 tonnes of Fe
5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide produces 5 x 112/160 = 3.5 tonnes of iron.
During electrolysis, metal ions, which are positive, gain electrons from the negative electrode (cathode) to form
In the extraction of aluminium, this is the equation for the reaction at the
At the positive electrode (anode), non-metal ions, which are negative, lose electrons to form neutral atoms. These atoms join to make molecules of the non-metal element, such as a molecules of oxygen gas.

2234,"All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole. Note that cells may be specialised to carry out a particular function.
Dissolved substances pass into and out of cells by diffusion. Water passes into and out of cells by osmosis.
Function of cells which animal and plant cells have in common
contains genetic material, which controls the activities of the cell
most chemical processes take place here, controlled by enzymes
controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell
most energy is released by respiration here
contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis
filled with cell sap to help keep the cell
having turgor; enlarged and swollen with water

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

the pole between the handle and the blade

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -
Where a phrase or word is repeated several times to emphasise or make a particular point.
(line 16) suggests not only Heaney's affection for his grandfather, but his father's affection for him too: the love between them bonds the three generations.
Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?
An explicit comparison of one thing to another, using the words 'like' or 'as'. 'Sleeping like a log' and 'bright as a button' are similes.

To do with a drama or play. A description or portrayal that is vivid and immediate - as if it is being acted out in front of you. Something that is tense or exciting.
. Heaney looks down from his window to see his father digging - and then we find he is looking back twenty years. The pause between the stanzas indicates the gap in time.
The penultimate stanza appeals to our senses. Heaney gives us the cold smell of
""squelch and slap / Of soggy peat""
(line 26). This helps to make what he describes more vivid. How does
Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.
The final stanza almost brings the poem round full circle. It repeats the opening lines:
""Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests.""
Yet the gun image is replaced by
His pen becomes a metaphorical spade. This suggests that his pen is his tool, just as the spades were tools for his father and grandfather. It also suggests that Heaney wants to 'go back to his roots' - to dig into his past through his writing.

Alliteration is used a lot to recreate the feel and sensation of digging: for example,

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a
An image or thing (usually something physical, like a flag) that stands for or represents something else - usually something abstract, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
for productive, creative work in general - and for writing in particular.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
of digging, Heaney also suggests that he himself needs to dig into the past, and dig into the English language to say what he wants to say.
Have a look at these , and our suggestions about how they fit into these
Central, unifying ideas that run through a text or performance.
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.
.. living roots awaken in my head.
These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

It may help you to visualise photos in an album, set out regularly over a page.
It may help you to realise the regularity of time passing. (The poem keeps reminding us that ten years after the photo was taken, the happy, bold teenager had become a mother.)
Think about how the language contributes to the mood of the poem. Here are some points to consider:
There are many references to her mother as

Life back then is seen as very

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.
of the part of atmosphere (air) closest to the surface of the earth.
The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called
The science of monitoring and studying the atmosphere and predicting its weather and climate is called
. People who study the weather and climate are known as meteorologists.

for resources. Before the beginning of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, small groups of humans wandered across large areas, hunting and gathering just enough food to stay alive. Population numbers were kept low because of the difficulty of finding food.
The development of agriculture led to a population explosion that has accelerated enormously during the past 500 years. Unlike other species, humans can
Human population growth over the past 10,000 years
People in the developed world enjoy a high standard of living, with abundant food, cars and comfortable housing. People in the developing world have a lower standard of living, but many countries are catching up quickly.
The worlds human population has passed 6 billion and continues to increase. The growth in the human population and the increase in the standard of living are putting strains on the global environment. Here are some of the ways in which this is happening:
non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are being used up rapidly
raw materials are being used up rapidly
A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even common household items can contain
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
is also discharged onto the land. Many farmers apply
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.

animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.
The most common source of air pollution is the combustion of
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
. This usually happens in vehicle engines and power stations.
Deposits soot on buildings and trees, causing them damage. Permeates the air, making it difficult for living creatures to breathe.
greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming
depletes ozone in the upper atmosphere, so damages the ozone layer
Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air
In places where no lichens are growing, it's often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.
Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.
Here are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:
changes to the environment, such as a change in climate
since life on Earth began. Extinction is still happening and a lot of it occurs because of human activities. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and we are very successful predators.
The dodo was a large flightless bird that lived on Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The island was uninhabited and the dodo had no natural predators. Then Mauritius was colonised by the Dutch in 1638. Dodos were
and easy to catch because they were not afraid of people. New competitors were brought onto the island, including pigs, cats and rats, which ate the dodos' eggs and their young. Within 80 years, the dodo was
The panda and gorilla are endangered, and may become extinct. Some species in Britain are endangered, too, including the red kite, red squirrel and osprey. They could be helped by measures such as:
legal protection and protection of their habitats
making artificial ecosystems for them to live in
These measures are difficult to implement when dealing with certain organisms, such as whales. These animals live in international waters, so international laws and agreements are needed to protect them.
Fish are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a worldwide average 15% of humans' protein intake. Most of these fish are caught wild, and if fish are caught at a faster rate than the remaining fish can reproduce, the stock of fish will obviously decline. Trying to harvest more fish than the sea can produce is an example of
an activity which uses up resources or damages the environment so that it cannot be continued in the future
Since the 1960s North Sea cod have been overfished, as more and more - and bigger - fishing boats caught more and more cod. At first, catches continued to increase each year. But then - surprise, surprise! - they started to decline, as there were not enough breeding fish left to maintain the cod population. Today, North Sea cod are in danger of extinction.
Humans have now been cutting down trees for around 10,000 years - for wood to burn or build with, or to clear land for farming.
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after harvesting - but often this is not done. The result is that the area of forest is steadily shrinking - a process called
Deforestation is the destroying of forests by cutting down trees (for timber) or by burning. Often the purpose is to make way for agricultural land.

The maps give an idea of how much of the Earth's forest has been lost in the last 10,000 years.
Particularly worrying is the rapid destruction of
. This type of forest is often referred to as 'the Earth's lungs' because it produces around 40% of the world's atmospheric oxygen. It is also home to an estimated 50% of all species on Earth - once lost, the original habitats can never be replaced. Tropical rainforest is being cut down at the rate of 17 - 20 million hectares a year.
Humans reduce the amount of land and resources available for plants and animals. This happens because of farming, quarrying, dumping waste and building.
Urbanisation means the growth of cities. About
half the worlds population live in cities
, and most of the population growth in the future is expected to take place in cities. It is predicted that by 2015,
the worlds six largest cities will each have more than 20 million inhabitants
. These are some of the effects of urbanisation:
land no longer used for food production
decline of rural towns and villages as people leave them to live in cities
means improving our quality of life without damaging the quality of life of future generations. It is important to all of us, not just the other inhabitants of the planet, that sustainable development is achieved. This involves each of us as individuals, and careful planning at local, regional and global levels.

1135,"These are the steps in selective breeding:
from parents to breed the next generation
wheat by crossbreeding wheat plants with disease resistance and wheat plants with a high yield.
by selecting bulls from high yield herds and breeding them with cows that have the best milk production.
Selective breeding can also be used to modify other characteristics of cattle.
Aberdeen Angus bull - bred for beef
Problems with selective breeding - higher tier
Future generations of selectively bred organisms will all share very
more dangerous as all the organisms would be affected. Also there's increased risk of genetic disease caused by

Vielen Dank fr Deine schne Postkarte aus Cornwall. Mutti, Paul und ich fahren zu unserer Oma in Schwerin. Wir fahren morgen mit der Bahn dahin. Unser Kaninchen fhrt aber nicht mit und Papa bleibt zu Hause, denn er muss arbeiten. Paul nimmt seine Gitarre mit, die er zu Ostern gekauft hat, aber er kann noch nicht gut spielen! In Schwerin fahren wir gerne Rad. Am Wochenende fahren wir nach Warnemnde. Das liegt an der Kste nicht weit von Rostock. Das macht immer Spa.
They are going to travel by train.
The rabbit was staying behind with Hannah's father.
Warnemnde is on the coast near Rostock.

joints in which the components meet at right-angles and fit tightly with each other
, brazed or welded joints, or with fastening components such as nails, screws, bolts, and
metal or plastic fasteners. The rivet is inserted into holes in the materials to be joined and then end deformed to hold it in place.
Joints in wood can be with screws, nails, glues and

Joints in metal can be made with

There are many types of adhesives to suit different materials. When you are choosing the right one for your product you will have to take into consideration the type of material, the strength of the bond required and the environment the product will work in - for example if you are gluing timber for outdoor use, you would not use polyvinyl acetate (PVA), because it is water soluble.
will join almost anything to anything. It is widely used in industry, for example, many parts of aircraft are held together with double-sided tape!
Joining wood 1: screws, nails, glues and knock-downs
There are many different ways of making joints in wood. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength required and the quality of the product. Temporary fixings will often be done using fastening components such screws or bolts. More permanent joints can be achieved with glue, or with nails - though these may lack strength and be rough-and-ready in appearance.
All screwing needs two sizes of hole. The

smooth, narrow part between the head and core of a screw
of the screw, so that the shank can move freely in the clearance hole. The
must be smaller - slightly smaller than the

of the screw - so that the core fits tightly into it.
Screws come with different types of head. They can be flat or round-headed, and be fitted with a slot (for traditional screwdrivers), crosses (for Phillips or Posidrive screwdrivers) or square holes (for square drivers). If the screw head is to lie flush with the surface of the wood, the hole must be enlarged or
are made from very hard steel. They have a thread which goes all the way up to the head, and cut an internal thread as they are screwed in. They can be used in metal and plastic as well as wood. Machine screws are used for joining metal and plastic components.
Nails come in different shapes and sizes. Nails are much cheaper than screws and quick to put in. You do not need to drill holes in the wood first, except sometimes when using hard wood or to prevent the wood splitting.
When using wood glue, make sure you:
Get the surfaces to be glued to fit well - no gaps!
Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.
Get everything ready before you start - glue, brush, damp cloth, clamps and blocks to protect your work.
Don't start to glue up unless you are sure you have enough time - you can't stop half way through!
. This makes it easy to transport and store. The customer then has to assemble it at home. Usually
(KD) fittings are used. Most KD fittings consist of
fittings. Usually these are made from a plastic such as nylon.
Strong, permanent and neat-looking joints in timber are achieved using one of the many types of

When pieces of wood are joined along their edges, the joint may need to be supported in some way to reinforce or make it look neater. Sometimes a strip of wood is glued or pinned over the joint, called

As with wood, there are many ways of joining metal permanently. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength needed and the quality of the product.
Brazing is a way of bonding materials (usually metals) by melting a filler metal or alloy between the components you want to join. The filler metals used in brazing usually have melting points between 450C and 1000C, but must have a lower melting point than the material being joined. Brazing forms very strong, permanent joints.

is used to make permanent joints between copper, brass, tinplate or light steelwork, and is the normal way of joining electronic circuit components. Soft solder melts at about 200C. The solder flows into the heated metal along the joint, distributes itself by capillary action, and grips the two pieces together when it all cools.
melts at 625C, and is used for stronger joints.
Welding is different from soldering in that the two pieces of metal are themselves melted along the joints, fusing together as they cool. In

2073,"Obviously designers have to think about what people want from a product. But consumer demand is a complex matter. Consumers are influenced by fashion, by public perceptions, by moral attitudes, and by changing lifestyles.
Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards.
Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by
. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures.
Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users.
At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell.
Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products.
Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes.
Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers.
The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.
formal rules adopted by Parliament and enforced by government
guidelines or specifications which are widely agreed and commonly accepted, but do not necessarily have the force of law
exist to protect the consumer from faulty or sub-standard goods and services. There are a wide range of laws which can be enforced by
who work for local councils. These laws allow consumers to get their money back if goods are found to be faulty or if products do not perform in the way claimed by the manufacturer.
You need to know about the following three pieces of legislation:
This replaced the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Its most important provisions are:
control of monopolies (where a single business has a 25% share of the market or more, and is damaging competition)
control of mergers (where two or more companies join together, which might have adverse effects on competition and the public interest)
control of 'rogue traders' - giving the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) power to take action against businesses that persistently breach civil or criminal law when dealing with consumers
prohibiting the manufacture and supply of unsafe goods
making the person who manufactures or sells a defective product responsible for damage it causes
allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe goods
prohibiting misleading price indications - eg, giving misleading information about discounts or sale prices
Makes it an offence for a trader to make false or misleading statements about goods or services. The Act carries criminal penalties and is enforced by local authorities' Trading Standards Officers. This Act makes it an offence for a trader to
apply a false trade description to any goods
supply or offer to supply any goods to which a false trade description has been applied
make certain kinds of false statement about the provision of any services, facilities or accommodation
UK products should be made to safety standards set by both the
. The BSI Kite Mark shows that a product has been made to British standards, while the CE mark shows that a product has been made to EC standards.
When designing your own product, you also need to ensure it will meet safety standards.
Product designers should also take into account
whenever they design or make a product. 'Moral issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on other people. 'Environmental issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on the environment. In practice, since people must live in the environment, it's difficult to separate these things out from each other.
The list below outlines some of the key moral and environmental questions a designer should ask themselves about their product.
Is the cost of the product justifiable?
Does the product make efficient use of natural resources?
Are there any waste products which could pollute the environment?
Can the product be recycled after use?
Having considered the potential moral and environmental impact of a product, a designer may decide to use alternative processes, materials or chemicals. The use of alternatives may mean that some parts of the product need to be re-designed, or an alternative manufacturing process needs to be used.

4189,"Chemistry usually works with materials on a large scale. Even just a gram of a chemical consists of millions of millions of millions of molecules and chemical reactions affect all the particles in the sample.
. The individual fullerene molecules or nanotubes have different properties from the bulk material.
The nanotubes structure allows it to be used as a vessel for transporting a drug into the body. A molecule of the drug can be placed inside the nanotube cage which keeps the drug wrapped up until it reaches the site where it's required. In this way, a dose that might be prohibitively damaging to other parts of the body can be delivered safely to, say, a cancerous tumour.
The structure of nanotubes involves a massive surface area. Spreading a catalyst, atom by atom, on the surface of a nanotube provides a huge surface area where reactants can come into contact with the catalyst.
The examples above might be described as molecular manufacturing or nanotechnology. Building a product molecule by molecule, positioning molecules one at a time or producing nanoscale features by removing matter from a bigger structure may enable us to do things which only a short time ago were undreamed of.

5421,"There are two types of timber: softwood and hardwood.
usually come from coniferous trees - that is, evergreen, needle-leaved, cone-bearing trees such as fir and pine. They do not have the hard cell structure that gives hardwood trees their name.
come from broad-leaved, deciduous trees, and are more important in Design and Technology than softwood timbers. The main hardwood timbers are ash, beech, birch, cherry, elm, iroko, mahogany, meranti, oak, obeche, sapele and teak.
The table lists the properties and uses of these hardwood timbers.
Light, creamy brown. Europe & North America
a wood with visible large pores - eg oak
able to withstand blows or sudden shocks without breaking.
capable of being bent or flexed many times without breaking
a wood with no visible large pores - eg beech
able to resist wear, scratching and indentation.
able to withstand a force without breaking or bending.
bends or twists out of shape, this is common with wood
Some furniture, especially chairs; toys; wooden parts of tools
Fairly soft and easy to work. Open grain
the grains have a weave like structure, the wood is often suitable for bending
able to withstand wear, especially as a result of weathering.

2625,"This Revision Bite is about what makes or
a person to want to do a good job in the workplace.
Why are businesses interested in staff motivation?
Employees are encouraged to work hard by financial or other rewards.
is good for business. Here are some examples why:
Motivated workers are more productive and higher
the amount of output achieved for every unit of input used. A productive manufacturing system will produce consistently high quality products with the minimum of wasted time, money or effort
In a service industry, workers who are well motivated will provide a better level of customer service, keeping the customers happy.
Staff who are well motivated are more likely to stay with the company. They grow in experience and become even more valuable to their employer.
If a business successfully keeps the staff it has, the cost of recruiting and training new staff is reduced.
Most people work to satisfy needs of one kind or another.
Things that are offered to employees to motivate them that are not money like training, a gym, holidays etc.
are things other than money that motivate people to work.
based on research about what motivates people to work. He suggested that there were 5 levels of need that influence a person's behaviour.
The need to satisfy the basics to keep us alive ie food, drink and shelter.
The need to satisfy out requirement to feel safe ie protection against danger, threat, deprivation.
The need to be social ie by belonging, by acceptance or friendship.
Things like your reputation or your status.
The need for realising one's own potential for continual self-development eg through training.
In a hierarchy the things at the top are more important than those at the bottom. Maslow said the lower levels (basic needs) have to be satisfied first. Only when these needs have been satisfied will the individual strive to satisfy the higher needs (safety, social, self-esteem and self actualisation). For example, hungry, cold people will seek food and shelter first. Once they are well fed and comfortable, they will turn their attention to higher needs, for example the pleasure of being with colleagues.
How can a business provide for these needs?
A fair wage, a meal and rest facilities.
Job security, safe working conditions, pension schemes.
Met by introducing team work and perhaps providing social facilities like a club or sports pitch.
This is about how others see us at work and can be provided for by rewarding staff with status symbols like cars, offices and new job titles. Allowing staff to gain qualifications at work can boost self-esteem too.
Achieving your full potential. A business must ensure that promotion is possible and that there are opportunities to use initiative.
Money, and the way it is paid, can affect motivation to work. In your exam, you may be asked to calculate wages and bonuses or to compare one type of payment scheme to another. These are some of the most usual payment systems:
Paying by the number of hours worked
Paying by the number of items (pieces) produced.
Extra pay for work done over and above normal working hours. It is usually paid at a higher hourly rate, eg
Usually paid for working unsocial hours such as night work.
A special single payment for achieving a target.
A percentage of the company's profit is shared amongst the workers.
Paying extra money for jobs with difficult hours will usually encourage people to apply for the work.
can be used to persuade workers to stay with their employer for a long period of time. Employees may not want to work longer than their contracted hours but they can often be persuaded to do so by receiving a higher rate of pay.
is a payment in kind. Instead of giving money the employer might provide:
It is often cheaper for the employer to provide goods rather than the money to buy them with. A good perk will make an employee reluctant to leave the business.
Most examinations in this subject are based on a
, which provides a setting for business theory. Look carefully at your case study to see if there is any information about working conditions. Think about the kind of financial and non financial motivators which might apply to your given case study.
In your exam you might get a question that requires you to refer to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Look at this example of a typical exam question.
The person who is responsible for making sure employees are managed effectively in a business.
of a large company. Feedback suggests many of the workers are unhappy and are looking for new jobs. Recent figures show productivity has fallen. You know that the Managing Director has said there will be no wage increases this year. What improvements could you suggest at the next management meeting which would improve motivation and productivity?
A good answer will suggest introducing some of the following things:
Providing a pleasant room for staff to use during breaks.
Providing subsidised meals or improving the existing canteen.
Introducing teamworking and giving teams more say in how things are done.
Introducing a newsletter or regular briefing for all staff.
Rewarding staff with perks like company cars, insurance schemes or discounted goods.
In your answer you will need to show you know about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Apply it to this case study, giving examples of how the company could meet workers' needs at all levels.
Writing about pay and perks in your exam
In your exam, you may be asked to calculate wages and bonuses or to compare one type of payment scheme to another.

2202,"In a bid to improve roads, the first Turnpike Trusts were set up in 1663. These organisations introduced tolls on roads and aimed to use the money raised to maintain the roads. However, the Turnpike Trust scheme still had its problems.
The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.
who were sometimes more interested in making a profit than maintaining the good condition of roads for their customers. The businessmen had to get an Act of Parliament passed to build their turnpike and had to employ professional road surveyors, treasurers and reputable road engineers.
A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and
(such as Thomas Telford) to build straighter and better roads. However, people who had always used local roads did not like suddenly having to now pay for the same route. For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.

2154,"Species gradually evolve by a process of natural selection. The individuals in any population with the inherited features best suited to the environment in which they live are most likely to survive and reproduce. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these features to their offspring.
Over time, a species can change its appearance and may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
Selective breeding, also called artificial selection, involves people taking charge of selection to produce new 'varieties' of various species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties (or breeds) - they may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs.
From left to right - Beagle, Wheaten Terrier, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Red Siberian Husky, Irish Setter, Golden Retriever, Boxer, Sheltie
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes

In plain-weave the warp and weft are aligned so that they form a simple criss-cross pattern. It is strong and hardwearing. It is used for fashion and furnishing fabrics.
In twill-weave the crossings of weft and warp are offset to give a diagonal pattern on the fabric surface. Twill weave is strong and

well. It is used for jeans, jackets and curtains.
Weft-knitted fabrics are made by hand or machine. Weft knits are used for socks, T-shirts and jumpers.
Weft-knitted fabric is made by looping together long lengths of yarn. This makes the fabric stretchy and comfortable.
The yarn runs in rows across the fabric. If a stitch is dropped it will ladder down the length of the fabric.
Weft knits, made by hand or machine, are used for socks, T-shirts and jumpers.
Warp-knitted fabric is made by machine and is used for swimwear.
The loops interlock vertically along the length of the fabric. Warp knits are slightly stretchy and do not ladder.
They are used for swimwear, underwear and geotextiles.

Fabrics can be layered and combined to improve their handle, appearance or performance. For example:
fabric such as Vilene can be stitched or
two or more layers or sheets bonded together
to other fabrics. This reinforces, stiffens and gives strength to collars and cuffs and prevents the fabric from stretching or sagging.
fabric has two or more layers sewn together to give an attractive appearance and added warmth.
can be laminated to another fabric using
a substance which bonds the surfaces of materials together
or heat. Gore-Tex is used for all-weather clothing and shoes because it is breathable and waterproof.
It is important to choose materials that are
. Choosing a fabric with the appropriate quality and cost will ensure that a product will suit the
the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell
and do the job it is intended to do. When making fabric choices, ask yourself the following questions:
derived from animal, vegetable or mineral sources
- should you use woven, knitted or non-woven?

the ability to be pulled out of shape and then recover the original shape. Lycra is a stretch fabric.
It is important to match fabric properties to the requirements of the product. For example:
Cycling jackets need to be made from warm, breathable, elastic, windproof, water-resistant fabric.
Children's jumpers need to be made from soft, colourful, stretchy, warm, easy-care fabric.
Seat belts, airbags or conveyor belts need to be made from strong, durable, flame-resistant materials.
Fire protective clothing needs to be strong, durable, flame- and water-resistant. It may also need to be breathable and elastic.

4008,"Sometimes, rather than rounding off to the nearest whole number, you might need to be a little more accurate. You might need to include some of the digits after the decimal point.
In these cases, we can round off the number up to a certain number of decimal places.
Do not confuse this with rounding off using significant figures (intermediate), as this is slightly different!
The same rules for rounding up apply here:
Write 2.6470588 to 2 decimal places (dp).
? You needed to round up. We want 2 decimal places.
decimal digit is 4. So the number lies between 2.64 and 2.65
The next digit is 7, so we have to round up. So the answer is
, giving your answer correct to one decimal place.
We need one decimal place. That means one number after the decimal point. The 1
number after the decimal point is 8.
This means the answer lies between 7.8 and 7.9
The next digit is 7. This means we have to round up.
Round off the number 3.9762645 to 1 dp.
The number lies between 3.9 and 4.0. The 7 after the 9 means you have to round up. So the answer is
Learn about the dark side of numbers!

1415,"The text may look difficult at first because you probably won't know all the words, but don't worry. If you understand a small number of key words and phrases you should be able to answer the questions.
Read the text at least twice. Get the basic sense of each paragraph by identifying the words you know.
Try to use simple strategies to help you understand, such as similarities with English words (eg
- victory), language patterns (eg 're' in front of a word often gives the idea of 'again', as in:
- I see... again), and words you may have met somewhere else (eg Top 'Sant' is a popular 'health' and fitness magazine.)

1659,"bject. Asteroids or comets on a possible collision course with the Earth are NEOs.
They are difficult to observe because they are smaller, and darker, than planets. But scientists are actively observing many NEOs with telescopes. It is possible to calculate the
(path) of an NEO if enough observations are taken over time.
Asteroid collisions leave craters behind. These are obvious on the Moon, but on the Earth craters are usually eventually weathered away or covered over by natural processes.
Other evidence for past impacts comes from studying layers of rock built up over millions of years. For example, some adjacent layers show abrupt changes in the type and number of fossils. This shows the possible effect on living organisms of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
Iridium is a rare metallic element on Earth, but it is relatively abundant in space. There is a layer of iridium-rich rock dating from around 65 million years ago. This is evidence of an asteroid collision.

Work journal with relevant images and source text
In this student's work journal Sharmin has used secondary images of models to model the clothes and patterns she has designed. Remember that the images you create (primary) or use (secondary) can be manipulated, overlaid, annotated and built upon.
Don't use secondary images too much - it might look as though you are just trying to fill space. There must always be a reason why you have included something in your work journal.
When making use of a secondary image don't forget to
read the text that goes with the picture
because it will certainly contain information that you can include in your work journal. If you are taking images from a newspaper, then read the news item that goes with the picture and make a note of the important points.

6432,"The number of people in a car can only be a whole number: 1, 2, 3, 4... It is not possible to have 3
people in the car. So the number of people in a car is a
The height of a person can take any value, such as 141.35cm, 127.371cm, and so on.
Is shoe size a discrete or continuous variable?
Shoe size is discrete, as it can only take certain values - eg, 4, 4
Is the length of someone's foot a discrete or continuous variable?
The length of someone's foot is continuous, as it can take any value - eg, 17.9cm, 22.452cm, 25cm, etc.
Number recordings are not always exact, and in some cases they may be rounded up.
When a number has been recorded to a certain accuracy - for instance, the nearest 1cm or the closest 10 - you can work out its highest and lowest possible values according to the limits of accuracy provided.
These outcomes are often referred to as an upper or lower bound.
The number of people on a bus is given as 50, correct to the nearest 10. What is the lowest and highest possible number of people on the bus?
The number 50 is correct to the nearest 10.
Looking at the number line, we can see that
is the smallest possible number closest to 50 when rounding up, and
is the largest possible number closest to 50 when rounding down.
So the lower bound is 45, and the upper bound is 54. Therefore, the number of people on the bus can be any number between 45 and 54.
The number of sweets in a jar is given as 70, correct to the nearest 5. What is the smallest and largest possible number of sweets?
The number of sweets is between 68 and 72.
Here's how you break down a question like this.
Find out what number it has been rounded to.
In this case, 70 is rounded to the
Find out the numbers on either side:
Find the smallest number. Half way between 65 and 70 is 67.5. Rounded up, that is
Find the largest number. Half way between 70 and 75 is 72.5. Rounded down, that is
Remember that the lower bound rounds up, and the upper bound rounds down.
You may find it easier to draw a number line to see how the lower and upper bounds can be found.
Can you see that 68 and 72 are the lowest and highest numbers inside the gren lines.
Mary's height is given as 162cm, correct to the nearest cm. Between which limits does Mary's height lie?
161.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 162. 162.5 is the smallest number which rounds up to 163. Therefore, Mary's height must be below 162.5cm. (But remember that it could be 162.4999999999999... cm)
The lower limit is 161.5cm. The upper limit is 162.5cm.
This method can also be applied to problems.
The dimensions of a piece of carpet are given as 127cm x 68cm. Both lengths are correct to the nearest cm. Between what limits does the area of the carpet lie?
We can find the lower and upper limits of both the width and height. The lower limits of width and height will multiply to give the lower limit of the area. And the upper limits will give the upper limit of the area.
The smallest possible area is calculated by multiplying the smallest possible length and width together. The smallest possible area is
The largest possible area is calculated by multiplying the largest possible length and width together. The largest possible area is
, and the upper limit is 8733.75cm
In this right-angled triangle, both measurements are given correct to 1 decimal place (d.p.). What is the smallest possible area of the triangle?
You need to find the lower limits for both measurements, 2.35 and 3.65, and put them into the formula for the area of a triangle. So
Area = 1/2  base  height

1543,"Life was very tough for early settlers and homesteaders on the Great Plains - how did they cope with the
Female homesteader, contemplating her life on the Plains
Early settlers and homesteader on the Plains faced huge problems. The burden of many of these fell on the women, whose lives were burdensome and unpleasant:
There was little wood to build log cabins.
Settlers built 'sod houses', while they lived out of doors - people did their cooking on an open fire.
Outdoor toilets and open wells. The sod houses leaked, and fleas and bedbugs lived in them 'by the million'. It was impossible to disinfect the floor. As a result the death rate, especially from diphtheria, was high.
A 'good thick coat of whitewash' killed bedbugs. 'A layer of clay' stopped leaks. Homesteaders eventually built more modern houses.
There was no wood for fuel, and no shops to buy items such as candles and soap. A typical household had only two buckets, some crockery and one cracked cup. There was no water and little food.
A travelling shoe-maker or tinker might pass through who would provide or mend household items, but usually families just had to make do. The women collected 'buffalo chips' for fuel, stoked the stove, and made their own candles and soap. 'I have often wondered how my mother stood it', wrote an early settler.
No doctors or midwives. No social life 'because of the distances between farmhouses'. In the winter families were shut in 'and longed for spring'.
People had to make the most of any trip to their nearest town, where the women talked of the harvest and the men smoked corncob pipes and talked politics.
Local government was non-existent, and some early lawmen (such as Henry Plummer) were worse than the bandits.
Law courts and sheriffs such as Wyatt Earp slowly established law and order.

577,"> The Tempest Summary - Drunken clowns
Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner.
On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new.
Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan.
Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates).
Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight.
Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano.
Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music.

154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

599,"> Introduction to formulas - Constructing formulas
The advert says that the cost of a party is 50 plus 5 per person, so what would be the cost of a party for 10?
50 + 10  5 = 50 + 50 = 100
What would be the cost of a party for 20?
50 + 20  5 = 50 + 100 =
How do you work out the cost if you don't know the number of people who will attend the party?
The cost for 10 people is 50 + 5  10 = 100
The cost for 20 people is 50 + 5  20 = 150
So the cost for n people is 50 + 5  n = (50 + 5n)
With this formula you can work out the cost of a party for any number of people.
Have a go at the next question to see if you can use
Alexa is 12 years old. How old will she be in n years time?
years time her age will have increased by n. So her age will be n more than it is now.
Check your answer. In 1 years time she will be 13. If we put 1 in for the value of
we get 12 +1 = 13. So that is correct.
In ten years she will be 22, and putting n=10 gives us
age = 12 + 10 = 22

Quadratic sequences - Finding the nth term
Look again at the sequence of square numbers:
Whenever a sequence has a second difference of 2, it will be connected to the sequence of square numbers and the n
term will have something to do with n
term of the sequence 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ... ?
The second difference is 2, so the n
term has something to do with n
The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Our sequence is: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ...
Each term is 2 bigger than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the n
term of the sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ... ?
The second differences are 2, so the formula has something to do with n2.
The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Our sequence is: 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ...
Each term in our sequence is 1 less than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the n

296,"> Writer's tricks - Persuading the reader
The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking.
. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke.
. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts.
Q. What is the effect on my health?
. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause:
nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties
From a Health Development Agency Passive Smoking Information Leaflet
The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours.
Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""?
Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker?
Q3. Name one effect that passive smoking can have on our health, according to the extract.
Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet?
Q5. Give one reason why you think this.
Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous.
Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question?
Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective.
A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'.
A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker.
A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.)
A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important.
A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people.
A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'.
A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text.
A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read.

51,"> Measures of average - Comparing distributions
Complete the following table. The data shows the scores in two tests, English and Maths, across a set of ten students.
In order to see this content you need to have both
If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

Formal and informal writing - The writer's ""voice""
We all have different ways of expressing ourselves in our speech and in our writing. In writing, this is sometimes called voice.
Good writers have a unique voice or style of writing.
Here are two very different styles of writing:
I suppose I could tell you all about where I was born, what it was like when Mum was still around, what happened when I was a little kid, all that kind of stuff, but it's not really relevant.
My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip.
Can you guess which line is from Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations and which one is from Kevin Brooks's novel Martyn Pig?
Charles Dickens's voice is very different to Kevin Brooks's voice. But Kevin Brooks probably wouldn't write to his bank manager in the same voice that he uses to write his stories.

294,"Living things have certain life processes in common. There are seven things that they need to do to count as being alive. The phrase
Making more living things of the same type
It can be easy to tell if something is living or not. A teddy bear might look like a bear, but it can't do any of the seven things it needs to be able to do to count as being alive.
What about a car? A car can move, it gets energy from petrol (like nutrition), it might have a car alarm (sensitivity), and it gets rid of waste gases through its exhaust pipe (excretion). But it can't grow or make baby cars. So a car is not alive.

164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.

Magnets and electric current - Bar magnets
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap
magnets. This means that their magnetism is there all the time and cannot be turned on or off. They have two poles:
The north pole is normally shown as
Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but
is mostly iron, so steel is magnetic too.
If you bring two bar magnets together, there are two things that can happen:
if you bring a north pole and a south pole together, they
if you bring two north poles together, or two south poles together, they
and the magnets push each other away.
We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel.
How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet.
So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels:
You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.

27,". For example, when you push open a door you have to apply a force to the door. You also have to apply a force to pull open a drawer.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the
, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on.
are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.
, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.

Romeo and Juliet first key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death.
The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.
After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting.
Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before.
The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo?
Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him.
Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father.
He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it.
This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood.
When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time.
- Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another.
Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels.
The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language.
""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love""
- Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet.
Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels.
Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'.
He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison.
- Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love.
Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with?
Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work.
Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though.
Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another.
He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted!
- Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo!
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste
Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will.
Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword.
- Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt.

A sunny beach gives you all sorts of possibilities to use your senses. For instance:
The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach
. I looked down the beach towards the blue sea criss-crossed by the white triangles of sails
. The hot sun burned down onto my back and neck
, and the air was heavy with the smells of suntan oil, sea salt and ice cream
. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop
You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale.
Avoid clichs. These are phrases that are used so much that they have lost their power. For instance, if you are ""over the moon"" about something, or ""waiting until the cows come home"", then you are using clichs. Look for original phrases instead.
How could you improve the following sentences?
1) He was scared out of his skin.
2) The trees danced in the breeze.
3) She felt that her heart would break.
1) He felt his fingers uncontrollably tighten and clench together so that his nails dug deep into his palms.
2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling.
3) She knew that she wouldn't be able to speak or even look at him, and she kept blinking back the tears.

22,"> The Tempest Summary - Prospero revealed
Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

299,"> Fractions, Decimals and Percentages - D vs P
Fractions, Decimals and Percentages - D vs P
To convert decimals to percentages multiply by 100.
Similarly, 0.2 becomes 0.2  100% = 20%, and 0.375 becomes 0.375  100% = 37.5%.
If you didn't get the right answers, remember that multiplying by 100 moves every digit two places to the left.

453,"> Speaking - Presentations and reading aloud
Presentations are sometimes less formal than speeches, and you'll probably be asked to present in groups rather than on your own. Use the tips on the previous page to make your performance strong.
Here are some extra tips for group presentations:
Organise the presentation fairly between each group member - ensure that everyone gets their chance to present. If you're shy, don't hide behind your group - you need to take part too!
A group presention needs to come across as a team effort - be careful not to allow over enthusiastic members to dominate.
Work together - if one person is speaking, another person can point to relevant visual aids.
You may be asked to find a poem or an extract from a story to read aloud to your class. Here are some tips to help you with reading aloud:
If you can choose a text you are familiar with this will probably boost your confidence.
Practise your reading using gestures and movement, and don't be tempted to hide behind your book.
Try to look up from your reading several times and make eye contact with your audience.
Vary your pitch and tone and make it relevant to your subject matter. If you're reading something spooky, try to reflect this in your voice. If you're reading a conversation between two characters, attempt to distinguish their voices.
Think about volume and pace - ensure that your audience can hear you clearly.

Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a Russian scientist who investigated conditioning. He discovered that dogs produced extra saliva when they were offered food. This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier.
Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in.
A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a
People and animals can be conditioned to avoid certain things. For example, grazing animals get an unpleasant electric shock when they touch an electric fence. They eventually avoid the fence, even when it is turned off.

316,"Respiration is a chemical reaction that happens in all living cells. It is the way that energy is released from glucose, for our cells to use to keep us functioning.
the same as breathing (which is properly called ventilation).
The glucose and oxygen react together in the cells to produce carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is called
because oxygen from the air is needed for it to work.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration:
(Energy is released in the reaction. We show it in brackets in the equation because energy is not a substance.)
Now we will look at how glucose and oxygen get to the cells so that respiration can take place and how we get rid of the carbon dioxide.
, obtained through digestion of the food we eat. Digestion breaks food down into small molecules. These can be absorbed across the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream.
Glucose is carried round the body dissolved in blood plasma, the pale yellow liquid part of our blood. The dissolved glucose can diffuse into the cells of the body from the
. Once in the cell glucose can be used in respiration.
When we breathe in oxygen enters the small air sacs, called
, in the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from there into the bloodstream.
Oxygen is not carried in the plasma, but is carried by the red blood cells. These contain a red substance called
, which joins onto oxygen and carries it around the body in the blood, then lets it go when necessary. Like glucose, oxygen can diffuse into cells from the capillaries.
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body
Carbon dioxide from cells to the air
The carbon dioxide produced during respiration diffuses out of the cells and into the blood plasma. The blood carries it to the lungs. It then diffuses across the walls of the alveoli and into the air, ready to be exhaled.

We get energy from many different types of energy resources, including fuels, food and stores of energy such as batteries or the wind. We can divide energy resources into two categories:
Non-renewable energy resources cannot be replaced once they are all used up.
Renewable energy resources can be replaced, and will not run out.
On the this page we'll look at non-renewable resources.
are called fossil fuels. They formed millions of years ago from the remains of living things. Coal was formed from plants. Oil and natural gas were formed from sea creatures.
The energy stored in the fossil fuels originally came from
. Plants used light energy from the Sun for
to make their chemicals. This stored chemical energy was transferred to stored chemical energy in animals that ate the plants. When the living things died, they were gradually buried by layers of rock. The buried remains were put under pressure and chemical reactions heated them up. They gradually changed into the fossil fuels.
When the remains of the plants and animals became fossil fuels, their chemical energy was stored in the fuels. The energy is transferred to the surroundings as
Once we have used them all up, they will take millions of years to replace, if they can be replaced at all. For this reason we call fossil fuels

506,"goes roughly through the middle of all the scatter points on a graph. The closer the points are to the line of best fit the stronger the correlation is.
10 pupils in a school study French and German at GCSE. Their marks for a recent test are recorded in the table below:
You can draw a scatter diagram to represent these marks. As Pete was absent on the day of the German test you do not have enough information to mark his score.
Looking at this scatter diagram there is strong positive correlation between the marks in French and the marks in German, so you can draw a line of best fit to show that trend.
Pete scored 70 in French, so using the line of his best fit, you can estimate that his mark in German would have been 72.
A line of best fit can only be drawn if there is strong positive or negative correlation.
The line of best fit does not have to go through the origin.
The line of best fit shows the trend, but it is only approximate and any readings taken from it will be estimations.

129,"Certain texts, especially non-fiction, will be laid out in ways that
, to make information clear, or to help you find what you want to read. You will not be asked to write in detail about how a text is laid out until GCSE, but your teacher may ask you a short question on layout.
Scan over the following text and note down at least four things the writer has done to make it look more interesting and easy to read.
Red Mount Chapel is on a mound on ""The Walks"" in the park.
Red Mount Chapel is a superb example of the Gothic style in architecture and even boasts its own musical ghost!
Built in 1485 at the time of Henry VII, the first Tudor king, it was a stopping-off place for pilgrims on their way to Walsingham via the port of King's Lynn. Octagonal in shape, it is very small, and had three floors. The top floor is a chapel with fan tracery much like that in Cambridge's King's College.
Underneath the chapel building there is reputed to be a long tunnel (not unusual), running to Castle Rising - a distance of 18km/12 miles (very unusual). An unfortunate, drunken fiddler once decided to explore the dark passageway with his instrument, his dog and his pint! He never reached the end of the tunnel, wherever it went, but his spirit remains and can be heard on occasions playing his tunes and singing, accompanied by the whining of his poor dog!
writing of the heading and unusual font catches our attention.
writing is used for the subheadings, which list the location details.
These details are separated from the rest of the text so they are easy to follow.
The most interesting fact, about the haunting, is mentioned first, and kept in a short paragraph of its own.
An image of the haunted tunnel is used to draw the reader's attention.
subheading is used to draw attention to ""Places of Interest in the Neighbourhood"".
These places are listed, using bullet points to make them clear.

SECTION 2 - Act 3, Scene 1 (whole scene)
There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed 
And he's composed of harshness! I must remove
Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget 
 But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
, who watches from a distance, unseen.
Work not so hard! I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down, and rest you. When this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study. Pray, now, rest yourself.
The sun will set before I shall discharge
I'll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that:
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
As well as it does you  and I should do it
With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
No, noble mistress. 'Tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you 
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers 
I have broke your hest to say so!
Indeed the top of admiration  worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard, and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues
Have I liked several women  never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,
And put it to the foil. But you  o you,
So perfect and so peerless  are created
One of my sex  no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
I am skilless of  but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you 
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly, and my father's precepts
A prince, Miranda: I do think, a King
I would not so!  and would no more endure
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service  there resides,
To make me slave to it  and for your sake
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event,
If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief! I,
Beyond all limit of what else i'the world,
To weep at what I am glad of.
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
What I desire to give; and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling 
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife if you will marry me:
If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
(He kneels) And I thus humble ever.
As bondage e'er of freedom! Here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell
So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised with all  but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book 
For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform

Collecting and recording data - Continuous data
. Examples include time, height and weight.
Because continuous data can take any value, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. So
before it can be represented in a frequency table or statistical diagram.
When choosing groups for the data, make sure that each piece of data can be placed in one (and only one) of the groups.
You are investigating the length of time each member of a class spends on the internet per week. Look at the class groupings below - do you think they are right?
, because the times of '10 hours' and '20 hours' can be entered into two different groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can be entered into 0  time 10 (where time is less than or equal to 10 hours), and also into 10  time  20 (where time is more than or equal to 10 hours).
, because the times '10 hours' and '20 hours' cannot be entered into any of the groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can neither be entered into 0 < time < 10 (where time is less than 10 hours), nor can it be entered into 10 < time < 20 (where time is more than 10 hours).
'10 hours' is included in the second group, but not the first and '20 hours' is included in the third group, but not the second.

174,"To divide a large number by a 1-digit number you can set it out like this:
7 goes into 9 once with 2 remaining (remainder 2), so put a 1 above the 9 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
7 goes into 26 three times, remainder 5, so put 3 over the 6 and carry 5 to the hundreds column.
7 goes into 54 seven times, remainder 5 so put 7 over the 4 and have a remainder of 5.
So 964  7 = 137 remainder 5
We write this with an 'r' for 'remainder', so it looks like this:
964  7 = 137 r 5

> The rock cycle - Igneous rocks
The second type of rock we'll look at is igneous rock.
The inside of the Earth is very hot - hot enough to melt rocks. Molten (liquid) rock forms when rocks melt. The molten rock is called
. When the magma cools and solidifies, a type of rock called igneous rock forms.
Igneous rocks contain randomly arranged interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten magma solidified. The more
You may have done an experiment at school with a substance called salol. If molten salol cools slowly, you get big crystals. If it cools quickly, you get small crystals.
If the magma cools quickly, small crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma erupts from a volcano. Obsidian and basalt are examples of this type of rock. They are called
igneous rocks because they form from eruptions of magma.
If the magma cools slowly, large crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma cools deep underground. Granite and gabbro are examples of this type of rock. They are
igneous rocks because they form from magma underground.
Unlike sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks do not contain any fossils. This is because any fossils in the original rock will have melted when the magma formed.

429,"> Paragraphs - Why paragraphs are used
There are two main reasons why paragraphs are used:
To show a new speaker is talking.
Without paragraphs, texts would be very confusing.
Have a look at this extract from Louis Sachar's novel, 'Holes'.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign. ""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said. Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""

101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =

30,"Atoms of different elements can join together in chemical reactions to form compounds. For example
are elements. They react together to form
There are countless different ways for the elements to join together, and millions of compounds are known.
The properties of compounds are usually very different from the properties of the elements they contain. For example hydrogen and oxygen are both gases at room temperature, but water is a liquid.
The reaction between iron and sulfur to make
is often used in school to study elements and compounds. Look at the animation to remind you what happens in this reaction.
A test tube is filled with a mixture of iron and sulfur.
The table compares the properties of iron and sulfur (the two elements), and iron sulfide (the compound).
The atoms in a compound are chemically joined together by strong forces called
. You can only separate the elements in a compound using another chemical reaction. Separation methods like filtration and distillation will not do this.
Compounds form when atoms join together in a chemical reaction

The rock cycle - Erosion and transport
Weathering and erosion are often confused, so be careful when answering questions about them.
is the movement of the broken pieces away from the site of weathering.
For example, a basalt cliff may be weathered by freeze-thaw, a type of physical weathering. This means that pieces of the cliff may break away.
Erosion happens when these pieces of rock fall away down the cliff.
In the photograph you can see a basalt cliff. At the bottom there are heaps of rocks, caused by weathering then erosion.
Rivers and streams can move pieces of rock. This is called
. Fast flowing rivers can transport large rocks, but slow moving rivers can only transport tiny pieces of rock.
As the pieces of rock are carried along by the water, they bash against each other and the river bed. They gradually wear away because of this. They become smaller and more rounded.

620,"> Acids, bases and metals - Introduction
Acids, bases, alkalis and metals are found in the laboratory and at home. They can be irritant or corrosive and must be handled carefully.
How acid or alkaline a chemical is can be measured on the pH scale, using indicators like litmus and universal indicator. Acids and bases react together to form salts and other products too.

458,"Making the Great Barrier Reef Even Greater
The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is the largest marine park in the world. It covers about 135,100 square miles. Recently, the Australian government added another 386 miles to the park.
The Great Barrier Reef is a series of coral reefs that were formed by billions of tiny creatures called
. As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps then live on top of the polyp shells. Over thousands of years, the polyp shells form a reef.
The Great Barrier Reef acts as a barrier for the northeastern coast of Australia. The reef prevents waves from slamming into the coastline and
, or washing away, too much land. It also provides a home for fish and other animals, including the dugong, a large mammal.
A colony of coral polyps can grow as much as 4 inches in a year.
Reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are under stress. Pollution and disease are killing the polyps, and tourists take pieces of coral. Reefs are also damaged by ships and fishing nets, which break off sections of coral.
The damage is widespread, experts say. According to one report, by the World Resources Institute, more than half the world's reefs are at risk.
Australian government officials hope by expanding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, they will help protect the reef and its inhabitants.
The expansion of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will protect both the reef and an endangered marine animal called the
The plant-eating dugong is a cousin of the manatee, or sea cow, which is found in the warm waters of Florida. The dugong lives in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The average dugong is about 9 feet long and weighs up to 600 pounds.
Hunted for its meat and skin, the dugong is also losing habitat to construction and pollution.

185,"As the clock ticks down toward Thanksgiving, the Macy's Parade Studio buzzes with activity. The sounds of saws, drills, and hammers echo through the former Tootsie Roll factory in New Jersey.
The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade.
Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade.
The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities.
""We don't do anything small,"" Piper tells me.
The first giant balloon to fly in the Macy's parade was Felix the Cat, in 1927.
The parade has featured 170 giant balloons in its history. No more than 15 balloons are used each year.
Kermit the Frog stretches 78 feet, making it the longest balloon in this year's parade.
A record six different Snoopy character balloons have appeared in the parade over the years.
In 1957, a massive downpour caused the Popeye balloon to dump gallons of water on spectators below.
To prove his point, Piper leads me up two flights of stairs. Here, Macy's balloon experts-called ""balloonatics""-work their magic. In one area hang models of the parade's newest giant balloons. The balloons include ""Strike
Up the Band"" Barney, Sesame Street's Super Grover, and an all-new Garfield.
Garfield has flown in 15 Macy's parades, but this year he will have a friend-his teddy bear, Pooky.
In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City.
Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float.
Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars.
All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City.
Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together.""

300,"If two heads are better than one, a newly discovered turtle is head and shoulders above other turtles. May Toro found a two-headed turtle in Florida. ""I was shocked. I couldn't believe it,"" Toro said after she picked up the turtle.
Toro works for Mary Kraus, who studies turtles. Kraus says she has seen the eggs of two headed turtles before. However, she has never seen a living two-headed turtle. ""This is the first time I've ever seen one alive, fully developed, and hatched,"" Kraus said.
The two-headed turtle is a loggerhead turtle. The U.S. government says the loggerhead turtle is an endangered species. Loggerhead turtles can grow to be 3 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds!
After studying the turtle for a couple of days, Toto and Kraus let the turtle go. ""We didn't want it to become a freak in a freak show"", Kraus said.

130,"For some schools, protecting the environment starts in the classroom.
Fifth graders at Carolina International School (CIS) have a goal this Earth Dayto throw away as little trash as possible during lunch. To get their message across, students will encourage their peers to recycle. ""I celebrate Earth Day every day,"" Nirvanna Madho, 10, told
. ""I really don't throw anything away.""
Participating in a zero-waste lunch is just one of many ways students at the school in Harrisburg, North Carolina, work to better the environment. Each April, the school organizes an Earth Day event. Students rotate through stations set up across the school's 36-acre campus, which includes forests and
Wetlands are moisture-rich lowland areas such as swamps or marshes. Students take part in hands-on environmental activities from testing water quality to checking out the latest models of battery-operated cars.
This year, Earth Day at CIS kicks off a season of change. The school is preparing to go ""green"" with a major construction project, set to begin early next year. Being green means protecting the world and its resources. The school's Earthfriendly makeover will include outdoor
or sun-powered, lighting and rooftop gardens. A water recycling system and other features to protect natural resources will also be built. The lobby will include a flat-panel touch screen on which students can watch how energy is being
""It's very important to educate children about environmental issues,"" says principal Deanna Duncan. ""If we don't take care of [Earth], there isn't another one.""
CIS is just one of hundreds of schools in the United States that are going green. A
is built with recycled and environmentally friendly materials. Green schools are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings.
The majority of the energy supply in the United States comes from the burning of
such as oil, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels were formed from the remains of prehistoric animals and plants. People use fossil fuels when they drive their cars, heat their homes, and power farms, factories, and cities.
Though people depend on fossil fuels, those energy sources have their drawbacks. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air and releases gases that contribute to global warmingthe gradual rise in Earth's average temperature.
Hoover Dam generates clean energy by using water to spin turbines.
Fossil fuels are gradually being used up. To conserve them, scientists are looking to
sources. Renewable energy is power from sources that can't be used up and do not pollute the environment. Water, wind, and solar power are types of renewable energy.
President George W. Bush announced an energy plan that calls on lawmakers to ensure that ecofriendly fuels are developed and made easily available to Americans. Gas is a fossil fuel used in cars, and the price to fill up a gas tank is rising. Gas costs about $3 a gallon in some parts of the United States.
At CIS, students are excited for construction to begin on their new school building. ""I think the school is going to be a lot better,"" Drew Barsody, 10, told
""I'm looking forward to seeing the solar panels.""
These wind turbines convert wind into electricity.
Here are some common environmentally friendly energy alternatives.
Solar Power: Solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat and electricity. California and Arizona are two states that use solar power. One drawback of solar power is that energy can't be collected if the sun isn't shining.
Energy produced from windmills is used to generate electricity. The amount of electricity generated from wind has been growing in recent years, tripling since 1998 in the United States. Electricity is produced from wind in 30 states, including California, Texas, and Iowa.
is one of the oldest sources of energy. Hydropower often comes from dams or waterfalls. Of all renewable energy sources, it is most often used to generate electricity. In 2004, it accounted for 7 percent of all the electricity generated in the United States.
Ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that can power cars. It is created from several sources, such as corn crops. Typically, a small amount of ethanol is combined with gasoline to fuel vehicles. That helps decrease the fuel's cost and harmful emissions.
Turning off the lights when you leave a room is one way to conserve energy. What are some other ways to save energy?

661,"Take a time trip with tomorrows talking robots, dolphinlike boats, and more!
Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

362,"Some people get alligators and crocodiles mixed up. But they are very different. Here are a few of the differences between the two kinds of reptiles.

An alligator has a broad, flat snout. It is not as fierce as a crocodile.

655,"February 27 was a sad day in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the children's television program
, lost a brief battle with stomach cancer. He died at age 74 at his home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
""He was so genuinely, genuinely kind, a wonderful person,"" said David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on the show.
Fred Rogers touched generations of children. His show became public television's longest-running program. It was produced for more than 30 years-from 1968 to 2001-and continues to air in reruns.
On each show, Mr. Rogers welcomes viewers by taking off his jacket and shoes and putting on a cardigan sweater and sneakers. One of his cardigans hangs in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C.
A Presbyterian minister, Mr. Rogers taught kids the importance of self-worth with his trademark line, ""I like you just the way you are.""
Mr. Rogers didn't consider himself a TV star. ""I always thought I was a neighbor who just came in for a visit.""

59,"A large storm is brewing in space. In a few days, that storm should sweep past Earth. Don't worry; the storm shouldn't cause any damage. It is a meteor shower.
The meteor shower will take place on November 18 and 19. The shower is called the Leonid meteor shower. That's because most of the meteors will appear to come from the
Leo the lion. A constellation is a group of stars that seems to make a picture.
Meteors are also known as falling stars. They are called falling stars because some people used to think that meteors were stars falling from the sky.
Today, we know that meteors are bits of dust and rock from space. As a meteor speeds through the atmosphere, friction causes it to heat up. The meteor gets so hot that it glows and appears to streak through the sky as it moves.
The dust that forms the Leonid meteor shower came from a comet. A comet is a large ball of frozen dust and gas that
, or goes around, the sun. When a comet comes close to the sun, it begins to melt. Dust from the comet streams into space and over time spreads out along the comet's path around the sun.
The dust that forms the Leonid meteor shower comes from the comet Tempel-Tuttle. It orbits the sun about once every 33 years.
On November 18 and 19, Earth will pass through comet Tempel-Tuttle's orbit. The meteor shower will take place in North America on the 19th. But only the early bird will catch it. The peak of the shower will take place at 5:30 a.m.
Don't worry about any of the Leonids falling on you. They will all burn up high in Earth's atmosphere. You won't need an umbrella.

456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

499,"Julie, age 9, looked serious as she described what happened to her recently while riding on the bus to school. ""My mom and I had bought these shoes that I really liked,"" Julie told
. ""But then these kids started teasing me about them. I felt embarrassed. After that, I didn't want to take the bus anymore.""
This graph comes from a survey that asked kids and parents about some of the toughest issues facing kids today.
Scenes like that take place every day at bus stops, on school buses, on school playgrounds, and in other places. A recent survey found that 55 of every 100 kids between ages 8 and 11 said bullying and teasing are a ""big problem"" for kids their age.
The survey results also show that 74 percent of kids between ages 8 and 11 said they have seen bullying in their school. The survey was conducted by Children Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Nickelodeon.
of someone that takes place over a period of time,"" said Ronald Stephens. To
means to constantly pester or threaten someone. Stephens heads the National Center for School Safety, which works to prevent violence in schools.
Bullying can take many forms, such as hitting, name-calling, threatening looks, and spoken threats, Stephens said. ""Bullying can have long-term effects,"" he said, ""including the 'vigilante effect.'"" A
is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said.
Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there.
Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased.
School safety experts say everyone in a school, as well as parents, must work together to make sure no kids are disrespected or treated cruelly.
To stop bullying, some schools have organized
. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers.
Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them.
Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said.
Ronald Stephens, of the National Center for School Safety, gives these three tips to remember if you are ever bullied:
If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then...
Find an adult (teacher, parent, coach) and tell that adult what happened.

232,"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell.
The Liberty Bell is about to get a new home. This fall, it will move from its current location at Liberty Bell Pavilion in Philadelphia to a new building down the street.
Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs.
Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack.
During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change.
""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper.
In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776.
This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco.
The last time the Liberty Bell changed location was in 1976.
At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there.
The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday.

445,"This poster for Hispanic Heritage Month in 2002 represents Strength in Unity, Faith and Diversity.
What do Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, and Cameron Diaz have in common? Not only are they all celebrities, but they are also all
Those celebrities are part of the rapidly growing Hispanic American population in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic Americans now make up the largest minority group in the country. A
Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos.
As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people.
Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American.
Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15.
People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countrys history.
Ellen Ochoa, the first Hispanic American astronaut, told
that to understand the history of the United States, people should learn about the contributions of different groups, including Hispanic Americans.
People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong.
From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people.
Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico. In 1990, she became the first Hispanic American to serve as the U.S. surgeon general. That is the doctor who leads our country on health issues. She worked to improve healthcare for Americans, especially children, women, and minorities.
Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including
Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides
, are popular with many young readers.
In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAs training program. Ochoa, whose fathers parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight.
Why is celebrating a variety of cultures important?

141,"Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

689,"Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins.
A great white shark cruised across the Indian Ocean in a record-breaking swim. The great white became the first shark known to complete a round-trip journey between two continents.
""This is the first time that an individual fish has been found to go across an entire ocean and come back to the same spot,"" says Ramn Bonfil, one of the scientists who studied the shark. Scientists named the shark Nicole, after Australian actor Nicole Kidman.
Nicole not only set a distance record but also took a bite out of the speed record. The great white clocked more than 12,400 miles on her trip from South Africa to Australia and back. She
or moved between locations, faster than any other marine animal.
The map shows Nicoles route between South Africa and Australia.
Great whites live mainly off the coasts of California, South Africa, and Australia. Nicoles 99-day journey was tracked with an electronic tag placed on her fin.
The tag recorded her movements, including how deep she dove in the water. The results stunned scientists. They discovered that there is more interaction among great white populations in Africa and Australia than had previously been thought.
The new find is helping scientists learn more about how sharks migrate and
(find their way). Why might Nicole have swum so far so fast? Scientists dont know for sure, but they think one of the reasons that she may have made the trip was a search for food. Great white sharks feed mainly on whales, seals, and fish.
And how did Nicole find her way from one continent to another? Although she frequently plunged to depths of more than one-half mile, Nicole spent most of her time swimming on the surface. That led scientists to suspect that great whites might use the sun and the moon to help navigate.
The recent discoveries have excited shark lovers. ""Its clear that we have only uncovered the tip of the iceberg,"" says Bonfil. ""There is still much to learn about great white shark migrations.""
Great whites arent the only big fish in the sea. There are about 370 species, or types, of sharks. Here are some sharks that make a splash.
The whale shark grows up to 40 feet long and weighs about 15 tons. Thats heavier than two elephants!
The dwarf lantern shark is thought to be one of the smallest sharks. It is about 6 inches long.
Although most sharks swim about 1.5 miles per hour (mph), the mako shark is thought to cruise around at 22 mph.
The dusky shark has the most powerful bite. Its jaws clamp together with 132 pounds of force.

180,"You've probably heard the old saying, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" If a scientist has his way, in the near future, apples and other fruits and vegetables will help keep millions of kids worldwide healthier than ever.
Scientist Charles Arntzen wants to alter fruits and vegetables so that they will contain a
to fight diseases. A vaccine helps a person's body fight diseases. Vaccinations have helped eliminate many diseases in the the United States and other countries.
Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations.
That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well.

89,"Fingerprint technology has a new home  in the cafeteria.
Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a students fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The students picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents arent happy with the new system. Some students dont use the fingerprint scanner because their parents dont like the idea that their childrens fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students fingerprint information is secure.

583,"Germany, Chile, and Liberia elect their first female leaders.
Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.
Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge.
Johnson-Sirleaf vows to unite Liberia and create jobs.
The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce
or joblessness, in her country. ""We want to give people hope of having jobs,"" she says.
As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countrys rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer.""
Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberias first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war.
Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs.
or bring back together, her country. ""I am excited by the potential of what I representthe aspirations and expectations of women in Liberia, African women, and women all over the world,"" she said in her inauguration speech.
Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll.
Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election.

213,"A spacecraft zooms toward Pluto and beyond to learn more about the solar system.
will capture photos from Pluto. It will also gather information from objects in the Kuiper Belt, the mysterious region on the fringes of our solar system.
Very little is known about Pluto, currently the farthest planet from the sun. The tiny planet is one-sixth the size of Earth. It is more than 3 billion miles away, much too far to be seen in detail with a telescope from Earth. Pluto is the only planet that has not been explored by a spacecraftuntil now.
In late January, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched the
spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The space probe is now speeding toward Pluto. ""The United States of America has just made history by launching the first spacecraft to explore Pluto,"" mission expert Alan Stern said at launch time.
or scientists who study space, hope they will soon have much more information about the planet that lies on the edge of our solar system. New Horizons will fly by Pluto to take photos and study the icy planet. All the information it gathers will be beamed back to Earth.
will reach Pluto in July 2015. The 1,054-pound spacecraft will get as close as 6,200 miles from Plutos surface.
which is about the size of a grand piano, will also use its powerful cameras to capture images of Plutos moon, Charon. The probe will then zoom beyond Pluto and take pictures of the
The Kuiper Belt is a region that orbits the sun in the far reaches of the solar system. It is filled with thousands of rocky, icy objects.
Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper Belt are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago. Researchers hope the images will provide clues to how the solar system was created.
The nine and a half years it will take
to reach Pluto will be a long wait for scientists, but they say it will be worth it. ""This is one of the most important regions of the solar system,"" says mission expert Hal Weaver. ""It hasnt been explored yet, and
is going to be the first mission to go out there and look at it up close and personal.""

188,"When I stepped inside the old Mission Control room at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, I felt like a kid again. Even though the computers had long been shut off, I knew I was experiencing a piece of history.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used this control room when the United States first sent humans to the moon. The room also served as the center for dozens of other space missions.
""This room was used from the Gemini missions all the way through to the space shuttle in the early 1990s,"" said NASA's Gary Kitmacher, my guide.
The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon.
My tour brought back many memories. I remember watching Neil Armstrong take ""one giant leap for mankind"" on my parent's television. In 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon.
A year later, I was glued to the television again. This time, scientists in this very room were trying to figure out how to get the astronauts of Apollo 13 back home when an oxygen tank exploded aboard their craft.
In the same building as the old Mission Control room is the new Mission Control room. Here, scientists keep tabs on the International Space Station (ISS) that orbits above Earth.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of walking on the moon. Walk-ing through Johnson Space Center--some 30 years later--is the next best thing.
The Saturn V rocket used to launch astronauts to the moon is located outside Johnson Space Center in Houston.
In 1965, the Gemini 7 spacecraft makes its historic mission.
Sixteen countries, including the United States, are building the International Space Station.

316,"The Internet is not the only place where you should be careful with strangers. Here are some tips to keep in mind when you're on a street:
Always go with a friend when walking or riding your bike to school.
Walk or ride in well-lighted areas and never take shortcuts.
Stay with a group when waiting at a bus stop.
If anyone bothers you on your way to or from school, tell an adult immediately.
Never get into a car driven by someone you don't know.

501,"Just in time for Black History Month, President George Bush has signed a law to build a national museum honoring African Americans.
The National Museum of African American History and Culture will be part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It will include exhibits on slavery and other important periods in black history.
Getting approval for the museum was no easy task.In fact, politicians and leaders worked for almost 100 years to get the bill signed. ""This has been a long, hard effort, but we're here today,"" one government official told

651,"Fall is here, and lots of boys and girls are hitting the football field. Playing football can be lots of fun, but it can also be dangerous. Kids need to play safely to make sure they have fun and do not get hurt.
Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality.
Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players.
Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle.
Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine.
Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice:
Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury.
Leagues should have rules that require kids to take time off from playing after they have suffered an injury-especially a head injury.
To make sure they are safe, kids should always wear the proper safety equipment when playing any sport.

222,"Part of Hawaiis coastline collapses, pouring lava into the Pacific Ocean.
Lava from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii hits the sea.
Tourists watched in awe as a huge chunk of Hawaiis coastline broke off and fell into the ocean. More than 44 acres of coastline collapsed and sent a glowing swirl of red-hot
bursting from a cliff. Lava is liquid rock that comes from a volcano.
The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water.
""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone.
Kilauea, the worlds most active volcano, on Hawaiis Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way.
The recent collapse didnt surprise scientists. They had issued a warning months earlier because the cliff had formed cracks. Land collapses are not uncommon in the area. In 1996, a 26-acre area collapsed into the ocean, and in 1999, 25 acres of unsteady land fell into the water.
Thin strands of wiry volcanic glass, called Peles hair, were found about 2,000 feet away. Peles hair is a type of
which forms from lava that cools and hardens. According to myth, Pele was the Hawaiian goddess of fire.

676,"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed.
Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground.
""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka.
Elephants' sharp senses may have warned them about the tsunami.
Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo.
In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly.
Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and
to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals.
Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen.
""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told
. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people.
Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up
. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear.
""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first
would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction.
Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee.
How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven.
Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee.
In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami.
Scientists say that elephants can pick up vibrations from earthquakes through their broad feet.
Elephants' toenails are in the skin and not attached to the toes.
Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground.
In what other ways might animals' sharp senses be helpful?

to thank. The rovers--each the size of a golf cart--successfully touched down on opposite sides of the Red Planet in January.
Now NASA scientists have even more reason to celebrate. They recently announced that
found hard evidence that Mars' dry surface was once ""soaking wet.""
""We have concluded the rocks here were once soaked in liquid water,"" said NASA scientist Steve Squyres. The finding is important to scientists because clues of water could mean that life once existed on Mars.
Both rovers are equipped with instruments to help scientists study the rocks. Each rover has a robotic arm that drills into the rocks and cameras that snap photographs.
detected minerals called sulfates in the rocks. Sulfates form in the presence of water. The rover also found ""blueberries"" scattered throughout the rock.
Blueberries are what NASA calls small balls of mineral that can form in water or be created by a volcano. Because Mars' blueberries are mixed in the rock instead of sprinkled on top, scientists believe that the blueberries were formed by water, not volcanoes.
Now that scientists have received postcards from the Red Planet, when will the care package arrive? NASA has tentatively planned an unmanned mission to Mars about ten years from now that will bring back rocks for scientists to study.

78,"After school, would you rather do your homework or play computer and video games? If you are like many kids, you have to finish your homework before you can play games. In some schools, however, teachers are actually assigning video games as homework!
The third graders at Prairie View Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, play special computer games for homework. Students spend at least 20 minutes four times a week playing the games. Each game is based on their schoolwork.
Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says the games help kids learn. Other educators agree.
""The kids love it,"" said Joy Davis, a principal at a school where the games are given as homework. ""If you can get students where they think they're learning and playing, it has hit the magic mark,"" she said.
Kids like to play the computer games. ""I like it because it's challenging, and when I mess up I do it over and over again,"" student Adel Ahmed said.
Lightspan, a company in San Diego, California, designs the games. More than 4,000 schools in 46 states use them. The games have helped a few schools increase scores on standardized tests. The new games might even improve grades, and kids say the games are fun.
According to fourth grader Osley Galvez, playing learning games is better than doing homework the old way. ""With this, you play with the controls. It's fun!""

134,"Kim Corbin of California skips everywhere she goes. She skips to work, she skips to the store, and she skips home. As she skips around town, Corbin shouts, ""Skippers, skip on!""
Corbin got hooked on skipping in April 1999 when she began skipping with a friend. As she skipped, she thought, ""This is happiness.""
Since that time, Corbin has founded her own organization dedicated to getting people to skip. So far, 1,000 people in 32 cities have become skipping enthusiasts.
Soon, Corbin will skip into classrooms across the United States. She plans to take her message that skipping is a fun and healthful activity to school-children in 38 states.
Corbin says skipping can be part of an exercise program. She wants to get kids and their parents to skip and do other exercises together. Corbin has lost 25 pounds since she started skipping two years ago.
Corbin says that she makes skipping into a game. ""Just sneak in five steps wherever you are, and no one is even going to notice it,"" she advised.

84,"Leaping lizards! Harry Potter is about to fly onto movie screens across the United States. The new movie is called
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
At the beginning of the movie, Dobby the house elf warns Harry that if he returns to Hogwarts, disaster will follow. Real problems begin when someone starts turning Hogwarts students into stone.
Recently, Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who plays Harry Potter, took time out from filming to talk to
. Here's what he had to say.
: How is Chamber of Secrets different from the first movie?
: Harry changes a lot in the second film. In the first film, Harry learns about hate. In the second film, he learns how to deal with hate and has to explore his own emotions. He learns that he has something in common with Lord Voldemort, and he has to cope with that.
: Did you learn any new skills?
: I learned how to sword fight. But Rupert [another child actor in the movie] learned how to drive a car for the flying-car scene. Unfortunately, I didn't get to learn to drive because I was in the passenger seat. We try to make it look realistic.
: How did you film the movie and go to school at the same time?
: I go to school three hours a day, every day. I have a fantastic teacher.
: How have your friends and family reacted to your fame?
: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry.
: In what ways has your life changed since the first movie came out?
: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that.
: When you grow up, do you want to continue acting?
: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes.
If you could play a role in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which role would you play? Why?
: What have you learned about making movies that you didn't know before you played Harry Potter?
: It's hard work. It is a lot of fun, but at the same time it's really a challenge.
: If you could play another character in the movie, who would you like to play?
: I would like to play Gilderoy Lockhart.

423,"Hua Mei isn't your typical California girl. Sure, she likes to eat, sleep, sit in her pool, and play. On hot days, she really likes to sit in her air-conditioned room. After all, Hua Mei is covered with black-and-white fur and weighs 150 pounds!
Hua Mei is a giant panda who celebrated her second birthday last week. Born on August 21, 1999, at the San Diego Zoo in California, Hua Mei is the only giant panda born in the United States to live more than four days.
When she was born, Hua Mei looked like a pink rat the size of a cell phone. She weighed only 4 ounces.
For two weeks after Hua Mei was born, her mother, Bai Yun, held on to her without ever letting go. Bai Yun was careful because she didn't want to crush Hua Mei. At the time, Bai Yun weighed 200 pounds!
Since Hua Mei's birth, millions of people have seen her. Thousands of people flock to her den each day.
""She's so cute,"" Rebecca Ralston, age 11, said after seeing the panda. ""She's like a big teddy bear.""
The giant panda is one of the rarest animals. As few as 1,000 pandas survive in the wild.
Giant pandas live only in the bamboo forests of China, which are being destroyed. Loggers have cut down vast areas of those forests. The trees are used for firewood and to make buildings. Farmers use the cleared forests to grow crops.
To protect the giant panda, China has set up 33
, or special protected areas. It is illegal to cut down trees and brush or hunt in the reserves. The reserves are helping to increase the number of pandas living in the wild.
Panda scientists at the San Diego Zoo say they want to help increase the number of pandas living in the wild. ""Someday, we may be able to raise pandas in captivity and release them to the wild,"" panda scientist Don Lyndberg told Weekly Reader. For now, pandas remain on the edge of extinction.

472,"Experts hope 2006 will be the year the world is polio-free.
Will polio be declared a disease of the past?
World health groups are fighting a war
with a crippling and sometimes deadly diseasepolio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report.
Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were
for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk.
The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio
mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think well get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told
She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria.""
Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly
disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havent been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims.
With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine.
A boy in Africa receives an oral polio vaccine from a WHO (World Health Organization) worker.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to
or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been
Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door.
To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November.
After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Its uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives.""
Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization.
Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why?
Jonas Salk inspects the vaccine that helped end polio.
From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Roosevelts death, Salks vaccine was declared officially safe.
In October 2005for the first time in 26 years in the United Statesfive children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnt at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person.

64,"Environmental experts are working hard to clean up beaches in Spain. Spain and Portugal are two countries in Europe. Some of their beaches are covered with oil that leaked from a tanker called the
A storm with high winds and waves pounded the tanker in the middle of November. During the storm, the
began to leak. Nearly 2 million gallons of oil leaked into the Atlantic Ocean.
Oil from the tanker formed a huge slick on the ocean. Much of the oil washed up on nearby beaches. It covered at least 150 miles of coastline, killing fish, birds, and other animals. Some experts say cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches could take years.
A few days after the tanker began leaking oil, it broke in half. After the tanker broke apart, its
, or front, remained on the ocean surface for several hours. The ship sank about 150 miles off the coast of Spain.
About 18 million gallons of oil are still inside the ship. The weight of the ocean water pressing on the ship could cause the oil tanks on the ship to explode, spewing oil across the ocean floor. Even if the oil tanks don't explode, they will rust and leak.
""[The ship is] a time bomb at the bottom of the sea,"" said one expert. ""There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil.""

566,"This map might not lead to a pot of gold, but officials at the Library of Congress consider it very valuable. The Library of Congress recently paid $10 million for the first map to name America. Printed in 1507, the map is the only copy of its kind left in the world.
Officials said the map is the most expensive item that the library has ever purchased. The library raised most of the money from Congress and other groups.
America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer. The map showing America was kept in a castle in Germany for 350 years and was rediscovered in 1901.

6,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis is riding the wristband wave. Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she told
since she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. That is a substance that the body needs to help convert
, a sugar in food, into energy.
With the help of her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, Sydney ordered blue wristbands with the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today.""
The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City.

108,"Map of Washington, D.C.: The World War II memorial is located between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.
Francis Campane and his wife took a train trip from Connecticut to Washington, D.C., in the spring. They were headed to the nation's capital to visit the newly opened National World War II Memorial.
is a special monument that honors a person, a group of people, or an event. The World War II memorial opened in April. It was built to honor the 16 million men and women who had served in the armed forces during World War II (1939-1945).
The trip was especially meaningful to Campane, 80, because he is a World War II
. Veterans are people who have served in the armed forces. Campane served in the U.S. Navy during the war. He was stationed aboard a ship called the U.S.S.
""I was amazed at the memorial and the gratitude the American people have shown World War II veterans,"" Campane told
. ""It's great to know our generation will be remembered.""
A plaza, a reflecting pool, fountains, and stone arches are among the memorial's main features. A wall of gold stars at the memorial honors the more than 400,000 Americans killed in the war.

The World War II memorial is one of many places across the country where people will remember the U.S. military on November 11. That is Veterans Day--a holiday set aside to honor our nation's armed forces.

590,"Hawaiian monk seals may be headed for extinction.
Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main
or natural home. Longenecker and other researchers think the seals are not getting enough food, and they are desperately trying to figure out why. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

132,"Aquarius: An Underwater Lab With A View
Many U.S. kids share their bedrooms with a brother or sister. Sharing a room can be a pain. In October, six scientists squeezed into a small underwater laboratory to study a coral reef. They worked and slept in the tiny space for ten days. They, too, found that sharing space isn't easy.
""I've been on missions where people snored,"" said Celia Smith, who led the mission in October. ""You just kind of kick their bunk and try to get to sleep before they do.""

says the best part of living there is the view. They can see colorful fish swimming in the nearby reef. Smith said it's hard to tell, though, whether the aquanauts are watching the fish or the fish are watching the aquanauts.
The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.
Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.
Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.
Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.
Overfishing, pollution, and global warming are destroying many coral reefs, scientists explain. For example, global warming has gradually warmed the shallow ocean waters where coral reefs usually form. The warmer water has killed many
, the tiny plants that give coral reefs their color and provide nourishment to the animals that form reefs.
Scientist Valerie Paul worries that all the world's coral reefs will be destroyed early this century. ""It is like losing the rain forests all at once,"" she said.

358,"A young mountain climber sets his sights on the world's tallest mountains.
Jordan Romero celebrated his 10th birthday in a way he'll never forget. Last summer, the fifth grader from Big Bear Lake, California, became the youngest person to climb Kilimanjaro in Africa. ""I knew I could make it to the top,"" Jordan told
Kilimanjaro is one of the Seven Summits. The
are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. With one down and the rest to go, Jordan plans to hike to all the summits in the next few years. This April, he will tackle Mount Kosciusko (kah-zee-UHS-koh) in Australia. The map shows the order and years in which Jordan plans to climb the summits.

424,"In September, city officials in Punta Arenas, Chile, warned people to stay out of the sun. Chile is a country in South America. The warning didn't come just because it was a sunny day. The officials were worried because dangerous rays from the sun could have harmed people. The rays could have caused severe sunburns or skin cancer later in life.
The photo shows the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. UV rays can harm people and animals.
allowed the rays to reach Earth's surface. The atmosphere is made of gases, such as helium, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. One of those gases is
. Ozone forms a layer high in the atmosphere--about 10 miles above Earth.
The ozone layer blocks dangerous rays from the sun called
. Exposure to UV rays can cause health problems, such as serious sunburns and skin cancer.
During the recent alert in Punta Arenas, UV rays could have caused a serious sunburn in only 7 minutes. Scientists say that UV rays can also harm fish, small plants, and frogs' eggs.
The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year.
Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December.
This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia!
The hole was so large that, for the first time ever, the health of thousands of people who live in southern South America was threatened.
The hole in the ozone layer is mainly caused by
, say scientists. CFCs are chemicals that have been used in home and car air conditioners, as well as in spray cans. CFCs rise high into Earth's atmosphere and destroy ozone there.
In 1987, many countries agreed to limit the use of ozone-destroying chemicals. But CFCs stay in the atmosphere for decades. Even though CFCs are rarely used now, the chemical will cause problems for many years, scientists say.

734,"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime.
Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean.
Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told
. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up.""
In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon.
The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by
, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population.
that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms.
The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water.
""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told
. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth.""
Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean.
""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water.""
Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston.
How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised.
Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment.
This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:
You can conserve water by turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth.
Organize a beach or river cleanup. Beach garbage, such as plastic rings, can get tangled around sea creatures and injure or harm them.
Make sure to put trash in its proper place-not in the water or down a drain.
What does Swain mean when he refers to the river as a ""contaminated beauty""?

694,"Should handheld video games be banned from recess?
Many kids think playing handheld video games is a great way to spend their break time at school, but not all parents and school officials agree. Florence Rideout Elementary School in Wilton, New Hampshire, recently banned handheld electronic games, such as the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo Dual Screen, at recess. Other schools across the country have taken the same action. Should portable video games be allowed on the playground?
Some school officials and parents argue that portable video games defeat the purpose of recessexercise. Lisa Lewis, a parent at Florence Rideout, told the school board that students should be encouraged to ""go out and play"" and not huddle around an electronic game.
In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.
Don't toss out video games from recess, say others. A recent report from the NPD Group shows that video games are becoming more
or established, in kids' daily lives. NPD reports that 41 percent of students between the ages of 4 and 14 own portable video game systems. ""Today's kids are digital [citizens] whose activities are different [from those of] previous generations,"" says Anita Frazier of NPD.
Some people argue that electronic devices are a part of modern life, the same way jacks and marbles once were. Would schools ban those games just because they don't require exercise, they ask?
Video games are part of everyday life.

567,"The theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week is ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!""
Here's one message you never want to forget: ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which runs from October 5 through October 11.
For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:
. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

540,"Hawaii has reason to celebrate! The state welcomed its baseball champs home after they won the Little League World Series in late August.
That victory marked the first time a team from Hawaii has won a Little League world championship. Hawaii's West Oahu of Ewa Beach team defeated a team from Curaao, a country in the Caribbean, 76.
It was not an easy win. Curaao was the defending champ. The game went into extra innings. Hawaii came back from three runs down to tie the game. It was the first time a championship had gone into extra innings since 1971.
The championship game was played in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, before more than 25,000 fans. (Little League Baseball began in Pennsylvania in 1939.)
Michael Memea, 12, of Hawaii cracked the game-winning home run. ""I knew it was gone,"" he later said proudly.
After his home run, Memea rounded the bases and high-fived his teammates, who were waiting for him at home plate. Then the team took a victory jog around the stadium while fans cheered wildly. After the win, Hawaii's team manager Layton Aliviado said, ""Our dream came true!""

489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

330,"Wild Weather: Is Global Warming Causing Unusual Storms?
Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen.
For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold.
Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide.
The U.N. report blames the unusual weather on
, or a rise in temperature worldwide.
Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature.
According to the report, during the next century, global warming will cause average temperatures worldwide to increase by 2 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record.
Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide.
Some scientists, however, say global warming is mainly caused by forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events that release carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere.
Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said.
The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast.
In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions.
Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world.""

136,"Latest Finds at La Brea Tar Pits
A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt.
The bones from about 2,000 saber-toothed cats have been pulled from La Brea.
Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation.
Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91.
The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time.
Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told
. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox.""
Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit.
Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago.
During that time, Earth was cooler and was just coming out of one of many ice ages.
During ice ages, when Earth's temperature cooled, great sheets of ice, called
, formed at Earth's poles and over huge areas of land.
Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea.
After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years.""

400,"The Nobel Prizes are presented this week in Sweden and Norway.
There are prizes, and then there are really big prizes! On December 10, winners of the Nobel Prizes will receive their
Accepting the Nobel award for work in promoting peace will be Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank. It might seem strange that someone would receive a peace prize for founding a bank. But Yunus is no ordinary banker.
In 1983, Yunus founded Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, a country in Asia. The bank gives small loans to poor villagers, especially women. The Nobel Prize committee honored Yunus because ""peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty.""
In addition to celebrating progress toward peace, the Nobel committee gives awards for achievements in other areas, such as literature, physics, chemistry, and medicine. Each of the winners receives $1.4 million, a gold medal, and a diploma.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway. The other Nobel Prizes are given out in Stockholm, Sweden. Both countries are in Europe.
This year, all five of the science Nobels went to Americansthe first time that has happened since 1983. Scientist Roger Kornberg won the chemistry prize for his work on how people inherit diseases. In 1959, as a 12-year-old, Roger watched his father, Arthur Kornberg, win a Nobel Prize. The Kornbergs are the sixth father-and-son pair to have won Nobel Prizes.
Although Roger was stunned by his win, his father saw it coming. ""His work has been awesome,"" says his dad.
The Nobel Prizes were the brainchild of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (18331896) of Sweden, the inventor of dynamite. At the time of his death, Nobel left $9 million to fund the prizes that bear his name. The first annual Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901. The prizes are presented each year on December 10the anniversary of Nobels death.

54,"In the summer of 2004, Olivia Till, a student at Courtland Elementary School in Virginia, cut off a foot of her light brown hair. She donated her ponytail to Locks of Love. The Florida-based organization provides wigs to children who have lost their hair because of illness. Some children have lost their hair from cancer treatments.
Olivia, then a fourth grader, felt proud of herself for making the donation, but she wanted to do more. So she asked her principal, Sherri Steele, if she could organize a schoolwide cut-a-thon for the program.
Her principal liked the idea so much that she decided to donate her own hair as well. ""I've never had short hair in my life, so this was a personal challenge for me,"" Steele told
This past spring, a group of 29 students and teachers cut off their hair for donation to Locks of Love. Now a fifth grader, Olivia is planning to hold a second cut-athon in her school in December. She hopes her hair is long enough for another donation. What's her advice to others? ""Start something in your school or your community,"" Olivia told

339,"Some experts question rewarding reading with pizza.
Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting
But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company. ""Schools need to realize that they are undermining their students' well-being,"" says nutrition expert Jane Levine. She explains that the Book It program is a problem not just because it rewards kids with fast food but also because it makes a large company a regular part of the school day.

741,"A new video game is helping kids who need some cheering up. It is called Ben's Game. The game was named after its creator--9-year-old Ben Duskin.
four years ago. Cancer is a serious disease that can make people very sick.
For the past year, Ben has been feeling much better. When Ben was in the hospital, video games helped take his mind off being sick. That gave him the idea to help other kids who have cancer.
To make his dream come true, Ben's parents asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to help. The foundation worked with Ben to create his game. The object is to blast cancer cells.
Ben's Game is available free online. You can check it out by going to our Web site:

98,"Parts of the Great Wall of China are more than 2,000 years old.
Danny Way, 31, jumped into the record books this summer. He became the first person to leap over the Great Wall of China on a skateboard.
Parts of the Great Wall of China are more than 2,000 years old. The wall is the largest structure ever built. Experts say it is about 4,000 miles long.
Way made the jump using a ramp that he helped build near his home in California. The ramp helped him speed over the wall at nearly 50 miles an hour. That is almost as fast as a car travels on the highway!

36,"Scientists latest discovery is way too big to fit in a magicians hat!
Experts on the bunny trail recently uncovered the
of the largest known rabbit. A fossil is the remains of a plant or an animal that lived long ago. The creatures name is
The bunny weighed more than 26 pounds. Thats about six times the size of todays cottontails.
Researchers found the rabbits fossil on Minorca. That is an island that belongs to Spain. Spain is a country in Europe. The animal lived about 3 million to 5 million years ago.
The rabbit may have roamed the island, but it probably didnt hop!
had a short, stiff backbone. That would have made jumping difficult, explains scientist Josep Quintana. He helped find the fossil.
The giant discovery reminds Quintana of another wacky wabbit. He told
was similar to Bugs Bunny [because] he was so big and so different compared with other rabbits.

771,"How much weight do you carry in your backpack? In October, we asked kids to answer that question. The good news is this: Most of you are not overloaded. The average backpack weighed 7 pounds. But some weighed more than 15 pounds! Ouch!

476,"There was a time when all a backpack was used for was to carry school books and papers. But today, backpacks are being weighed down by many things, such as laptop computers, sneakers, CDs, and video games.

72,"Tough Talkin'!: Discussing Bullies and Other Problems
It's not easy being a kid. That's what a recent national survey of kids and parents revealed. Bullying and violence at school are just some of the problems facing many kids today. How can kids cope with such tough issues?
""Tough issues are facing kids at younger ages,"" said Tina Hoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The group is a children's health organization. The foundation, Children Now (a children's research group), and Nickelodeon asked children ages 8 to 15 and parents to point out the tough issues kids deal with every day.
The survey, called Talking With Kids About Tough Issues, found that
about seven out of ten kids say bullying and teasing are problems at their school.
about four out of ten kids say kids at their school face threats of violence.
about seven out of ten kids in the survey say they are too embarrassed about their problems to talk to parents.
Other issues children say are problems at school include smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using drugs.
The survey found that when parents talk early about tough issues, kids learn to trust them more. Those kids who learn to talk to parents learn how to deal with problems that bother them.

99,"Aibo is a robot. It is a dog that can bark and wag its tail!
Imagine it is the year 2014. After dinner, your robot clears the table and loads the dishwasher. Another robot tells jokes to make you laugh.
Does that sound like a scene out of a movie? It's not! Scientists predict robots will be very common in homes across the country in the near future.
Many robots are already being sold today. Sony's QRIO and iRobot's Roomba are two of these robots. QRIO is a humanlike robot that can talk, walk, jump, and dance. Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner.

39,"What do you get when you cross Mickey Mouse with Dumbo? A long-eared jerboa! The little critter is from Mongolia and China. Those are countries in Asia. The animal is not actually a mouse. It is a rodent with long legs and giant ears.
, or at risk of dying out completely. Scientists recently filmed video of the animals for the first time. ""The big ears make them look cute and comical,"" scientist Jonathan Baillie told
Baillie is with the Zoological Society of London's EDGE of Existence program. The program works to
, or save, endangered animals. A team will study jerboas in an effort to save them.
""It is important to conserve the long-eared jerboa,"" Baillie says. ""If we lost [the animals] there would be nothing similar on the planet.""

675,"Scientists are purring over the latest panther news. The cats are slowly making a comeback.
or very, endangered species. Fifteen years ago, only about 25 of the adult cats were left in the wild. Today, there are more than 100.
Scientists helped the panthers by starting a special breeding program. They moved eight cougars to Florida. Cougars and panthers are both types of mountain lions.
The panthers and cougars had healthy babies together. In fact, todays Florida panthers are bigger and stronger than their grandparents.
The baby boom doesnt mean the panthers are in the clear, though. A population of 100 is still not [workable] in the long term, says scientist David Onorato. [This] is a project thats going to have to be done again.

683,"What is a three-letter word for trouble? Flu! That is short for
(in-floo-EN-zah). The flu is caused by a virus that can be passed easily from person to person. People who catch the virus often have fevers, sore muscles, and coughs.
Doctors say the best way to keep from getting the virus is to get a flu shot. However, this year there weren't enough flu shots for everyone. Health experts found that one company's flu shots weren't safe. That company was supposed to supply the United States with half of the 100 million doses needed.
This year, there were not enough flu shots for everyone. The people at highest risk received a flu shot first.
Hang in there! The flu strikes the United States for only part of the year. Flu season usually runs from November to March.
Despite the short supply of flu shots, there are ways to stay flu-free. To keep the virus away, practice healthful habits.
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs can easily enter your body there.

225,"Everyone onboard the boat waited patiently. Suddenly, one person broke the silence. ""Manatee! Nobody move a muscle,"" whispered scientist Caryn Self Sullivan.
Looking into the shallow water, we spotted a baby manatee. To our surprise, the young manatee was alone. ""I've never seen one this small on its own!"" said Sullivan. We wondered,
That is exactly the kind of question we hoped to answer.
Along with other volunteers, I was helping scientists study manatees off the coast of Belize (beh-LEEZ). Belize is a country in Central America. We observed manatees and their
, an area where an animal lives. We were trying to find out how manatees spend their time.
Manatees are large marine mammals with wrinkled, grayish brown skin. They can grow to 13 feet long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds.
Scientists think that many manatees are living in the warm waters off the coast of Belize. Manatees have been protected by Belize law for about 70 years.
, or plant eaters. They eat more than 100 pounds of plants each day. That is about the same as 200 heads of lettuce!
Many people think manatees look like walruses, but they are actually related to elephants.
Manatees are very curious. They often swim up to boats or snorkelers to check them out.
, or in danger of dying out. Sometimes they are hunted for food. Many are killed when they get tangled in fishing gear or are hit by boats.
Sullivan's team is trying to find better ways of protecting manatees. I hope that with help from volunteers like me, Sullivan will be able to help these gentle giants survive.

221,"Your used wrappers and empty boxes could be more than just garbage. The items could help people in need. Inventor Max Wallack can prove it.
The 12-year-old student from Massachusetts recently invented the Home Dome. It is a small
, or building. It is made of garbage such as plastic, wire, and packing peanuts. The structure could provide shelter for homeless people.
Maxs invention helped him win the grand prize in the Trash to Treasure contest. That is a nationwide contest for kids. It is organized by the PBS television program
As part of his prize, the inventor met some designers. Together, they built a
of the Home Dome. A prototype is a model.
Max has wanted to help homeless people since he was a little kid. He hopes they can use his creation. I always thought of ways to help the [homeless], he told

Martin Luther King, Jr., at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On January 16, Americans will honor a great leaderMartin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968). This year is the 20th anniversary of the King holiday.

10,"Railroad tracks connecting Seoul and Pyongyang should be completed in September 2001. Seoul is South Korea's capital. Pyongyang is North Korea's capital.
North Korea and South Korea are two countries in Asia. They have been officially at war for 47 years. Now, however, the countries seem to be making tracks toward peace.
South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.

187,"Great geysers of water! Thats what scientists recently discovered on Enceladus (en-SEL-ahduhss), one of Saturns moons.
is a spring that shoots water into the air.
An illustration of a geyser on Saturn's moon Enceladus.
Scientists are excited by the news. Water is a key ingredient for life. Life may exist in water beneath the icy surface of Enceladus, say scientists. However, dont expect to hear about the discovery of little green aliens. The forms of life most likely to be found are
A microbe is a simple life-form that can be seen only under a microscope.
The findings are based on images from the spacecraft
which has been studying Saturn and its moons since 2004. The images show geysers shooting water hundreds of miles above the surface of Enceladus.
For now, scientists will have to be patient.

387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

205,"Nine-year-old Steven Vance of Michigan is a hero. He recently saved his mothers life.
His mother was eating a piece of chicken while walking around the kitchen. Suddenly, she began to choke on her food. She thought, ""What should I do?""
Luckily, Steven knew exactly what to do. He jumped up and rushed to his mother. Steven stood behind her and put his hands over her stomach. Then he pressed in and up, forcing out the piece of chicken.
. That is a special move that can save the life of someone who is choking.
How did Steven know what to do? He had read about the lifesaving move in Weekly Reader last year. ""Its amazing that he learned it from reading a diagram,"" said Stevens mother. ""That information really helped me out.""
1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
2. Make a fist and hold it against the persons stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.

523,"The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students reading lessons.
, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. He responds in so many ways, teacher Judy Quigley told
Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they dont worry about making mistakes. When you read to people, sometimes they dont really listen, but he always listens, Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told
Students keep Starbucks attention by changing their reading styles during stories. I say it kind of louder so he can hear it, explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesnt work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!

289,"Some students in Pennsylvania recently made a hair-raising find. The kids at Landisville Intermediate Center discovered a
hair. Mastodons were furry, elephant-like animals. The creatures lived until about 10,000 years ago.
The students uncovered the hair while working on the Mastodon Matrix Project. That project allows volunteers to study material from sites where the remains of mastodons were found.
The class used paintbrushes to comb through the dirt. It felt like I was a scientist, Katie Minnich told
Students (above) found a hair that belonged to a mastodon.
Buried within the soil was the 8-inch-long hair. Each student studied the strand using a magnifying glass. They knew it did not come from a human, a dog, or a cat. It felt like a wire, explains Cameron Aksu.
The students were amazed at their brush with history. It was really cool, says Allee Glinsky. We knew [the hair was] a part of something really old.

591,"Look, Mano hands! A van recently traveled from Europe to Asia without a driver. It used
to get around. Sensors are instruments that can notice heat, light, and sound. The vehicle also used electricity instead of gas.
The driverless van takes a passenger for a spin.
The van journeyed 8,077 miles. It made the trip in three months. Two scientists stayed in the van in case anything went wrong. One time, they had to take control when the vehicle was stopped by a police officer. The officer almost gave the experts a ticket because there was no driver! Once they explained that the drive was an experiment, he let them go.
We are happy we made it to the finishing line without any real problems, says Alberto Broggi. He works for the company that created the van. The company hopes that one day, robotic cars will make driving safer. Now if only they could make a robot to clean your room!

Kaitlyn Rentala: Why did you want to direct
I love the character. ... Hes the coolest. Hes the most fun. Hes got this huge heart, but hes also a bit of a troublemaker. I always liked that about him.
KR: How do you decide which actors voices to use?
It can be [hard]. ... We know what the character should look like, so we take a picture of it and we put it on a TV screen. Then we play different actors voices ... and imagine the voice coming out of that character.
KR: What do you hope kids take away from the new movie?

(ty-ta-noh-BOH-uh sai-rah-HOH-nen-siss). It weighed 2,500 pounds and measured about 42 feet long. Its
, or huge, body was at least 3 feet wide.
This thing ... [was] longer than a city bus, says Jack Conrad, a snake expert.

snakes. The fossils include backbones and ribs. The scientists plan to return to Colombia to look for more bones.
Experts also hope to learn whatand how much

It could easily eat something the size of a cow, Conrad explains. A human would just be toast.

80,"Scientists go to great lengths to copy the world's tallest trees.
Tree climbers at Roy's Redwoods Open Space Preserve in California have a huge job! They are climbing redwoods more than 200 feet tall to snip cuttings from the trees' highest branches. Some
, or tree experts, say those cuttings may help
Redwoods are some of the tallest trees in the world. They can grow more than 300 feet tall and live for more than 2,000 years. However, many redwood forests have been cut down. Only 5 percent of forests with the oldest redwood trees are left.
David Milarch of Champion Tree Project International wants to change that. He has launched a campaign to
redwoods so new forests can be planted. To clone is to copy
. Genetic material is information inside living creatures. It determines features, such as size and height.
Milarch and his team want to clone the oldest, tallest redwoods. So far, the team has collected 900 cuttings from three redwoods in California. Arborists put them in a special nursery to grow. After a few years, the cuttings will be ready for planting.
Some of those young trees will stay in California, but Milarch also wants to send the cloned trees all over the world. ""[The forests] can be a model for the world,"" he told
. ""We've made terrible mistakes by cutting down forests ... and we're going to go back and try to fix it.""
Trees don't have diaries, but they do keep good records. Each ring in a tree's trunk represents a year of growth. The more rain that fell during the year, the wider the ring is.

708,"A newborn giant panda has been in the spotlight lately. Thousands of people are watching the cub on a Web camera at the National Zoo. The zoo is in Washington, D.C.
The panda was born there in July. The zoo's indoor panda exhibit has been closed so that the baby and its mother can spend time together. ""Everyone is in love with this panda cub,"" zoo spokesperson Sarah Taylor told
The zoo's giant pandas are on loan from China. China is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild. They are
or in danger of dying out. Today, only about 1,600 giant pandas live in China.
""We are very excited,"" says Taylor. ""It's great to have another one of these animals in the world.""

434,"This winter festival is both freezing and fun.
Welcome to the city of ice! Beginning January 5, the city of Harbin in northeastern China
or changes, into a winter wonderland. The ice festival is a popular tourist attraction. It has been drawing crowds for 33 years. Organizers expect millions of visitors to pour into the citys parks this year. There, they will see hundreds of snow sculptures and some huge buildings made with bricks of ice.
Harbin is the coldest city in China. The temperature in the city is below freezing for more than six months of the year. (The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.) In Harbin, the temperature can fall below zero. That gives people there a great
or chance, to build with tons of snow and ice. In fact, they use enough snow and ice to fill 90 large swimming pools!
In December, 3,000 workers began creating the winter amusement park. They carved giant castles, friendly dragons, slippery slides, and even working restaurants out of ice. Some of the buildings and sculptures have colorful lights that are lit up at night.
Many of the ice sculptures are made by teams of artists from around the world. When visitors come to look at the creations, they have to watch their step. Not only are the buildings made of ice, but so are many of the walkways and railings!
The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past.
What kind of sculpture or building would you like to see built out of ice? Why?

504,"You are playing outside when it begins to rain. The rain gets heavier. You run for cover. Thunder roars overhead. Giant streaks of lightning flash across the sky.
When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say.
Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun!
When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car.
While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year.
Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors.
Whether you are outdoors or indoors during a thunderstorm, it is important to stay safe.
Try to find shelter in a car or building.
Avoid water, high places, and open spaces.
Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines.
Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes.

13,"Allergies are on the rise in the United States.
! Youve probably been hearing those sounds a lot. Why?
are increasing in the United States. Those are bad reactions to things around you or that you eat.
More than half of Americans are now sensitive to at least one
Thats the finding of one of the most recent surveys by the National Institutes of Health. Allergens are things that set off allergies. Many allergenssuch as dust and moldare found in the air.
Allergies [are] increasing over time, says Andy Nish. He is a doctor from Georgia.
Allergens in the air arent the only problem. Kids food allergies have risen too. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of kids with food allergies jumped 18 percent. Eating milk products and eggs can give some children rashes. Those foods can even cause some people to have trouble breathing.
Whats behind allergies spread? Some scientists think our
dont have enough to do. Immune systems help our bodies fight germs. But kids today come in contact with fewer germs than their grandparents did. Thats in part because more medicine is available. Experts say that when our immune systems have fewer germs to fight, they can get confused. They attack other things, such as milk, instead.
Other scientists say hotter temperatures are to blame. They say the weather is warmer for longer periods now, so plants bloom longer. Plants release pollen (left), which is a common allergen.
Doctors do not know for sure whats making allergies increase. But they do know how to treat them with medicine. There is very good treatment for allergies, Nish says. No one should suffer with symptoms.
Dust and other allergens that float into your nose are in for a blasta cough or a sneeze, that is! Both are natural
, or responses, to help keep you from getting sick. Heres a look at the big bursts.
Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.
What might be some other reasons for the rise in allergies?

430,"Music and dancing are often part of Hispanic festivals.
The face of the United States is changing. Hispanic Americans, also known as Latinos, make up the fastest-growing group. The latest U.S.
update shows that 41 million people are Hispanic. A census is a count of people.
Hispanic Americans are people whose families are from Spanish-speaking countries. Most of those countries are in Central and South America.
Nearly 297 million people live in the United States today. One of every seven people in our country is Hispanic!
The news comes just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month. It takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. During this time, Americans honor Hispanic history and customs. Many families celebrate by taking part in festivals and parades.

569,"Wiffle ball has become a favorite backyard game through the years. This year, the famous plastic ball turns 50!
The Wiffle ball was invented in 1953. A few years later, the yellow plastic bat became part of the game.
A Connecticut man got the idea for the Wiffle ball after watching his son play ball with a friend. ""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" said his son.
The Wiffle ball is hollow and has eight holes on one side. In the air, the ball dips and curves. That makes it hard for a batter to hit.
How did the ball get its name? When a kid swung at a ball and missed, kids used to say he or she had whiffed, said the inventor's grandson.

199,"Scientists have been studying how much the ground beneath Machu Picchu has been sliding. In January, some Japanese scientists warned that if the ground continued to slide, a big landslide might destroy Machu Picchu.
Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area.
The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official.
The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon.
The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes.
The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year.

503,"Do you spend a lot of time watching television or surfing the Internet? While you may be having fun, you may also be missing out on something else-staying fit!
The American Heart Association (AHA) recently reported that many U.S. kids are not getting enough exercise. The AHA recommends kids get at least 30 minutes of exercise three to four times each week.
The AHA report says that about 15 out of every 100 kids ages 6 to 11 are overweight. Being overweight can lead to health problems like heart disease and diabetes later in life.
To help kids stay fit and have fun, some schools are adding a new twist to gym class. In some elementary schools, students are really climbing the walls-indoor rock-climbing walls! Other schools are offering activities such as dancing, in-line skating, and kite flying.
Teachers want kids to develop good fitness habits that will last a lifetime. ""We're hoping that students find activities that they enjoy doing and that they'll continue doing for the rest of their lives,"" said gym teacher Reid Chase.

141,"Scientists in Canada are playing Go Fish. They recently counted sharks that swim in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada.
Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to
or watch, the sharks in the coming months.

78,"Inauguration Day is filled with events from morning to night. Some are serious, and others are just plain fun! Here are some of the day's top events.
George W. Bush taking the Oath of Office on January 20, 2001, after his first election.
George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath.
In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant?
In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there.
An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!
George Washington's inaugural address in 1793 was the shortest. His speech lasted only eight minutes. In 1841, William Henry Harrison gave the longest inaugural address. It lasted almost two hours!
Cold weather caused quite a problem at the inaugural ball for Ulysses S. Grant in 1873. The ball was held in a tent, which wasn't heated, and the valves on the band's musical instruments froze!

155,"February is the month in which millions of Americans celebrate African American history. Many important events in African American history took place in February.
For example, Rosa Parks was born during this month. In 1955, Parks was arrested when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. In some places at that time, it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus.
of, or refusal to use, the bus company. Many blacks refused to ride the city buses for more than a year, until those unfair laws were changed.
In 1926, the historian Carter G. Woodson declared a week honoring black history. He chose the February week with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.

58,"Imagine diving into a world filled with giant starfish and yellow sea lilies. That is what scientists from New Zealand recently did. New Zealand is an island country near Australia.
Scientists spent five weeks studying sea life in the Ross Sea. That is a body of water near Antarctica. Antarctica is the southernmost place on Earth.
The team used special cameras to see all the way down to the seafloor. They collected more than 30,000
, or samples. They found eight types of fish that may be new to scientists.
, or sea, creatures the scientists found are bigger than similar creatures in other parts of the world. The starfish, for example, are 2 feet wide. Some starfish in other seas are less than 1 inch wide.

566,"Asian swamp eels are no ordinary eels. They are fierce hunters. They can live on land and in the water. Now scientists are worried that the eels may take control of Everglades National Park in Florida.
The eels came from Vietnam, a country in Asia. Scientists believe someone accidentally released some of the eels in waters near the park. The eels feed on the plants and animals that many Everglades animals eat to survive. Scientists hope to catch the eels before they reach the park's waters.

737,"How good are you at keeping a secret? Waldo Wilcox, 74, of Utah, kept one for more than 50 years! Until recently, people didn't know about the ancient Native American village on his land. ""I wanted to keep it the way it is,"" said Wilcox.
Since Wilcox is no longer able to care for the land, he decided it was a good time to share his secret. The state of Utah now owns the land. Officials plan to make it open to the public.
Experts say the village once belonged to the Fremont people. They lived in central and northern Utah more than 1,000 years ago.
at the site. Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. Some of the finds include arrowheads, beads, and pieces of pottery. Scientists hope the artifacts will teach them more about Fremont culture.

19,"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses
vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.)
The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message.

784,"? It may sound like a tongue twister, but it is actually a new species of dinosaur. Scientists recently finished a
were discovered in 1998 in South America. Fossils are ancient remains of plants or animals. Scientists spent almost six years cleaning the bones and putting them together. After studying the fossils, scientists learned that the dinosaur lived about 225 million years ago. It was one of the first two-legged plant-eating dinosaurs on Earth!
Scientists say the new species is related to dinosaurs that lived in what is now Europe. The discovery supports the idea of a supercontinent called

166,"Did you know that the sun can power a car? Students from Canada set a world record last summer with a car powered by the sun. The students drove 4,350 miles in the solar-powered car. It is the longest distance a solar car has ever traveled.
Because the car uses the sun for power, it does not pollute the air. Special cells are on top of the car. The cells collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. The electricity powers the car's motor.
Each day, the car used the same amount of electricity needed to run a toaster. The team hopes that someday more people will drive solar cars.

187,"The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A
has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life.
People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow.
Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.
Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?

They are active at night. They sleep during the day.
Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find
in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food.
Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals.

Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects.
Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.
How might being nocturnal help animals survive?

40,"Experts say that Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. They say that some of the coldest temperatures in the world have been noted in Antarctica. People there wear special clothes to stay warm. But how do animals stay warm in Antarctica?
Antarctica is a big icy continent. It is around the South Pole. The South Pole is found at the bottom of Earth.
Penguins are birds. Emperor and Adelie penguins live in Antarctica. The penguins stay warm because they have feathers that are very small and close together. The feathers have oil on them. Cold water can't get through the feathers to touch the penguins' skin. Each year, penguins molt, or lose, their feathers and grow new ones.
Penguins can waddle faster than humans can walk.
Penguins like to line up and dive into the water again and again.
Penguins sometimes toboggan, or slide, on their bellies.
Penguins surf waves to get back to shore.
Weddell seals live in Antarctica. Weddell seals swim in the cold ocean water to catch fish and other ocean animals to eat. These seals don't chew their food. They swallow the food in big pieces.
Weddell seals stay warm because they have a layer of blubber, or fat. They also have a coat of thick fur. The fur keeps water from touching the seal's skin.

625,"Honeybees are really busy. Using flowers, bees begin to make honey. They visit between 50 and 100 flowers in one trip from the beehive. Follow the buzz to the beehive inside, and discover how honey is made.
Follow the steps honey takes from a flower to a grocery store shelf.
     Honeybees need flowers to make honey. Honeybees collect
from the flower. Nectar is a sweet liquid used to make honey.
     Honeybees live and make honey in hives. Bees bring the gathered nectar back to the hive.
     In the hive, bees place the nectar in a group of cells called a
That is wax bees make from their bodies.
     The worker bees fan the liquid nectar with their wings. That turns the nectar into thick and sticky honey. The honeycombs become bigger as more nectar is brought and honey is made.
     Beekeepers collect honey inside the beehive. The honey sold in grocery stores was collected by a beekeeper.
A beehive is ruled by one queen bee.
The brain of a worker honeybee is about the size of the head of a pin.
A honeybee would have to visit 2 million flowers to make only 1 pound of honey.
During its lifetime, a honeybee makes enough honey to equal the size of a pea.
Honeybees flap their wings more than 11,000 times each minute. That makes a buzzing sound.

432,"How does food get from the farm to you?
time! A harvest is the gathering of food. Many fruits and vegetables are
in the fall. They are fully grown. They are ready to be picked and eaten.
Miller Farms is busy with its fall harvest. The farm is in Platteville, Colorado. It grows many vegetables. Carrots, beets, and onions are just a few of them. David Patterson works on the farm. He told
Kids can visit the farm and pick their own vegetables.
 We pick the vegetables by hand each day. Carrots are kind of tough to pick. You have to loosen them with a shovel first.
 We bring the food in from the field with trucks. We put the food into crates.
 The crates get loaded onto a truck. We take the food to farmers markets to sell it. Its all fresh and good.
Why might fruits and vegetables need to be picked when they are ripe?

475,"Fourteen chubby hedgehogs in Scotland were recently put on a diet. Workers at a wildlife center had rescued the animals during a bad winter last year. The hedgehogs ate a lot of food at the center.
What happens when hedgehogs get too fat? They cannot roll into a ball to protect themselves.
When a hedgehog rolls into a ball, its spines stick out in all directions. That keeps
away. A predator is an animal that eats another animal.
The hedgehogs lost weight. They were returned to the wild. Now they can curl up into balls again. That will help them stay safe.

462,"The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A
has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life.
People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow.
Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.
Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?

163,"What lives in the oceans? Scientists are trying to find out. They recently finished a 10-year study. It is called the Census of Marine Life. A
More than 2,000 scientists worked on the census. They explored all parts of the oceans. They discovered many new kinds of animals. Most of those animals live in the deepest parts of the oceans. Those areas had not been explored much until now.
The census is just the beginning. The ocean is simply so vast that, after 10 years of hard work, we still have only snapshots, though sometimes detailed, of what the sea contains. But it is an important and impressive start, says Nancy Knowlton. She is a scientist who worked on the census.

82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!

467,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

555,"How do bees and other insects fly so well? Scientists in England may have found the answer. Their research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft.
The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and
(able to bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.
""Our work will make the goal of tiny aircraft, perhaps eventually the size of bees, a step closer,"" says one of the scientists.
The aircraft would have tiny cameras attached to them. In the future, these machines may be used for keeping an eye on traffic or even for spying.

114,"What do birds and people have in common? Dreaming, scientists say. People often dream of events that happened during the day. Scientists say birds dream about singing.
Scientists attached a special device to the head of a bird called the zebra finch. Scientists watched how the bird's brain acted while it was singing. Then they watched how the bird's brain behaved while it slept. The bird's brain acted the same way!

386,"In Harlem, a section of New York City, playing hockey and doing well in school go hand in hand.
A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink.
To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores.

220,"September 17 is the start of Constitution Week. Many events will take place across the country. One event is called America Reads the Constitution.
Kids and adults will hear people read the Constitution at the National Constitution Center. That is a museum in Philadelphia. It is across the street from where the Constitution was signed.

342,"Many animals hide in a special way called
Some animals, like chameleons, have skin color that can change. Those animals change their skin color to hide from their enemies. The animal's skin color changes to blend into its setting, such as a tree's bark.
Some animals, like gecko lizards, have colors that match their settings. Those animals use matching color to hide from their enemies. The animal's color matches its setting, such as snow or rock.
Some animals, like katydids, have special body shapes. Their bodies can look like leaves or sticks. The animal's body shape helps it hide from its enemies.
Why might some animals use more than one kind of camouflage?
Some animals, like tigers, have special patterns in their fur that match their settings. The special pattern helps the animal hide from its enemies. The patterns can look like grass. Can you find both tigers in the tall grass?

495,"Tropical rain forests are in danger of disappearing, but children are working hard to protect them. They are raising money by holding bake sales, collecting pennies, and even selling T-shirts! That money will help save rain forest land and the animals that live there.
Experts worry about rain forests but say that people can save them.
For many years people have been cutting down too many trees for wood and clearing too much land for farming.

83,"Deitte (DEE-et) Curry's dog was having trouble breathing. Doctors said the 12-year-old dog was sick. The dog had a weak heart and needed an operation. Doctors put a
in the dog's heart. A pacemaker is a small device that helps the heart beat evenly.
The dog's pacemaker came from a woman who had died. She wanted her pacemaker to help an animal. A pacemaker cannot be used again in a person, but a pacemaker can be used again in an animal.

492,"A new study shows that hibernating animals are less likely to die out. Why? Earths weather has been changing over time. Scientists say animals that sleep or hide are able to
the changes better. To survive is to stay alive.
Animals that sleep or hide are protected from nature, says scientist Bill Toone. That helps them survive.
A chipmunk hibernates during the cold days of winter.

501,"Many people like to munch on sweet, juicy apples. In fact, most Americans eat about 65 apples each year. Apples are grown on farms called
. An orchard has rows and rows of apple trees. The trees change during each of the four seasons of the year.
During winter, apple trees rest. By winter, they have lost their leaves. Their branches are
in the fall. That means they are fully grown. The apples are ready to be picked and eaten.
In the spring, apple trees begin to
, or grow flowers. When the flowers fall off, small apples begin to grow.
In the summer, the new apples are green. They keep growing all season.

620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.

512,"Hi, my name is Hannah. Meet my dad, Paul. He is a firefighter in Connecticut. We spent a day together at his firehouse.
My dad taught me that there are many important parts of a firefighter's job. Look at some things firefighters do every day.
If a fire happens, firefighters hurry to get onto the fire
An engine is a fire truck. Engines have ladders, hoses, and other tools to fight fires.
Firefighters teach people. All families should have a
. A fire escape plan shows two ways out of every room. Families should have an outside meeting place, away from danger.
Firefighters have to practice so they know what to do during a real fire. Here, my dad climbs a ladder. That helps him get used to wearing his heavy gear and tools without falling.
After a fire, firefighters take care of the engines and their gear. Firefighters put their gear away neatly so they can get dressed quickly for the next emergency.
Paul shares these important fire safety rules.
Remind a grown-up to test smoke alarms once a month.
Be sure you know and practice your family's fire escape plan.
Decide where to meet outside in case of a fire.
Know two ways out of every room.
When fire strikes, be sure to get out and stay out!
