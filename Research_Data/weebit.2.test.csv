5070,"To read a map you need to understand compass directions, grid references and the map's key and scale. You need to be able to find features when given a map reference. You also need to be able to describe a feature's location on a map by giving a map reference. From a map you should be able to pick out key information on natural features and types of human activity (eg, is this an rural or urban location?)
Maps are representations of the world. Maps are written by people called
the world. Maps contain information tailored to a specific purpose.
, for example, contains information that helps the reader get from one place to another using a vehicle.
will contain information of less interest to a road user, such as how the land in a place is used, the population density and the political boundaries that exist between regions, states and nations.
There are five fundamental things you need to be familiar with to read a map successfully:
Compass directions are vital for finding your way around a map. There are many ways to remember where each direction goes. You probably learnt a rhyme or a phrase to help you remember - if not, here's one now. Starting at the top and moving clockwise the directions on a compass or map are:

maps are divided into numbered squares. These squares can be used to give a place a four or six-figure grid reference. It is important that you know both
Easting are lines that run up and down the map. They increase in number the further you move east (or right). You can use them to measure how far to travel east.
Northings are lines that run across the map horizontally. They increase in number the further you move north (or up the map). You can use them to measure how far to travel north.
numbers along the bottom of the map come first and the numbers up the side of the map come second

Just like a key to a door, the key on a map helps you to unlock the information stored in the colours and symbols on a map. You must understand how the key relates to the map before you can unlock the information it contains. The key will help you to identify types of boundaries, roads, buildings, agriculture, industry, places of interest and geographical features.

Make sure you read the title of a map before you start to use it. This will give you a general idea about the information it stores. While it may appear a straight-forward thing to do, under exam conditions, it is easy to confuse different maps or not use the one that is most useful.
The scale of a map allows a reader to calculate the size, height and dimensions of the features shown on the map, as well as distances between different points. The scale on a map is the ratio between real life sizes and how many times it has been shrunk to fit it on the map.
The scale below is for a 1:50,000 scale map. At this scale, 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm on the ground (= 500 metres or 0.5 kilometres).
maps, the most common type of map in the UK, come in several scales.
Travel maps have a scale of 1:125,000. This means 1cm on the map represents 125,000 in the real world or 1 cm = 1.25km. These are used by drivers going long distances.
Landranger maps are 1:50,000 (1cm = 500m). These are useful for drivers going shorter distances.
Explorer maps are 1:25,000 (1cm = 250m). These are useful for walking and other outdoor pursuits.
Landplan maps are 1:10,000 (1cm = 100m). These show individual streets clearly and might be used by town planners.
You will be asked to interpret maps to find out specific information. Being able to distinguish between different types of land use on an Ordnance Survey (OS) map will help you interpret maps during your exams. Here are some things you should brush up on:
Make sure you can tell the difference between urban and rural land use. Start by looking at the key. Are the features in the key related to the countryside or to towns?
Look out for features of the urban landscape that are represented in symbols on the OS map. Start by looking at modes of transport (eg junctions of main roads, railways, ports and airports).
Look for rural features. Study the key carefully to see what different areas of shading on the map represent. For example, different types of farmland will be shaded differently.
Study the relief of the land on your OS map by looking for the
lines on a map joining points of equal height above sea level - thus representing the slope of the land
. Contours will show you where the hills (elevations) and valleys (depressions) are on the map. Contours will often show changes in height of 5 or 10 meters. The closer the contours are together the steeper the slope is. If the contours are far apart, you might be looking at a flat flood plain. On the map below the contours in square
are quite close together - indicating a fairly steep
Make sure that you know how to interpret different types of map. Read keys and grid references carefully.
When drawing maps be sure to include the following:
- stating what the map shows (eg land use or vegetation cover)
- so the reader knows what the symbols on the map represent
- showing which way is up (North)
- so the reader can translate distances shown on the map into distances on the ground
: In the case of map skills the internet is
. The best way to practise map skills is to use real OS maps. If possible look at a number of different types of map - this will help you identify urban and rural landscapes, different human activities and human influences on the landscape. It will also help you to spot the different natural and physical geographical processes that have taken place - the processes that you learnt about in the sections on rivers, coasts and glaciation.

7598,"A wig-maker who developed the water frame, although he seems to have stolen the idea from a spinner called Lewis Paul. It was too big and heavy to be used in people's homes. He moved to Nottingham to get away from the Luddism in Lancashire, went into partnership with Jedediah Strutt, and
set up a horse-powered factory in Nottingham
. At first, Arkwright sold thread to the Nottingham stocking-makers.
Strutt lent him the money to build Cromford Mill which was water-powered.
Arkwright pioneered the systems of factory rules
, discipline and time-keeping, and built the village of Cromford to house his workers.
When the duty on cotton cloth was abolished,
. He built more factories and expanded his business
Luddites burned down his factory at Chorley in Lancashire.
Arkwright sued anyone who used his idea, but
he lost his patent when it was proved that he did not invent the water frame
. This allowed anyone to use the water frame.
Arkwright first used a Watt steam engine to power his machinery.
He died a very wealthy man worth half a million pounds.

Remember that when you make a point, you need to support it with a quotation and then explain exactly how the quotation highlights what you want to show.
At the start of the novel, we are told:
""Ralph and Jack smiled at each other with shy liking""
Yet by the end, they are mortal enemies. What happens to ruin their friendship?
Introduction - Discuss the quotation in the title. It occurs just after the first vote for chief in Chapter 1. What does it show about them?
Paragraph 1 - Look at Chapter 3, when Ralph builds huts while Jack hunts for pigs. What does it show about Ralph and Jack's priorities? Are they still together?
Paragraph 2 - Discuss what happens in Chapter 4 when Jack lets the fire go out when he goes hunting and a ship sails by. What impact does this have on the friendship?
Paragraph 3 - Examine how Jack undermines Ralph's authority more and more, such as when he rejects the law of the conch and other rules on the assembly in Chapter 5.
Paragraph 4 - Comment on Chapter 9, when Jack sets up his own tribe and Simon is killed in the 'dance'. What has happened to Ralph and Jack's relationship now?
Conclusion - By the end, Jack is in control of the fort and of all the boys. He wants Ralph dead. What does this show about the differences between the former friends?

5617,"Any large-scale economic activity may have a negative impact on the natural environment. Manufacturing industries in particular can cause air, water and noise
The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.

2813,"In your German exam you will have to show your reading skills. This exercise will help you understand an article where some students describe where they live.
Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.

War transforms soldiers, breaking them physically and mentally: 'Bent double' 'Knock-kneed'. Rather than glorious men, Owen presents the soldiers as weakened old 'hags'.
The experience of war is something no soldier can escape: 'In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, / He plunges at me'.
The effect of gas used in World War One is communicated to the reader through Owen's use of verbs linked to death by a lack of oxygen: 'guttering, choking, drowning', 'smothering'.
Owen offers the reader very graphic imagery associated with suffering, aiming to present the truth about the war experience, arguably arising from his first-hand experience of war.
Owen presents the soldiers as victims who have been betrayed by those who encouraged them to go to war. He uses words such as 'innocent' and 'children' to reinforce his positive attitude to the soldiers.
Owen is bitter about war and the encouragement given to go to war. He angrily refers to 'The old Lie' that dying for your country is sweet and honourable.
The detailed description of a soldier dying as a result of gas attack is intended to make the reader feel discomfort, forcing him or her to confront the reality of war, something which is far from honourable or sweet.

6329,"Account for the emergence of NICRA in 1967?
Teacher's notes: This question is worth 6 marks in the exam. Give yourself 7 - 8 minutes to answer it.
Mark Scheme: In History you are marked by levels. The higher the level the more marks you get and so the higher grade you will achieve.
The answer will provide few reasons for the emergence of NICRA with no real explanations offered.
The answer will provide more reasons with some explanations offered.
The answer will provide a number of reasons with detailed explanations.
NICRA was set up because of events in the USA where Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a similar campaign in America in the 1960s. At the same time discrimination in Northern Ireland was still continuing. NICRA campaigned for ""One Man, One Vote"".
John would get a level 1 for this answer. The candidate only touches on the influence of the USA and events in Northern Ireland. The candidate does not develop the two points to answer the question fully and directly.
NICRA emerged due to a number of events and influences. A major factor in its emergence was the impact of the 1947 Education Act. This made Catholics more confident in the 1960s to demand civil rights. A further influence was the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice in 1964. This organisation highlighted the forms of discrimination that existed in Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s. This helped bring about the establishment of NICRA in 1967.
A final factor to explain the emergence of NICRA was Labour's victory in the 1964 General Election.
Paul would get a level 2 for this answer. The candidate makes two valid points in the first paragraph. However other important factors are omitted and he does not explain the last point in the second paragraph.
The emergence of NICRA can be explained by a number of events, both within Northern Ireland and outside of Northern Ireland. The 1947 Education Act helped to create a larger professional and educated Catholic class in Northern Ireland. It was more assertive and confident in demanding civil rights for all by the mid 1960s.
Also within Northern Ireland there was the Campaign for Social Justice that was set up in 1964. This organisation acted as a forerunner for the emergence of NICRA in 1967.
Furthermore within Northern Ireland by the mid 1960s, members of a number of political parties, as well as labour and republican groups were working to establish a civil rights movement. They felt that O'Neill's government had done little to address grievances in voting, housing, policing and employment.
Outside of Northern Ireland there were other influences. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of a civil rights movement in the USA. It was having some success and this inspired a similar movement in Northern Ireland.
Also in 1964 a Labour government was elected in Britain. Labour was seen as being more sympathetic to the nationalist cause. This may have raised the expectations of Catholics into believing that a protest group campaigning for civil rights might succeed. A year later over 100 MPs in Britain formed the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster. This further raised the expectations of Catholics and influenced the establishment of NICRA.
Michael would get a level 3 for this answer. This response is very direct and extremely comprehensive. The candidate is aware of all the important factors that account for the emergence of NICRA.

, since poems communicate their meaning in a number of different ways - not just the everyday meaning of the words.
Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
'I rise in the dawn, and I kneel and blow
Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;
And then I must scrub and bake and sweep
Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;
And the young lie long and dream in their bed
Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,
And their day goes over in idleness,
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'
The poem is about a hard-working, poor old woman who compares herself to the young women of the house who spend their days dreaming of love and worrying about their appearance. It is not clear whether these young women are her own children or the children of people she works for as a maid. The poem is written in the

3156,"The nervous system allows the body to respond to changes in the environment. This is a process usually coordinated by the brain. Reflex actions are extra-rapid responses to
things that set off a reaction in the nervous system - for example, light, heat, sound, gravity, smell, taste, or temperature. The singular is stimulus
, and this process also involves the nervous system, but bypasses the brain.
Receptors are groups of specialised cells. They can detect changes in the environment, which are called
, and turn them into electrical impulses. Receptors are often located in the
, such as the ear, eye and skin. Each organ has receptors sensitive to particular kinds of stimulus.
The central nervous system - CNS - in humans consists of the brain and spinal cord. When a receptor is stimulated, it sends a signal along the nerve cells - neurones - to the brain. The brain then co-ordinates the response.
An effector is any part of the body that produces the response. Here are some examples of effectors:
a muscle contracting to move the arm
a muscle squeezing saliva from the salivary gland

1676,"Despite the loss of political and religious freedom,
life improved in Germany for many ordinary people
who were prepared to 'toe the line' and look the other way.
Everybody had a job, and a wage. To people who had been unemployed and starving, 'work and bread' was a wonderful blessing worth every civil liberty they lost.
The Nazis set up KdF (Strength through Joy), which gave workers rewards for their work - evening classes, theatre trips, picnics, and even free holidays.
The Nazis devised a scheme to allow workers to buy a Volkswagen Beetle car for a small weekly payment.
People appreciated the public works - eg new schools and hospitals.
The streets were safe and there was no crime.
Germany was strong and successful in world affairs.
Nazi Youth groups provided activities and holidays for young people.
Nazi ideology gave people hope and confidence.

3441,"Shakespeare creates dramatic effect by switching a lot from one event to another. The switches tend to involve two things: a switch from one group of characters to another, and a change of mood, like switching from tragedy to humour.
For instance, the wedding scene is a terrible ordeal for Hero. It should have been the most important day in her life, and was almost as important to her father, but things go tragically wrong. Leonato wants to disown Hero, Beatrice wants to eat Claudio's ""heart in the market place"", and Benedick leaves to challenge his best friend to a duel. Things could not get any worse. However, Shakespeare suddenly switches the mood completely.

3531,"Once you have understood how to use the plot and the characters, you should move onto the themes. The themes are the basic ideas in Othello - we have already met one - the play deals with the subject of jealousy and revenge. There are others, such as race and foreign cultures or appearance and reality.
Perhaps the most obvious subject or theme in
. Iago is the key to almost everything that happens. He has been passed over for promotion, so he dislikes Othello and must be jealous of Cassio. He thinks Othello might also have slept with his wife. However, we can never be completely sure what motivates Iago to be so destructive - he manages to get Cassio dismissed but then Iago doesn't seem interested in Cassio's job, only in causing more problems. We also learn that Iago has tried many times in the past to steal the handkerchief that means so much to Othello. This tells us that he was planning against Othello long before his promotion was blocked.
Jealousy affects most other characters as well. Othello cannot bear the fact that his wife might be having an affair and Iago cleverly plays on this. For instance, when Othello thinks his wife is honest and needs proof of the affair, Iago asks if he would want to see her 'topped' (i.e. with a man on top of her) but then tells Othello to calm down and that his mind 'perhaps may change'. Of course it won't - Iago presents the worst image possible to Othello knowing the damage it will cause.
Jealousy affects almost all of us at sometime in our lives, and Shakespeare shows the destructive effects it has throughout the play. In fact only two characters seem unaffected by jealousy - Desdemona and Cassio. Desdemona dies, but everyone realises what a good woman she was, and Cassio is rewarded by taking Othello's place as general (and by deciding Iago's punishment).

3430,"Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look.
You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages.
Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right.
Stick to a simple, clear page layout
Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce.
A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages.
Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience!
Have consistent left-hand navigation on each page.
Don't have too much text on one page - people don't like scrolling down pages.
Break text up using bullet points, short paragraphs and tables. It's more difficult to read text on screen than it is on paper.
Keep graphics to a minimum. Graphics increase the page weight and increase the time pages take to download.
Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.
Bright colours and poor quality photographs are not very attractive
Here are some important rules to stick to when writing text for a website:
Stick to a single font colour and size on your website. Try to stick to black text on a white or light-coloured background.
Arial size 12 is easy to read on websites. Try not to use a smaller sized font.
Remember the intended audience. Always test your website on users.
Do not use underlining on webpages. Users will think it is a hyperlink and get confused when it doesn't link to another website.
Keep it simple. Be consistent across the whole website.
Webpages need file names. This allows you and visitors to your website to identify each webpage.
There are several rules you need to stick to when naming webpage files.
Use correct file extension names, eg .htm .html or .shtml.
Do not use symbols, eg + & % in file names.
Do no put spaces in your file or folder name. Use either dashes (-) or underscores (_)
Name your files sensibly. Video_intro.shtml, video_movie.shtm are easier to identify than page1.shtml, page2.shtml etc.
Webpage file names should mean something to you and the user
Keep html, image, flash and other media files in separate folders.
Put images in a folder called images, put audio files in a folder called audio.
There should be an index.shtml file in the site folder.
Do not create folders that contain too many or too few files.
All screen-based publications are likely to need some images. The things to keep in mind when selecting images are:
For the current eportfolio, you are only allowed to use jpg, png, gif and tif. You may need to use a graphics package to convert the graphic to a suitable format.
If they are copyright images, you will actually lose marks for putting them in (you could email the person who holds the copyright, but this can take months to sort out).
If not, use a graphics package to re-size or crop them. Editing inside Powerpoint or a website package is likely to spoil the way the graphic appears.
Have you updated your list of sources?
Each time you add a graphic to a publication, you should update your list of sources.
Can you use some of your own graphics?
It's a good idea to create some graphics. This could be with a digital camera or by doing some original artwork on the computer.
How much memory do the graphics take up?
Remember your eportfolio has a maximum size so keep an eye on individual graphics to make sure they are not too big.
At all times, make sure the graphic is suitable for the intended audience and purpose.
Before creating a website, make sure you know the difference between relative and absolute links.
These point to where the file you want to link to is saved. For example, Jeff is saving his files on his school network. He has a file called intro.html for which the absolute link is:
Look at the image below to see the folders in which intro.html sits.
The problem with absolute links is that the examiner will not have access to your schools server. When your folder and files are copied across to the exam boards server, any absolute links will not work.
For example, Jeff hands in his folder called
to the examiner. In this folder is another folder called
. The examiner, therefore, has access to everything stored within the jeffd201 folder. Now look at the absolute link again - everything that has been handed into the examiner is in bold:
The part that is not in bold represents the school's server, which the examiner
Therefore, you must use relative hyperlinks (the part in bold) when linking your webpages together.
As you have read above, an example of a relative link in Jeff's folder is:
This hyperlink just describes where the file (intro.html) is relative to the current file  in this case, in a subfolder called webpages.
Relative links make it easier to type hyperlinks  youre less likely to make errors. Files can be moved from a local system (your school server) to another server (the examination board).
Remember that the examiner will not have access to your school server. Never refer to the server, or absolute address when you use hyperlinks.
Now look at the image below taken from the examiner's computer. Notice how Jeff's files and folders have been copied on to the exam board's server.
The absolute link for Jeff's file has now changed to:
But notice how the relative link is still the same:
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce.
First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation.
Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience.
Listen carefully and improve your publication accordingly.
One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Include questions like:
Was the information at the right level?
Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language. HTML is used to make webpages. Many software packages such as Dreamweaver and Homesite allow you to build webpages and save them as html files.
The websites listed below offer HTML tutorials and advice for building your first website.
Practise your HTML in this online text editor with examples and tutorials.
This site is a bit patronising but is a good source of basic information
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format.
The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg.
These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos.
Images with few colours should be saved as a gif file
These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours.
If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost.
When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image.
To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop.

How can we know if there is something we call God?
There are five main arguments used to give proof that God exists. These arguments are usually applied to Christianity.
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
. Therefore God (like unicorns) exists in the mind.
It is not possible to think of any being greater than God (as God is
""that than which nothing greater can be conceived""
). Therefore God must exist in reality.
Everything has to come from something. You cannot make something out of nothing.
Therefore there must have been a First Cause that created the something (the universe). That First Cause is God.
If you were walking on a heath and saw a watch on the ground you would assume that its parts had not come together by chance because it is too ordered and complicated. Therefore someone must have designed it or it would not work.
Because the universe is also ordered and complicated, someone must have designed that too. That 'someone' is God.
Some people claim that they have had a religious experience eg, a miracle (a fortuitous event believed to have been caused by divine intervention), a vision, or a particular prayer to God answered.
Some people say that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong. They describe this as having a sense of morality.
This sense of morality has to come from somewhere, and the only possible source is God. Therefore God exists.

5491,"A reflex response to a new stimulus can be
trained dogs to expect food whenever he rang a bell. The dogs eventually produced saliva when they heard the bell ring.
The dog salivates naturally when given food.
Pavlov rings a bell every time the dog eats.
After much repetition the dog salivates when the bell rings, even when there is no food.
. The dogs were conditioned to salivate when the bell rang.
A ringing bell does not normally cause salivation in dogs. However, when the ringing bell becomes a secondary stimulus, it does cause salivation, even though the dog will not be able to eat the bell as food.
This is now called a conditioned reflex. In a conditioned reflex the final response (salivation) has no direct connection with the stimulus (ringing bell).
Predators mistake the hoverfly for a wasp due to similar markings
For example, birds will not eat caterpillars with bright colouring because they are conditioned to think of bright colours as poisonous. Some caterpillars use this to their advantage. Their bright colours protect them, even though they are not poisonous.
How often have you run away from a harmless hoverfly because it has the same markings as a wasp?
a reflex response. It does this by sending an impulse along a motor neuron of the reflex arc. This enables us, for example, to hold onto a hot dinner plate when normally we would drop it.
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

3794,"Infectious diseases are caused by the transmission of pathogens, which are microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. Pathogens can be transmitted by direct contact - horizontal and vertical transmission - and by indirect contact - vehicle-borne transmission and vector-borne transmission.
Pathogens are microorganisms that cause infectious disease. Bacteria and viruses are the main pathogens.
Bacteria come in many shapes and sizes, but even the largest are only 10 micrometres long (10 millionths of a metre).
Bacteria are living cells and, in favourable conditions, can multiply rapidly. Once inside the body, they release poisons or toxins that make us feel ill.
Hepatitis C virus. DNA are enclosed in a protein coat.
Viruses are many times smaller than bacteria. They are among the smallest organisms known and consist of a fragment of genetic material inside a protective protein coat.
Viruses can only reproduce inside host cells, and they damage the cell when they do this. A virus can get inside a cell and, once there, take over and make hundreds of thousands of copies of itself. Eventually the virus copies fill the whole host cell and burst it open. The viruses are then passed out in the bloodstream, the airways, or by other routes.

1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our
The material inside the nucleus of cells, carrying genetic information. DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid.
is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

Floods can cause damage to homes and possessions as well as disruption to communications. However, flooding can also have positive impacts on an area.
Flooding deposits fine silt (alluvium) onto the floodplain, making it very fertile and excellent for agriculture. People living on or near floodplains may rely upon regular flooding to help support their farming and therefore provide food.
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
by the effects of flooding. This is partly because LEDCs have more farms, and farming communities are attracted to fertile flood plains. LEDCs often do not have the resources to prevent flooding or deal with the aftermath of flooding.

1835,"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to
microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses
, and therefore its ability to stay fresh.
Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.
Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

5853,"New farming techniques and selective breeding ideas were introduced to Britain after 1750. These ideas helped to improve crop production and the quality of meat.
This Revision Bite will identify the main improvements made to agricultural techniques and the people responsible for these improvements.
began to reach Britain from abroad. Most of these ideas came from Holland and Denmark. At first, the ideas were not popular, but they soon started to spread across Britain because the farmers using them were making good profits.
Changes in farming techniques during this period were connected with:
that allowed better quality crops to be grown.
to produce bigger cattle and better meat.
Agricultural improvers played an important role in changing and improving British farming techniques. Improvers were divided into three categories:
- people who worked to improve the land.
- people who worked to improve the quality of cattle.
- people who worked to spread new ideas about farming techniques.
He popularised new techniques and proved that they were more profitable. He:
(wheat, turnips, barley, clover) to Britain. Turnips were used as a cleansing crop to allow the land to be hoed to kill the weeds, and clover was grown to replace the nutrients in the soil that the crops had depleted. This rotation prevented land from lying
An area of land which is left unseeded ie crops are not planted and left to grow.
and both turnips and clover were fodder crops, which could be fed to animals to allow more of them to survive cold winters.
, which mixed rich subsoil with a poorer sandy soil to produce better quality crops and increasingly more profit.
to encourage them to invest more money to experiment with new ideas and improving their land.
He is important because he introduced ideas that others went on to develop.
that planted seeds at the same depth in straight lines. This wasted less seeds and allowed farmers to manage their crops more easily.
that made it easier for farmers to weed between their seed rows.
In 1731, he wrote a book called ""
He was a pioneering selective breeder. His new methods were simple:
and bred from them. His most successful animals were the
New Leicester Sheep and the Dishley Longhorn cattle
. They were bigger animals, but they did not have better meat.
about his livestock, made sure they were very healthy and their stables and pens were always clean.
He was so successful that other farmers often hired his animals to breed from.
describing his new breeding techniques and their advantages.
They were also selective breeders, but not as well known as Robert Bakewell.
They improved on Robert Bakewell's methods and their main success was breeding the
, which were able to produce large amounts of milk and high quality lean meat for sale at market.
He was a propagandist for agricultural improvement who was convinced that Britain needed a strong agricultural community.
Young traveled around the country and some parts of Europe, writing
and also edited an agricultural journal called ""The Annals of Agriculture"".
secretary of the new Board of Agriculture
and encouraged the spread of new agricultural techniques and ideas.
Thomas William Coke - 1st Earl of Leicester
He was a Norfolk landowner who adopted and spread new agricultural methods on his farm in Norfolk.
to encourage them to try out new methods. He believed that if his tenant farmers felt they owned the land for a significant period of time, they would be more willing to invest in it.
Coke encouraged farmers to use the new techniques by
on his estate that demonstrated the newest methods. One such event was called Coke's Clipping. This was a competition to see how quickly a sheep could be sheared.
He was important for sharing and spreading new farming ideas.
Most examination boards will want you to answer a question about how important the different improvers were to the agricultural revolution. You need to revise at least two facts about each of the improvers so that you can answer either a three-mark question, or combine all your facts to answer an essay question worth 15 marks.
As part of your revision, think about the

3656,"These are standard tests to assess how well particular types of
a general term used to describe an application or a program
work. They are used to evaluate new software and hardware releases using a series of scored tests. Many computer magazines publish the test results. A typical test for a printer might be how long it takes to print a page of text.
It's a good way of getting cheap advice on the suitability of one product when compared to what else is available.
Benchmark tests may not include a feature that is really important to a particular end user. In fact they may be based on features the user may not be interested in at all.

4397,"There is no physical description of any of the characters. There is very little direct description of their feelings either, because Hemingway prefers to let us read between the lines.
The story seems to be told from Nick's viewpoint. Although it is told in the third person - both characters are referred to as 'he' and 'she' - the story remains with Nick after Marjorie has left, so we get his reaction to the break-up, but not hers.
Nick has planned to break up with Marjorie, and has discussed it with Bill beforehand - Bill asks: ""Did she go alright?"" You could see Nick as being unfair, since he has planned this and still goes on the fishing trip with her.
Nick seems to be quite aggressive at times in the story: when responding to things Marjorie says, and picking arguments.
He does not have the courage to break up with her outright - he has to pick an argument first. It is Marjorie who asks the definitive question.
Earlier in the story, is Nick trying to break the idea to Marjorie gently when he comments that the fish will not ""strike"" - in other words, they will not commit, like him?
Hemingway only directly mentions what the characters are feeling once or twice. He uses the word 'afraid' to describe Nick's feelings when he is talking to Marjorie. What do you think he is afraid of?
After Marjorie has gone, Nick seems upset. He tells Bill the break-up went fine, but is described as ""lying, his face on the blanket"". The 'lying' is
- is it about the position of his body or the truth of his words?
She seems more inclined to romance, likening the broken down mill to a 'castle'.
She also tries to draw Nick into a shared past, referring to it as 'our ruin'.
Hemingway says she ""loved fishing. She loved fishing with Nick."" The repetition seems to put emphasis on his presence being important to her. Nick says he has taught her everything about fishing. She has learned about it for his sake.
Marjorie is perceptive. She tells Nick he does not have to 'talk silly', and asks him: ""What's really the matter?""
She is very calm and collected throughout the story. She acts with dignity even when being dumped, and when he is snapping at her. When he says that love is not 'fun' anymore, she does not argue or protest. She merely leaves in dignified silence.
Bill is Nick's friend. Hemingway uses him to show what Nick is feeling, instead of telling us directly.
Bill knows that Nick is upset. When Nick tells him to 'go away', Bill moves a little way away, but remains in calling distance.
At the end, Bill's attitude to the picnic basket and fishing rods is very relaxed and casual - highlighting the tension in Nick's behaviour towards both earlier in the story.

5729,"Making decisions on moral issues is not easy. Religion helps followers to make decisions that are pleasing to God and create a society where people respect and care for each other
People draw on a variety of sources of authority to help them make a decision. For example:
religious leaders and the official teaching of their religion
There are two types of morality that affect the decisions people make  absolute morality and relative morality.
If you believe in absolute morality you will have faith that there is a right course of action to take in a moral dilemma, which is true in all situations regardless of culture, religious tradition, time or age.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would try to make sure that they were not involved in any killing, which would affect their views on issues such as war, abortion and euthanasia. They would say that these actions are wrong in all circumstances.
If you believe in relative morality you would agree that different courses of action might be needed in different situations.
How would a follower of this sort of morality respond to the commandment Do not kill? They would agree that killing is wrong, but would look at a range of other issues as well and say that sometimes killing might be necessary in a particular situation, such as abortion, if continuing the pregnancy would result in the birth of a very disabled child, or if the mother had been raped.

6792,"Fabrics usually need to be washed, bleached and dyed, before they are suitable for making into textile products. Often they need to be printed as well, using either block-printing or screen-printing techniques. Garments are assembled using various joining techniques including sewing, fusing and heat-sealing. Finishing is a process which improves the appearance, handle and performance of fabrics; while pressing is used to shape and stabilise fabrics.
Dyed cloth in a souk in Marrakesh
Before dyeing and printing the fabric is prepared by washing, bleaching and
treating cotton yarn with an alkali to improve its strength, lustre and receptivity to dye.
In industrial production fabric is dyed by continuous or batch dyeing:
, the fabric passes through a dye bath. The fabric is then squeezed between rollers to spread the dye evenly and remove excess dye. Continuous dyeing is used for colours that do not need to change too quickly with fashion.
, fabrics are produced without dye. They are then dyed to order in large batches according to the colours required. Batch dyeing is used for colours that need to change frequently with fashion.
Fabrics are printed by block or screen printing:
is done using metal or wooden blocks, one for each colour. The background shapes are cut away to leave a raised design on the block. Dye is applied and stamped onto the fabric. This is a very slow process used by specialised craft industries.
a pattern is printed onto fabric through a
a sheet of paper, celluloid, or other material in which a design has been cut, so that when ink is passed over the sheet the design is reproduced on the surface below
held in place by a screen. Each screen prints one part of the design in one colour. After printing the dyestuff must be fixed using steam or dry heat.
The graphics show three different types of screen printing.
is a slow process used by designer-makers for complicated fabric designs.
automates this process, with the fabric moved through the machine on a conveyor belt and the print repeating rapidly.

and roller squeegees - one roller for each colour; this is a very fast process used in the continuous printing of furnishing and clothing fabrics.
two fabrics together produces an unfinished seam. Finishing the seam prevents fraying and produces a hard-wearing, neat finish.

resin. Fusing is sometimes done by hand, sometimes by machine.
Fusing by hand is used to join Vilene to fabric to make it stable and strong. It is also used to reinforce and strengthen fabrics for garments, bags and accessories; and allows hems to be turned up without stitching.
In a factory there are two types of machine used for fusing: a flat-bed press is used to join short fabric lengths for batch production; a conveyor press is used for fusing long fabric lengths for mass production.
is used for synthetic fibres made from thermoplastics, such as polyester or nylon. Heat-sealing is used to set a material into a shape, eg pleats. It is also use to seal the seams on all-weather gear and tents to make them waterproof.
In industry a range of different sewing machines are used for stitching seams, embroidery, buttonholes etc. The main ones are listed in the table below:
Stitches, cuts and finishes seams in one process
Finishing is done to improve a product's appearance, properties and quality. It covers many different processes, some mechanical and some chemical.
Mechanical finishing uses heat, pressure and rollers to improve the appearance of the fabric.
cotton or nylon fabrics makes them fluffy and warm, with a soft

treated with an alkali to improve strength, lustre and receptivity to dye (of cotton)
using caustic soda. Mercerised fabrics are stronger, dye well and have improved lustre.
Wool can be given a shrink-resist finish using silicone or Teflon. This results in soft, smooth, lustrous yarns and fabrics that are machine-washable.
Cotton and viscose fabrics are given a crease-resistant finish using
'raw' plastic, especially when in semi-liquid form (Resistant materials). Substances (eg acrylics and urethanes) which, applied to a fabric's surface, evaporate to leave a film upon it (Textiles technology).

2496,"Energy generation from fossil fuels produces a build-up of gases - principally
- which is thought to be a major cause of global warming.
When fossil fuels are burnt - by industry, in power stations and in vehicles and planes - the gases enter the
The Earth's atmosphere is the envelope of gasses that surround the Earth. The gasses are held there by the Earth's gravity. The important gasses in the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide.
. Although these gases have always been present in the world's atmosphere, their concentration is gradually increasing as more and more fossil fuels are burnt.
Scientists believe that the build-up of these so-called
The main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. They are naturally occurring in atmosphere, but are believed to have increased through burning more oil, petrol, and coal, while forests have been removed.
in the atmosphere acts like a blanket or greenhouse around the planet; heat is trapped inside the Earth's atmosphere. This is the
, and the resulting increase in global temperatures is called
It's thought that the build-up of greenhouse gases impacts on global temperature in two ways:
The gases allow more of the sun's rays to enter the atmosphere. Some
Energy from the sun - consisting of visible light, heat or infra-red radiation, ultra-violet and other forms of radiation.
is still reflected back into space by the outer parts of the atmosphere, but it's believed the amount reflected back is gradually reducing.
At the same time, the greenhouse gases absorb more of the solar radiation that is reflected back from the Earth's surface - trapping heat and keeping it in the atmosphere. The ability of the atmosphere to capture the sun's warmth is essential for life on earth. But if significantly MORE warmth is being captured, this is bad news for the planet.
Another group of greenhouse gases includes the
for short). CFCs have been responsible for depleting the
ozone layer as they attack and destroy ozone molecules.
The ozone layer is a high level layer of gas in the stratosphere. The ozone helps to keep out harmful ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn on human skin and damage plants.
The resulting ozone holes let harmful ultra-violet radiation in and add to the greenhouse effect.
CFCs can be used in aerosols, such as hairspray cans, fridges and in making foam plastics.
CFCs were banned in many countries in the mid-1990s after it was found that they were breaking up the Earth's ozone.

4312,"The development of steam power was crucial to the Industrial Revolution because it was the main source of power that operated the machinery used in industry.
The developments in equipment helped to increase production, formed the basis of railway transport and introduced new machinery for agriculture.
The Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the steam engine.
in 1696, as many books claim. Saverys engine filled a cylinder with steam, and then cooled it, thereby condensing it. This created a vacuum that sucked up water from the mine.
first used in a mine in Dudley in 1712. He used the vacuum created by condensing the steam to power a piston. The piston was attached to pump rods, which worked a pump to pump out the mines.
took the steam engine and developed it further. The improvements he made created the machine that became the basis of all the power in the Industrial Revolution. Watts inventions included:
cooled the steam by exhausting it into a separate chamber
. The cylinder could, therefore, always be kept hot and the separate condenser always cool. This meant huge amounts of fuel were saved.
Turned the up-and-down motion of the piston into a rotary motion
, which allowed the steam engine to be used to power machinery and wheels.
and used steam pressure to force the piston both ways. This invention became the basis of the steam train.
Regulated the admission of steam into the cylinder
, which not only made the engines safer, but meant they could be kept at a regular speed.

3802,"Sea water contains a number of dissolved salts. When these salts dissolve in water, the ions separate. Sea water therefore contains a mixture of ions. The most common ions in sea water are shown in the table:
It is possible to deduce from the table which salts dissolved to form the mixture of ions:
When sodium chloride dissolves it forms sodium ions and chloride ions.
When magnesium chloride dissolves it forms magnesium and chloride ions.
When magnesium sulfate dissolves if forms magnesium ions and sulfate ions.
When potassium chloride dissolves it forms potassium ions and chloride ions.
When potassium bromide dissolves it forms potassium ions and bromide ions.
You can use the charge on the ions shown in the table to work out the formulae of the ionic compounds.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt sodium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:1. So the formula of sodium chloride is NaCl.
. For the charges to cancel out in the neutral salt magnesium chloride, they must be in a ration of 1:2. So the formula of magnesium chloride is MgCl
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

2123,"Fractions, decimals and percentages can all represent the same information. But can you convert between them?
To change a fraction to a decimal, you divide the top number by the bottom number. (Divide the numerator by the denominator.)
to a decimal, we calculate 3  8
Some decimals will terminate (end) like the example above, but many will not.
There are some fraction/decimal equivalents that you should be familiar with:
If the decimal terminates (ends), the denominator will be 10, or 100, or 1000 or (depending on the number of decimal places).
0.5 means 'five tenths, so 0.5 =
0.45 means '45 hundredths', so 0.45 =
0.240 means 240 thousandths, so 0.240 =
If the decimal repeats with a single digit, the denominator will be 9:
If the decimal repeats with two digits, the denominator will be 99:
If the decimal does not repeat at all it is known as an irrational number, and you cannot write it as a fraction.

5479,"Chemical synthesis is the procedure used to make useful compounds. This often involves a number of chemical reactions and other processes.
In the synthesis of any chemical compound in useful quantities, there are a number of common stages:
Choosing a reaction to make the desired product
as possible. The reaction must also be as easy to carry out as possible.
. The risk involved must be as
Working out the quantities of reactants to use
Using too much of one of the reactants would be
Carrying out the reaction using suitable apparatus, in the right conditions
. This will make the product as cheaply as possible. The correct concentrations, pressure or catalyst may be required.
Separating the product from the reaction mixture
Some of the reactants may remain, and
Measuring the yield and checking the purity of the product

a logarithmic scale used to measure the impact of an earthquake
The effects of an earthquake can be devastating - they can destroy settlements, change landscapes, and cause many deaths.
is the shaking and vibration of the Earth's crust due to movement of the Earth's plates (plate tectonics). Earthquakes can happen along any type of plate boundary.
Earthquakes occur when tension is released from inside the crust. Plates do not always move smoothly alongside each other and sometimes get stuck. When this happens pressure builds up. When this pressure is eventually released, an earthquake tends to occur.
The point inside the crust where the pressure is released is called the focus. The point on the Earth's surface above the
Earthquake energy is released in seismic waves. These waves spread out from the focus. The waves are felt most strongly at the epicentre, becoming less strong as they travel further away. The most severe damage caused by an earthquake will happen close to the

1793,"The search to combat disease gained enormous
in the 19th century. Instruments such as the
were invented, and research into inoculation began to bear fruit.
Methods of diagnosis changed massively during the course of the 19th century.
(France: 1816) invented the stethoscope and started the practice of 'auscultation' (listening to the patient's chest).
(France: 1834) argued that symptoms were irrelevant, and that what was happening inside the body was much more important when it came to diagnosing illness. As a result, doctors made diagnoses on the basis of a full clinical examination of the 'signs' made by the disease on the body.
(Germany: 1878) developed the technique of biopsy (removing cells to determine if they were cancerous).
to measure the functions of the body precisely:
(Germany: 1847) invented the kymograph (which measured the pulse).
(Holland: 1900) invented the electrocardiograph (which measures heart activity).
The search for new ways to cure disease also gained momentum in the 19th century, and included the discovery of how
Usually a medical injection, which introduces a weakened dose of harmful disease-causing organisms into a patient's body. This induces the body to develop an immunity to the disease, which protects the patient from the full-blown sickness.
(France: 1880) discovered by chance (when he left bacteria exposed to air) that injecting chickens with an attenuated (weakened) form of chicken cholera gave them immunity to the disease (ie he discovered the principle of inoculation).
That realisation was the start of an important chain of events.
developed an effective inoculation against anthrax (1881), and rabies (1885).
(France: 1906) developed the BCG injection against TB.
(Germany: 1913) developed an anti-toxin against diphtheria.
(Germany: 1890s) reasoned that, if certain dyes could stain bacteria, perhaps certain chemicals could kill them. He set up a private laboratory and a team of scientists. By 1914 they had discovered several 'magic bullets' - compounds that would have a specific attraction to disease-causing microorganisms in the body, and that would target and kill them. These were methylene blue (for malaria), trypan red (for sleeping sickness) and Salvarsan (for syphilis) - although Salvarsan was more effective than the other two.
Preparations, often made of weakened viruses of a disease. These are given to a sick person (often by injection), in order to protect him or her from that disease, by causing the body to form antibodies against it.
, however (eg one developed by Robert Koch against TB in 1891), were not successful. And against
. They carried, as one medical historian wrote, 'a box of blanks'. So people looked elsewhere for their cures - sometimes in strange places.
A home medicine encyclopaedia of 1910 recommended cures that included electrical shocks, injection with animal hormones, and a range of
Other alternative medical treatments included mesmerism (hypnotism), homeopathy (taking tiny doses of poisons), 'health reform' (a religious movement which recommended a healthy lifestyle - it was run by John Kellogg whose brother invented cornflakes) and Christian Science (which taught that disease only existed in the mind).

The world around us: Finding the way
When you're dealing with directions you need to think about both parts of the instruction. What is it telling you to do?
And in which direction or where is it telling you to go?
Often there will be direction expressions in the question that you can recycle. If you're not sure which one to choose, take away the expressions you do know and see what you've got left.
When writing your own directions, don't try to translate word for word from English. Look at the expressions used in the question and try to keep to that form.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.

2114,"Back at school, Scout learns about Hitler's treatment of the Jews and is amazed that no one in Maycomb seems able to connect that to the racism in the town.
Mr Ewell tries to break into Judge Taylor's house and menaces Tom Robinson's widow.
They are both attacked on Halloween night
Jem and Scout attend a Halloween pageant at school - its subject is the history of Maycomb county and Scout is dressed as a shoulder of ham. She misses her entry on stage and so decides to keep her costume on to walk home in, to hide her embarrassment. It is a dark night and Jem soon realises they are being followed. They are both attacked - Scout is squashed inside her costume and Jem breaks his arm. Someone carries Jem home.
The attacker was Mr Ewell: he is found dead, with a kitchen knife in his ribs.

1615,"is part of a line which has two end points (ie, it is not infinite). Each end of a line segment is usually labelled with letters.
If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y
And the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of X and Y.

6135,"What to look for in your comparison
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint.
Both express love. Shakespeare writes to his mistress, Hopkins writes about a much-loved landscape.
Shakespeare mocks the common cliches that poets use about their mistresses - lips redder than coral, breasts whiter than snow, etc - to emphasise the reality of his love. Hopkins also wants to get away from the cliched use of language - by inventing words, like rollrock and twindles, to pinpoint his meaning.
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, and both express danger as well as beauty.
However, in Clarke's poem man has caused the destruction already (cutting hay kills the field mouse; war is taking place in Bosnia) - Hopkins' poem is a plea to stop man from causing destruction.
Images or things (usually physical, like a flag) that stand for or represent something else - usually abstractions, like a nation. A crucifix is a symbol of Christianity.
to convey their message. The central image for Clarke is the field mouse, which represents all the innocent, vulnerable people in the world who are killed or injured. Inversnaid represents all areas of wet and wilderness in the world that mankind could jeopardise.
Both poems describe watery river scenes, but while Perch is purely a vivid word-picture, Inversnaid contains more of an explicit 'message'.
The language in Perch has many similarities with the Hopkins poem: combination words and word-plays (alder-dapple, finland of perch) dialect and obsolete words (grunt, slub, runty, adoze) and lots of sound devices. The unorthodox grammar of on hold / In the everything flows and steady go of the world (where the last 8 words make up a giant compound noun) is very like Hopkins.
While the Hopkins poem is full of movement, and ranges over the landscape, the Heaney poem stays very still and focused on the almost motionless fish, adoze in the current.
How does the rhythm and rhyme scheme of Perch compare with that of Inversnaid?
Both poems are written from a personal viewpoint, describing an experience which is for the poet is intensely present.
Both poets use an extended image to put their point across. The canary-yellow cotton jacket is the central image in Homecoming. A row over the jacket caused the family row; the reconciliation is likened to putting the jacket back on. For Hopkins, the darksome burn represents all areas of wilderness in the world that could be vulnerable to man.
language to help us 'hear' events in the poem - Temper, temper... Blue murder. Hopkins uses different techniques -
Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad.
Words that sound the same through the use of similar vowels or consonants, eg hot and slop or fold and filled.
The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry.
- to help us hear the sound of the rushing water.
The way a text is built and shaped. Chapters, plot, acts and scenes, stanzas, narrative, verse-form, rhyme and rhythm - all these (and many more) are aspects of structure.
In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound.

Hopkins writes from personal experience whereas Duffy's poem is a dramatic

to show the intensity of the love, while Hopkins invents words or uses dialect (a windpuff bonnet of fawn-froth) to convey his feelings.
Anne Hathaway's love of Shakespeare is confident and will last forever - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head - while Hopkins' is more tentative - he fears for the future and asks What would the world be? without the wilderness his poem evokes.

3045,"There were two types of water transport available in Britain before the 18th century - coastal shipping and navigable rivers. However, although both these methods were useful, they still had their problems, so something new was needed...
Bad weather was a risk of coastal shipping
, but ships could be affected by tides, winds and pirates.
Heavy goods such as coal and iron could only be transported by coastal shipping and not by roads.
Some rivers had to be widened and deepened for large ships
Rivers that were large enough and deep enough to link towns and cities in Britain were called navigable rivers.
The main navigable rivers in Britain were the Thames, Severn, Humber, Trent and Mersey.
rivers were widened and deepened by local communities
While coastal shipping and navigable rivers were useful, there needed to be a more effective form of transport than roads and the existing water transport. The main reasons for change were:
during winter and dry up during summer months.
did not always link the major towns
A rapidly growing population also needed a more efficient method of transport because
canals would be the next step forward
Read this Revision Bite and then attempt to write down the information that you consider to be
for revising the early problems with pre-18th century water transport.
As part of your revision, think carefully about the

6501,"A distant relative of Utterson, Enfield is a well-known man about town and the complete opposite to Utterson.
Poole appears briefly in the novel from time to time, notably when Utterson goes to visit Jekyll.
In Chapter 8, he goes to Utterson's house to report the strange goings on in Jekyll's house. He helps Utterson to break down the door.
Sir Danvers is a distinguished elderly gentleman who is beaten to death by Hyde. This is a turning point in the novel.
Mr Guest is Utterson's secretary and a handwriting expert. In Chapter 5, he comments on the remarkable similarity between Jekyll and Hyde's handwriting.

3833,"You will recall that genes have different forms called alleles. An allele can be recessive or dominant.
allele only shows if the individual has two copies of the recessive allele. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of the allele to have blue eyes.
allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of the allele. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of the allele to have brown eyes (and two copies will still give you brown eyes).
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a recessive allele. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty allele to have CF. If you just have one copy of the faulty allele, you are a carrier but have no symptoms. If two carriers have a child between them, there is a

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The opening
The play starts by telling us what will happen at the end. A girl and a boy from two warring families will die. Their deaths will put an end to the violence. The action is set in Verona in Italy.
These equally rich and powerful families are:
Two of Capulet's servants pick a fight in the market place with one of Montague's servants. Benvolio tries to stop the fight. Tybalt attacks Benvolio. A riot starts. Prince Escalus stops the riot and warns that if the Montagues and the Capulets are involved in any more violence the punishment will be death.
Luckily, Romeo wasn't involved, but his mother and father wonder where he is. Benvolio has seen him moodily wandering about by himself. He says he will try to find out what is wrong with Romeo.
Romeo tells Benvolio that he is in love with a girl called Rosaline. He is in agony because she doesn't love him back. Benvolio's advice is to look at other attractive girls. Romeo says that no other girl could ever live up to Rosaline.

595,"> The Tempest Summary - The shipwreck
Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.
As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"". It is clear, too, from the names he calls him, that Prospero has not forgiven Caliban for an attack he once made on his daughter.

or get bigger when they are heated up. They
or get smaller when they are cooled down. This property can be useful.
Thermometers work because the liquid inside them expands and rises up the tube when it gets hotter.
Metal parts can be fitted together without welding using shrink fitting. The animation shows how this works.
The rod is too big to fit through the hole.
Materials expanding and contracting can also cause problems. For example, bridges expand in the summer heat and need special joints to stop them bending out of shape.
When substances expand or contract, their particles stay the same size. It is the

456,"Test your listening skills with this quiz. Note down your answer to the questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of listener you are.
1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you:
a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say.
b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing.
c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas.
2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you:
a) Point at her and burst out laughing.
b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you.
c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said.
3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you:
a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway.
b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings.
c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along.
4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you:
a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak.
b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum.
c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced.
You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often.
You probably are a good listener...but nobody knows it. Try to be brave and ask people questions during discussions. At least it will take the focus away from you, if that's what you want.

112,"> Drama - Working from a script
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Which way worked better? Using the punctuation as your guide makes it sound like a real person thinking aloud.

412,"You already know that the volume of a cuboid is
length by its breadth by its height (l  b  h)
The area of the shaded end of the cuboid (the cross section) is b  h, so you can also say that the volume of a cuboid is:
volume of a cylinder = area of circle  length
volume of triangular prism = area of triangle  length
volume of 'L'-shaped prism = area of 'L'-shape  length
Q1. What is the volume of this triangular prism?
Q2. What is the volume of this prism?
A1. volume = area of triangle  length
A2. The area of the cross section is 5cm
and the length is 8cm, so the volume is 5  8 = 40 cm
Remember that the volume is the area of the cross section  the length.

Magnets and electric current - Heating effect
Household wires and cables transfer electricity very efficiently. That means they dont lose much of the energy as heat on the way. The electricity flows freely from the plug and is transferred into other forms of energy in household appliances, like toasters, lights and CD players.
The heating element in a toaster is made from a special wire different to wire in the power cables. The wire in the heating element transfers lots of its electrical energy into
and gets very hot. Exactly what you need to make toast or run an electric heater.
In most uses of electricity we don't want to produce heat. Any heat that is produced is wasted energy. Appliances that transfer less of the electricity they use into wasted heat are more
For example energy efficient light bulbs transfer less of their energy into heat. They also use less energy than normal bulbs to produce the same amount of light. So the energy efficient light bulb wastes less energy.

Aled carried out a survey to see how many of his classmates are left-handed. His results are shown in the table below:
This is an example of a two-way table and it is used to show two different features in a survey.
You can find out lots of information from this table. For example, you can see that there are 2 left-handed boys in the class. You can also see that there are 13 girls in the class (1 left-handed and 12 not left-handed)
Q1. How many right-handed children are there in the class?
Q2. How many children are there in total?
A1. There are 14 right-handed boys and 12 right-handed girls, so 14 + 12 =
This is the total of all the numbers in the table.

This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well.
I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen.
The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start.
A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options.
The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense.
Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food.
The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced.
So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

104,"What is wrong with the following statement?
The probability of obtaining a 6 when I throw a die is
- so if I throw the die 6 times I should get exactly 1  6.
In theory this statement is true, but in practise it might not be the case. Try throwing a die 6 times - you won't always get one 6.
Kate and Josh each throw a die 30 times.
a) How many times would you expect Kate to obtain a 6?
b) How many times would you expect Josh to obtain a 6?
c) How many times would you expect Kate or Josh to obtain a 6?
a) In theory, Kate should obtain a 6 on
of her throws. Therefore, in theory she should throw a 6 on
b) Josh should also throw to obtain a 6 on
c) In total, Kate and Josh have thrown the die 60 times. You would expect them to obtain a 6 on 10 of those throws. However, it is very unlikely that Kate and Josh obtained exactly the same results, or that either of them threw a 6 on 5 occasions.
As you can see, if an experiment is repeated, the results are not necessarily the same each time.
However, it is more likely that their combined results were closer to the expected outcome (10  6s) than their individual results.
In other words, if you do a large number of trials you will get a more accurate result.

More on formulas - Collecting like terms
, remember that any term that contained the same letter can be combined by adding and subtracting.
3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g
= 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k
Like terms with powers can be added or subtracted but only if the powers are the same.
x is not the same as x
, so they cannot be added together.
Rearrange the expression so that like terms are next to each other:
+ 3x - 2x + 5 - 1
People usually write the expression with the 'x
' term first, then the 'x' term and finally the number term.
To get the answer, rearrange the expression:
+ 2x - 4x + 5 - 3

619,"> Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties.
Solid (except mercury, which is a liquid)
About half are solids, about half are gases, and one (bromine) is a liquid
High (they feel heavy for their size)
Low (they feel light for their size)
Brittle (they break or shatter when hammered)
Poor (they are insulators, apart from graphite)
They make a ringing sound (they are sonorous)
Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others
For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

235,"> Tone and style - Style tips
Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do?
At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer?
Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it.
Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then...
The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.

Formal and informal writing - Informal writing
Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural.
Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language?
b) An essay about a Shakespeare play
c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger
e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person)
b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style.
Tips to make your informal writing more effective
""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter.""
2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing:
""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop.""
3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students:
""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this.""
Don't baffle your reader with too much slang.
Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read.
Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island.
If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!

336,"When describing coordinates, always count from the origin.
For example, to describe the position of point A, start at the origin and move two squares in the horizontal (x) direction. Then move three squares in the vertical (y) direction.
The coordinates of point A are therefore (2, 3).

The Tempest first key extract - Performance
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict.
Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak.
Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage.
When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can.
When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience.
You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas:
The characters and how you respond to them
The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example
The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power
The performance instructions, such as stage directions

403,"> Reproduction - Fertilisation and foetal development
During sexual intercourse the man's penis releases semen into the woman's vagina. Sperm cells travel in semen from the penis and into the top of the vagina. They enter the uterus through the cervix and travel to the egg tubes. If a sperm cell meets with an egg cell there, fertilisation can happen. Fertilisation happens when an egg cell meets with a sperm cell and joins with it.
The fertilised egg divides to form a ball of cells called an

532,"> Graphs - The form x = c and y = c
Graphs - The form x = c and y = c
Graphs of this type have either a horizontal or vertical straight line.
All the points on this line have a y coordinate of 4 so you can say that the equation of the line is y = 4.
All the points on this line have an x coordinate of 7 so you can say that the equation of the line is x = 7.
All vertical line graphs have an equation of the form x = c
eg x = 1, x = -3, x = 4, etc.
All horizontal line graphs have an equation of the form y=c
eg y = 3, y = -2, y = 1, etc.
If you can't remember whether the equation of the line is of the form x = ... or y = ..., find the coordinates of at least two points on the line.
If the x coordinates are the same, the equation of the line will be x = ...
If the y coordinates are the same, the equation of the line will be y = ...
Get from X to Y with this activity.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as
. Think of what happens when you rub your hands together quickly. The friction warms them up.
as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

172,"In this Revision Bite we'll look at the feeding relationships between living things. These can be shown in food chains and food webs.

191,"Persuasive texts try to persuade you to do something - like buy something or give money to charity. Magazine articles and newspaper reports may try to persuade you to agree with them.
Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself?
Here's how to spot this type of text:
It tries to convince you to do or agree with something.
It contains a mix of fact and opinion.
It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language.
It often seems to speak directly to the reader.
Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.
Here's an extract from an argument text:
Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban.
Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled.
Here are some clues to help you identify an argument text:
It discusses an issue, considering all points of view.
It often uses a formal and impersonal style to seem balanced.
It uses connectives to connect points, for example ""however"", ""but"", ""similarly""

If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4).
If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4).
If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8).
If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40).
Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio.
Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form.
To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28.
2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14.
You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is
No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio.

Changes in the environment - Climate change
Some heat energy from the Earths surface escapes into space. If too much heat energy escaped, the planet would be very cold. However some gases in the atmosphere can trap escaping heat energy, causing some of it to pass back to the surface.
, and they keep our planet warm, which is a good thing.
such as oil, coal and natural gas. The energy released is used to power cars and other machines, to generate electricity, and to keep buildings warm. The burning fuel releases waste gases, including carbon dioxide. As the human population increases, more fuel is used, and more carbon dioxide is released.
The extra carbon dioxide increases the greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped by the atmosphere, causing the planet to become warmer than it would be naturally. The increase in global temperature this causes is called
The amount of carbon dioxide in the air has increased a lot in recent years
The average temperature of the planet has increased in recent years
Global warming is beginning to cause big changes in the environment. These include:
ice melting faster than it can be replaced in the Arctic and Antarctic
the oceans warming up  their water is expanding and causing sea levels to rise
changes in where different species of plants and animals can live

523,"Gordon Zwicky knows how to tell a tall tale. He is a champion liar. Zwicky recently beat 299 contestants from the United States and Canada to win the Burlington Liar's Club contest.
To win the contest, Zwicky, who lives in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, told a tall tale about a trip he took to Florida with his wife.
He said that he had won the lottery and decided to drive to Florida. A friend had warned him to read traffic signs carefully and he wouldn't have any problems.
Shortly after setting out on the trip, Zwicky saw a sign that said, ""Clean Restrooms Ahead."" He arrived in Florida two months later--after cleaning 450 restrooms.

550,"A filmmaker finds out that elephant families can be comfortable with visitors.
""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.
(died at age 34): She was Echo's eldest daughter. Erin died from a spear injury after she wandered too close to a watering hole protected by the local Masai people.
(age 22): As a young calf, Eliot would to run up and rest her head on researchers' vehicles. Now that she has grown up, Eliot keeps her distance from people.
(age 17): When he was born, Ely couldn't walk. The family waited to move until he stood on his own. Now he lives alone. He left the herd at age 12.
(age 25): Edwina is Echo's first known grandchild.
(age 22): Eleanor helped care for Email after Erin died.
(age 6): Email's mother, Erin, died when he was 2. Now the rest of the family takes care of him.
(age 12): Europa is Echo's first known great-grandchild.
(age 8): Elaine is Echo's second great-granddaughter.
(age 8): Elmo is Echo's only surviving great-grandson.
Why might African elephants need to communicate with each other?

11,"As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are getting bounced around. A new study, published in the medical journal
shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

52,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

198,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

488,"Our sun is a seething ball of hot gases. The sun is always active, but for the rest of this year, the sun will be more active than usual, scientists say.
Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the
, which are shifting curtains of colored light.
When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

771,"A new study shows that the amount of time you sleep affects how well you do in school.
tell when you stay up late? Think again.
During a recent sleep study, teachers noticed that kids had more difficulty learning when they stayed up an hour or two past their bedtime. ""Getting [to sleep] on time is as important as getting [to school] on time,"" says Gahan Fallone, who helped conduct the research.
Scientists followed 74 students ages 6 to 12 from Rhode Island and Massachusetts for the three-week study. During that time, the researchers tracked the sleeping habits of students. Teachers, who werent told how long the kids slept or which week they stayed up late, rated the students performance in school.
The teachers could tell when students didnt get enough sleep. Students who slept eight hours or less a night were more forgetful, had more trouble paying attention, and had difficulty learning new lessons.
How much sleep do kids need? Health experts from the National Sleep Foundation recommend that students ages 7 to 10 get at least 10 hours of sleep a night.
Teachers and principals have long been aware that students who get enough sleep generally perform better in school, which leads to better grades. At Potter- Burns Elementary in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, school officials send notes home to parents asking them to make sure kids get enough shut-eye before the yearlyachievement tests. ""Definitely there is impact on students performances if they come to school tired,"" says the schools principal, John Haidemenos.

35,"Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader?
How many sides does a rhombus have?
Which planet is typically the brightest in the night sky?
In what month do we observe Columbus Day?
Stumped? Those are just a few of the questions that have challenged adult contestants on the TV quiz show
Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?
Fox's hit show, hosted by the comedian Jeff Foxworthy, is making the grade with audiences. About 26.5 million viewers tuned in for the
or first show, earlier this year. It was the biggest audience for a U.S. television premiere in more than eight years.
In each episode, adult contestants are quizzed on a series of questions from their elementary school days. The grown-ups tackle questions in various subjects, including math, science, geography, and social studies. The player's goal is to answer 10 questions plus a bonus correctlyand then take home $1 million!
But the show has a twist: The players are not alone. Five fifth graders appear on each episode to lend a hand. The kids have their favorite subjects. Ten-year-old Kyle Collier from Los Angeles, California, is fond of math, reading, and history.
The show offers up its share of embarrassment for the grown-ups. If a contestant drops out or answers incorrectly and isn't ""saved"" by a fifth grader, the player must face the camera and say, ""I'm not smarter than a fifth grader."" The program airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

446,"One Missouri family finished a yearlong history lesson. The family visited all 50 capitol buildings in the United States.
Fred and Ginger Gall and their three sons--ages 13, 11, and 6--wrapped up their adventure in early August. Their final stop was at their home state's capitol building in St. Louis.
It took them a little more than a year to complete their journey, covering a total of 48,000 square miles. They traveled across the country in a mobile home.
Although the kids attend school in Missouri, they were home-schooled during their trip. Their parents said the trip was a chance to teach their sons about the history of the United States. As part of their schooling, the kids used their textbooks from their school.
They had many field trips to add to the mix. In addition to visiting all the capitol buildings, the family stopped at science and history museums and national parks along the way.
What sent them packing? ""Our friends from another country had seen more of [the United States] than we had,"" said Ginger Gall. ""There was something wrong with that picture.""

630,"The bald eagle is flying high! This majestic bird has clawed its way back from the edge of
About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year.
In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States.
Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained.
What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs.
Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters.
was being destroyed as people cut down trees to build roads and homes. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback.
, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told
In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird.""

455,"Should Native American mascots and logos be banned from college sports?
A spectacular tradition of college football takes place before every Florida State University (FSU) home game. A student dressed as the famous Seminole leader Chief Osceola (ah-see-OH-luh) charges down the field on a horse. The student launches a flaming spear into the air, which lands midfield. The fans, a sea of red and gold, cheer wildly.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tried to end that tradition. The NCAA is the organization that oversees college sports. The NCAA banned the use of Native American names, logos, or
by sports teams after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team.
Seminole tribes in Florida and Oklahoma objected to the ban. The NCAA then removed FSU from its list of universities that are not allowed to use such names and mascots. Although the chief will ride again, the ban remains for at least 17 schools with Native American team names and mascots. Check out both sides of the debate.
Some Native Americans are offended that some sports teams use mascots and logos from their culture. They think it promotes
A stereotype is an idea that all members of a group of people are alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true.
""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers, speak in broken English, and dance barefoot,"" John Sanchez, a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe, told
""This is not honoring; it is making fun of.""
Those against the NCAA's new rules, including many Native Americans, say the recent ban is ridiculous. They believe that team names and mascots honor the traditions of Native Americans.
Florida Governor Jeb Bush challenged the ban. He said it insulted Seminoles who support FSU's traditions. Seminole tribe members designed the mascot's costume, say others. They add that the student who rides Chief Osceola's horse earns that honor after studying the tribe's culture.

302,"A Letter from First Lady Laura Bush to
On September 11, 2001, many Americans lost mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and friends in a national tragedy. Those who knew them are feeling a great loss, and you may be feeling sorrow, fear, and confusion as well.
The feelings and thoughts that surround this tragedy are as plentiful as they are conflicting. I want to reassure you that there are many people including your family, your teachers, and your school counselors, who are there to listen to you.
September 11 changed our world. But with each story of sorrow and pain comes one of hope and courage. As we move forward, all of us have an opportunity to become better people and to learn valuable lessons about heroism, love, and compassion.
As we mourn those who died, let us remember that as Americans, we can be proud and confident that we live in a country that symbolizes freedom and opportunity to millions throughout the world. Our nation is strong, and our people resilient. We have a well-earned reputation for pulling together in the worst of times to help each other.

223,"A new study shows that kids who have a TV in their bedrooms get less sleep than other kids. Sleep experts at Brown University say about 30 percent of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.
According to sleep experts, kids who have TVs in their bedrooms go to bed later, have problems going to sleep, and are more likely to wake up during the night than kids who don't have TVs in their rooms.

716,"Daredevil skateboarder Danny Way, 31, jumped into the record books this summer. He became the first person in history to jump over the Great Wall of China on a skateboard.
Way made the jump using a massive ramp. He helped build the ramp near his home in California. The ramp propelled him over the wall at nearly 50 miles an houralmost as fast as a car travels!
""I was aware of the dangers and my heart was pumping in my chest the whole time, but I managed to pull it off with the help of my team,"" says Way.
Way fell on his first attempt leaping over the historic wall. On his second try, he made it over the wall, which stretches about 61 feet across. He completed the jump four times in alland even added 360-degree spins on his last three tries in front of his family and thousands of people.
More than 2,000 years old, the Great Wall of China is the largest structure ever built. Experts estimate that the wall is about 4,500 miles long.
Way has been skateboarding since he was 6 years old. Setting world records is nothing new to him. Way holds both the distance record of 79 feet and the height record of more than 23 feet for a skateboard jump.

70,"Weeks before Election Day, Michigan teen Michael Sessions would race home from school, finish his homework, and hit the streets to persuade people to vote for him. His mom tried to make him wear his coat To City Hall out in the cold, but he didnt listen and got sick.

Since his four-year term began in November, the young politician is juggling school with work. What made him want to run for mayor? ""Ive just watched the city decline,"" he told
""I thought, well, maybe I could be a spark plug who goes in here and says, Look, were going to lose this town. ""

254,"When thousands of baseball fans head to ballparks this summer, chances are theyll have trouble reciting the words to our national anthem. Two out of three Americans dont know the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" according to a recent Harris Poll.
As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americas official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle.
The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize.
Why dont people know the words to our countrys most famous tune? ""We see it as a consequence that music education programs are being diminished in schools,"" project spokesperson Elizabeth Lasko told
""[People who do] know the words say they learned them in school.""
or end, in Baltimore, Maryland, at Fort McHenry on September 14. That date and that place are when and where Francis Scott Key penned the poem that later became the national anthem.
According to the National Anthem Project, the song represents our countrys history and culture. Many people sing it at community events.
""We want people to know the words so they sing it together,"" says Lasko. ""If youre taught as a young person to sing it, youll always be able to sing it."" For more information on the National Anthem Project and tour cities, visit
During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem.
On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem.
Here is the first verse of the four-verse song:
O say, can you see, by the dawns early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through
     the perilous fight,
Oer the ramparts we watched, were so
     gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting
     in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was
     still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free, and the home of the

President Lincoln (center) meets with Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand (right), during Battle of Antietam, (Maryland), October 3, 1862. Allan Pinkerton of the Secret Service is on the left.
Ten Civil War battlefields have been placed on the Civil War Preservation Group's ""most endangered"" list. This organization works to
, or protect, historic Civil War battlefields. These battlefields are threatened by the development of roads, stores, and homes.
The U.S. Civil War between the Northern States and Southern States lasted from 1861 to 1865. About 620,000 Americans died in the Civil War. That is more than any other war in U.S. history. The Civil War was triggered by the election in 1860 of President Abraham Lincoln. He wanted to
, or end, slavery. The South wanted the right to own slaves. The North wanted to end the practice of slavery.
In 1861, the South decided to break away, or
, from the United States. The Civil War ended when the South surrendered in 1865. More than 4 million slaves were freed.

172,"Joseph DAngeli lives with vampiresvampire bats, that is. He feeds bats and studies their habits. DAngeli is a
(kigh-rop-TAH-luh-jist), or a scientist who studies bats.
This man is not a superhero, but he knows a lot about bats.
The weekend before Halloween, DAngeli is bringing his bats to the Chiller Theatre Toy, Model, and Film Expo in Secaucus, New Jersey. Its the countrys largest horror and science-fiction convention.
""The convention gives me a chance to talk to true bat lovers and people who havent experienced bats up close,"" DAngeli told
""Where else can you see a bat with a 3- to 4-foot wingspan in front of your face?""
A reputation refers to the way people think of something. But DAngeli says there is a lot to like about the
(active at night) animals. Bats, for example, help the environment. ""Many valuable bat species eat cropdamaging insects,"" he says.
DAngeli has been studying bats since he was a teenager. Whats his advice for students interested in studying the winged creatures? ""Get some rest. Youre going to be up late if you want to study bats.""
There are more than 900 known species of bats.
A brown bat can eat as many as 1,000 mosquitoes in an hour.
Contrary to popular belief, bats are not blind. To navigate in the dark, some bats use echolocation. That is a process in which sound waves bounce off objects and return to the bats ears.

227,"The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
What are some ways to prevent wildfires?
Few plants or animals live on the icy mountaintops in southern Argentina and Chile. The region is cold, desolate, and snowy.
The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

216,"Central Florida cleans up after the first tornadoes of 2007.
The windy season in Florida began in a big way. Residents of four counties are recovering after a series of destructive
ripped through central Florida, killing 20 people, damaging hundreds of homes, and cutting off power to more than 20,000 people. A tornado is a powerful, rotating tube of air that runs from the ground to a thundercloud. The recent tornado was so strong that it lifted a moving tractor-trailer off the ground and dropped it onto another truck. Fortunately, neither driver was seriously hurt. The drivers did, however, find out how powerful a tornado can be!
Tunnel of Fury: How A Tornado Forms
The strongest tornadoes develop from powerful, large-scale thunderstorms called
. The Florida tornadoes were created by supercell storms.
 Supercells are created when fronts of warm, moist air collide with cold, dry air.
 The opposing warm and cold gusts of air create a rotating column of rising wind called a
 When the funnelshaped cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
During the recent Florida tornadoes, winds reached speeds of more than 150 miles per hour. The storms were rated EF-3 on the
Scientists use the scale to measure the size and strength of tornadoes. The scale ranges from EF-0, the weakest, and EF-5, the strongest (with winds of more than 200 miles per hour).
Average number of tornadoes reported each year in the United States:
Length of damage trail a tornado can leave: up to
Tornado time span: up to one hour, but most tornadoes last less than

571,"Egyptians used papyrus, a tall plant, for paper.
the first paper was made in China.
Muslims in the Middle East learned the Chinese art of papermaking.
the first paper mill in Europe was built in Spain.
the first paper mill in the United States was built in Pennsylvania.
What shakes, pops, cracks, crumbles, tears, puckers, slaps, whistles, and sings? Give up? Those are just some of the many sounds that people can make with paper.
In mid-October, fifth graders watched as rolls of paper were released from the ceiling at the new Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Waving the paper, tapping on it, or blowing on it were some of the many ways musicians made sounds.
The paper instruments were part of a special performance called
. Chinese composer Tan Dun wrote the piece. He also invented and made the paper instruments used in the performance.
Dun's piece honors the art of papermaking and pays tribute to his Chinese heritage. Paper as we know it today was invented about 2,000 years ago in China.
The paper instruments allowed schoolchildren to hear how the shape of the concert hall affects sound. One 10-year-old girl from Los Angeles said that the concert hall sounded ""like a giant stereo.""
Dun says that the performance shows children that music can come from everyday objects. ""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper,"" Dun told

248,"Weekend meals for thousands of hungry U.S. children
Each Friday, 8-year-old Cody Lozano and his older sister, Cherokee, 9, carry heavy backpacks home from school. Their backpacks are not stuffed with books and supplies. Instead, they are loaded with nutritious food.
The two siblings are members of the BackPack club at Douglas Elementary School in Tyler, Texas. Before they head home on Fridays, students in the club are given backpacks stuffed with donated food for the weekend. The goal of the program is to help kids who face hunger. ""This BackPack club is great for Cherokee and Cody,"" their mother, Karen Lozano, told
""The kids dont have to go hungry.""
Cody and Cherokee are among the nearly 14 million children in the United States whose families dont have enough money to buy food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Free school meal programs help some of those kids during the week, but they still need to eat on the weekends.
Thats where the BackPack program lends a hand. ""We purchase the backpacks and the food, and volunteers [stuff] the backpacks and distribute them,"" says Robert Bush, the executive director of the East Texas Food Bank in Tyler. BackPack programs operate in 39 states to help thousands of hungry children.
Although the BackPack program is one way to help, people are looking for solutions to end
(Poverty is the state of being poor.) About 38 million Americans go hungry each year, and many of those are children. With Thanksgiving around the corner, many people will be thinking about what they can do to help.
of U.S. families cant afford enough food to eat.
children in the United States lives in poverty.

336,"On her TV show, Judge Judy Sheindlin makes difficult decisions concerning the cases she hears. Now the judge has written a book that aims to help kids make tough decisions.
You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover
, the judge presents situations that kids might find themselves in at school. She then offers some solutions but lets kids make their own decisions.
talked with Judge Judy. Here is what she had to say about her TV show and her book.
: How did you come up with the situations in your book?
Judge Judy: I developed them from real-life situations. I'm a grandmother. I asked my grandkids about the situations. I also tried to relate to kids and let them know that what they do now will affect them in their adult lives. This advice will, I hope, help them make the right choices.
: Compared to the past, are things different for kids today?
: Today, we live in a society that has both parents working. Working parents don't always spend enough time with their kids. Kids need parents who talk to them.
: How did you come up with the title for your book?
: Titles say a lot. You can't judge life by its cover. You shouldn't judge people by their covers--how they look or how they dress. You wouldn't want people to do that to you.
: What's the one piece of advice you would give to fourth graders?
: You should always think about what the right thing to do is--not what feels good, not what your friends are doing. If you think about what the right thing to do is, then eventually the right thing happens, and you sleep better at night.
: Your dog is pictured on the cover of your book. What's its name?

280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

196,"Calling all kids! LEGO Systems wants children to dig into their toy chests and donate some of those famous toy bricks. The company will collect the bricks and make a brick-for-brick matching donation to schools in New Orleans, Louisiana. The city continues to recover from Hurricane Katrina.
Some of the LEGO bricks will be used to construct a large model of a rebuilt New Orleans as imagined by kids across the country. The sculpture will be donated to the city as artwork. LEGO bricks will be collected through August 15, 2006. Each child who makes a donation will receive a LEGO-studded rubber bracelet.

516,"What's your favorite kind of soup? Some people like tomato soup, some like vegetable soup, others like chicken soup, and still others like New England clam chowder. According to a recent study, your favorite soup tells a lot about you.
Brian Wansink, a professor at the University of Illinois, recently asked people what their favorite soup is. He then asked the same people to describe their personalities. Here's what he learned about people who like soup:
People who like chicken noodle soup have a great sense of humor and watch a lot of TV.
People who like tomato soup love to read and like a variety of pets.
People who like minestrone soup like to try new foods at fancy restaurants.

42,"The bus that Rosa Parks made famous has been restored, or fixed, to look the way it did on December 1, 1955. It is on exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.
""This is a piece of history,"" said Bruce Danks, who worked on the bus.
On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress, boarded the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on her way home from work. Refusing to give up her seat to a white man, Rosa Parks was arrested and sent to jail.
Her arrest sparked the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. A boycott is a protest in which people refuse to
buy, sell, or use something. As part of the boycott, African Americans refused to ride buses in Montgomery if they couldn't sit in the front.
The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for over a year. In December 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to segregate, or separate, whites from African Americans on buses.
An ordinary woman who made an extraordinary difference, Rosa Parks is often referred to as ""the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement."" She inspired a new era of civil rights in the United States.

276,"Scientists have given new meaning to the words ""jet speed."" In early March, a NASA jet set a new record for speed.
The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at

769,"Police officers in several towns in Massachusetts are pulling drivers over and giving them presents.
The officers have started Buckle Up for Bucks, a program that rewards people who wear their seat belts. Officers reward people who wear seat belts by handing out doughnuts and raffle tickets for savings bonds.
""It works,"" said police officer John Janulewicz. ""If we can get them [people] in the habit of buckling up, it will reduce injuries."" The police say the number of people who wear seat belts has gone up by 10 percent.

726,"U.N. Day this year will focus on literacy.
Did you know that more than 113 million kids around the world do not go to school? Most of those children do not know how to read.
The United Nations (U.N.) is working to solve that problem. The U.N. is an organization made up of countries around the world. The countries work to promote world peace and to better the lives of poor people, including children.
The U.N. was formed on October 24, 1945. Each year, the U.S. president asks people to observe this anniversary as U.N. Day. This October, the day will be focused on
, which is the ability to read and write.
Many communities around the world will celebrate U.N. Day. Some schools will participate in special projects to draw attention to improving reading skills.
To do our part for this special day,
has donated 800 children's books to a literacy organization in Darien, Connecticut. Called the Book Aid Plan, this group is run by volunteers. They help put books in the hands of people in need around the world.
Book Aid receives letters from people who are setting up schools and libraries in poor areas of the United States as well as in countries as far away as Romania, Thailand, and China.
The organization gets the most requests for children's books. Based on the letters they receive, the volunteers at Book Aid decide which books to send and then pack the boxes.
This year, they will ship more than 50,000 pounds of books to almost 100 different countries. ""We may think a shipment is small, but we'll hear from volunteers saying we tripled the size of their library,"" said Barbara Gardner, the president of Book Aid.

433,"In wartime, U.S. Navy ships face many dangers. As the ships cruise at top speeds through the ocean, one of the deadliest threats is from underwater bombs called
. Ships use special sensors to locate mines.
Within the next few months, that same technology will be used to protect something a lot smaller and slower--manatees.
In the winter, West Indian manatees are found in many of the warm, shallow waters around Florida.
. A lock is an area of water in a canal enclosed by a set of gates at each end. The gates open to allow a ship to enter. The lock then fills with water to raise the ship or drains water to lower it. A lock allows a ship to move from one elevation to another.
Canal locks, however, can be deadly traps for manatees. An average of ten manatees a year have been killed in the gates in the past decade.
A little more than a year ago, the canal lock at Port Canaveral, Florida, was fitted with sensors like those used by the U.S. Navy to detect underwater mines.
The sensors work using sound waves, said Larry Taylor, the engineer overseeing the project. ""When the canal lock sensors [detect] a manatee, they stop the doors from closing,"" said Taylor.
Within a few weeks after the Port Canaveral installation, the sensors had saved seven manatees, Taylor said. He said there are plans to install the sensors at seven more Florida canal locks. ""This is a great system that will really help the manatees,"" Taylor recently told

627,"How hard will the flu hit this season? U.S. health officials aren't sure, but they fear the number of cases may be higher than usual.
There has been a shortage of flu
this year. A flu vaccine is a substance that helps fight the flu. Most people get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Others get it in the form of nose sprays.
This year, only two companies made flu vaccine for the United States. One of the two companies found that its supply, which was being made in England, was damaged. That company was supposed to provide the United States with half of the 100 million doses of flu vaccine expected.
. A virus is a tiny organism that makes people sick when it invades cells in the body and multiplies.
Flu season typically runs from November through March. Fever, a cough, a headache, and muscle aches are among the flu's many signs, or
There isn't a cure for the flu. Yet health officials say that the flu vaccine can help keep people from catching the bug. Scientists have to create a new flu vaccine each year. That is because the
, or type, of flu virus changes from year to year.
Due to the shortage of flu vaccine, the people at highest risk will get a flu shot first.
Because of the shortage, the people at highest risk will get the vaccine first. That group includes adults 65 and over, kids 6 to 23 months, and people with serious medical conditions. The vaccine was sent to doctors' offices that care for high-risk patients.
Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading:
Wash hands regularly with soap and warm water.
Use a tissue to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. If there isn't a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Using your hand may spread the germs.

415,"Thunder provides a wake-up call to head indoors.
""When thunder roars, go indoors,"" says meteroologist Ron Holle.
Scientists say lightning strikes the surface of Earth about 100 times each second. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring and summer. During those seasons, experts warn people to be especially aware of the dangers of lightning.
is the flash of light that occurs when electricity moves between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The huge spark of electricity is like the tiny kind you get when you run a comb through your hair or scuff your feet on a carpetonly much stronger.
A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as
Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told
, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A
Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoorsthe storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles.
Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning.
To stay safe, follow the golden rulehead for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe placesinside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle.""
Lightning expert Ron Holle shared the following tips with
Find shelter in a building or a metal-topped vehicle (not a convertible), and close the windows.
If you're caught outdoors, stay away from open spaces and avoid standing near tall objects, such as trees.
Avoid using electrical equipment, such as computers, TVs, and phones. (Cell phones are safe to use.)
Stay away from sinks and showers. Lightning can travel through water pipes.
Wait 30 minutes after the last sound of thunder or flash of lightning before going outside.

534,"The U.S. Supreme Court has a new chief justiceJohn Roberts. What effect will this new face have on the changing court?
How do changes taking place in the Supreme Court affect the lives of all Americans?
States is now in sessionwith a brand-new leader. John G. Roberts Jr. was recently sworn in as the 17th chief justice.
The Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. The Court is made up of nine judgeseight associate justices and one chief justice. Justices are appointed for life. The retirement or death of a justice can create an opening on the Supreme Court.
or chose, Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, the first woman justice, had announced in July that she would retire. But on September 3, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died.
Bush then asked the Senate to consider Roberts for the chief justice position. The chief justice is considered the justice with the most influence on the Court.
""One of the most [important] decisions a president makes is his appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court,"" said Bush in his announcement of Roberts's nomination. ""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American.""
At press time, the president had nominated Harriet Miers to take over O'Connor's position. If Miers is confirmed, she will be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court, after O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
John Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 27, 1955. In high school, he was captain of his football team. He also wrestled, sang in the choir, and edited the school newspaper. After graduating from law school, he assisted then Associate Justice Rehnquist. He is married to a lawyer and has two childrenJosie, 5, and Jack, 4.
The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heads the judicial branch, one of three branches of the U.S. government. The other two branches are the legislative branch and the executive branch. Each branch has a different job.
The authors of the Constitution created the three branches to ensure that no branch had too much power. That system is called
The legislative branch makes laws. That branch is also called Congress and is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch carries out laws made by Congress. That branch is headed by the president. The judicial branch
or explains, the laws. Many courts across the nation make up the judicial branch.
A case makes its way to the Supreme Court through lower courts. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn rulings made in lower courts. Once the Supreme Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All lower courts must follow its decision in similar cases.
How does a person become a Supreme Court justice?
1. The president nominates a person to serve as a justice.
2. A group of senators, called the Senate Judiciary Committee, asks the nominee his or her opinions about various laws and cases.
3. The Judiciary Committee votes on the nominee.
4. If the nominee is approved by the Judiciary Committee, all 100 U.S. senators vote. (There are two senators for each state.)
5. A nominee is confirmed if he or she receives 51 votes. Roberts was confirmed by a Senate vote of 78 to 22.
Roberts is the youngest chief justice since John Marshall led the Supreme Court more than 200 years ago. At age 50, Roberts is likely to be chief justice for a very long time. The chief justice decides which cases the Court will hear. In many cases, the chief justice speaks first and leads the debate.
During his swearing-in ceremony, Roberts said to President Bush, ""There is no way to repay the confidence you have shown in me other than to do the best job I possibly can do, and I'll try to do that every day.""
Do you think Supreme Court justices should be appointed for life? Why or why not?

367,"The number of collisions between powerboats and manatees has been on the rise since 1976, according to the Save the Manatee Club. In that time, close to 1,000 manatees have died from collisions with powerboats. Thousands of others have been injured. In 2000, collisions caused 38 percent of manatee deaths in Florida.
To curb those collisions, Florida has already passed laws that limit a boat's speed to under 10 miles per hour in areas where manatees are found. Now, police are beefing up patrols and cracking down on waterway speeders.

765,"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs.
Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

418,"These fourth graders are switching classes like middle schoolers!
Some fourth and fifth graders are on the move. The students at Ottawa Elementary School in Buchanan, Michigan, are getting a sneak preview of middle school life. Theyre switching classesand teachersfour times a day.
So far, the program has been a big hit. ""The kids really like that theyre going to get up and move every 40 minutes,"" science teacher Sue Borr told
""They dont like sitting in the same place all day.""
Borr suggested the program, which is called team teaching. Instead of staying with one teacher all day, students go to four different classrooms, where they learn four different subjects. Those subjects are math, social studies, science, and language arts. The students begin and end the day with a homeroom teacher.
""I like it better because the teachers like what theyre teaching,"" says Ottawa fifth grader Michael Meersman. ""They have fun, and theyre not as grouchy.""
Unlike many elementary school students, these fourth and fifth graders dont leave their papers and supplies in a desk. They carry their work with them from class to class in three-ring binders and colored folders. ""Theyre really organized,"" adds Borr.
Fourth graders at Ottawa have another reason to like the program: They wont have to get used to a new teacher when school starts next September, because they will learn the same subjects from the same teachers.

646,"Recently, Judy Leden strapped a pair of wings on her back. Then she ran as fast as she could down a hill. As she ran, the wings slowly lifted Leden off the ground. Soon she was soaring through the sky.
The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A glider based on drawings made by Leonardo da Vinci recently flew.
Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance.
A glider does not have an engine.
Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds.
No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

359,"Many Americans are flying and hanging the flag today. U.S. law and custom tell us how the flag should be displayed. For example, a flag should never touch the ground andcshould not be flown at night unless it is illuminated. Here are some other rules governing how the flag should be displayed.
The flag can be displayed vertically or horizontally. The union, or blue corner, should be displayed to the upper left of an observer.
The flag should be placed to the right of the speaker. Other flags should be placed to the left.
When a flag is suspended over a street, it should hang with the stars to the north or east.
The flag should be flown at half-staff only during periods of official morning. The flag should be raised to the top of its pole and then lowered to half-staff. At the end of the day, when the flag is lowered, it should be raised to the top before it is lowered.
The American flag should fly above a state flag.
When the American flag is flown with other national flags, the other flags should be of equal size and flown on separate polls at the same height as the American flag.

209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

1,"If you want to see the biggest ball of twine, the largest doughnut, the largest model elephant, or just about any other wacky thing, you have to take a road trip.
America's roads are lined with some of the wackiest attractions you will ever see. The earliest roadside attractions opened at about the time people bought the first cars.
Today, more people than ever are hitting the road and traveling by car. Many of those people are parking their cars in front of bizarre roadside attractions.
If one of the attractions doesn't meet your expectations as the biggest, longest, tallest, or best something, just drive a little farther.
What are some of these wacky wonders? If you are ever in Cawker City, Kansas, drop by to see the world's largest ball of twine. The ball is made of 7 million feet of twine and weighs 17,320 pounds. And it's still growing.
If you're tired of riding in the car, you might want to stop in Holbrook, Arizona. There, you can sleep in a motel room shaped like a teepee.
After a restful night in a teepee, you could go to Margate, New Jersey. There, you'll find Lucy the Elephant. Lucy isn't just any old elephant. She's a six-story-high model of an elephant that was built in 1881.
So don't miss out on the wacky fun. Take a road trip with your family, and see what amazingly strange things you can find along the roadside.

72,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

314,"Lighten Up! Most students carry too much weight in their backpacks.
A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

225,"Why is one of America's most historic areas endangered?
One of the most historic regions in the United States is in trouble. The 175-mile-long area of land stretches through Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The area is home to more American history than any other slice of land in the country, according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. George Washington built his estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison also built their homes in that state. The region at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains includes many battlefields from the Civil War (18611865).
As people construct new houses, roads, and buildings, they are destroying acres of history. Officials say the region has lost more than 150,000 acres of farmland in the past 20 years. That is an area slightly smaller than New York City.
To call attention to the problem, the Trust placed this region on the 2005 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The trust works to
""This is where the Civil War was fought,"" says Richard Moe, president of the trust. ""This is where our Founding Fathers lived. ... There are African American sites. There are Native American sites. Our whole nation's history is, in one way or the other, [in this area].""
The following places are in the region between Pennsylvania and Virginia that was added to this year's list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States.
In 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle was the turning point of the Civil War.
Monticello was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States.

789,"Richard Rodriguez recently set a new world's record for riding a roller coaster. He rode a coaster for 2,000 bone-rattling hours. That's about 22,655 miles.
To set the record, Rodriguez (front) rode a roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, an amusement park in England, for 22 hours a day for 90 days. After setting the record, Rodriguez said, ""It was a small step for me, but a giant roller coaster ride for mankind.""
Setting records for riding roller coasters isn't new to Rodriguez. He set his first record in 1977, when he rode a coaster for 103 hours and 55 minutes. He has broken that record many times in the last 23 years.

219,"Have you ever closed your eyes and tried to walk from one end of a room to the other? It's hard. Now, imagine running a race with your eyes closed. That's similar to what running is like for Maria Runyan.
Runyan, age 31, is legally blind. She is the first legally blind athlete to qualify for a U.S. Olympic team. She is competing in the 1,500-meter running race in Sydney.
Runyan has had Stargardt's disease since she was 9 years old. As a result of that disease, Runyan can't see much of anything in the center of her vision.
""I never said I wanted to be the first legally blind runner to make the Olympics,"" Runyan said after making the team. ""I just wanted to be an Olympian. I don't ever see my vision as a barrier.""

422,"Toy companies are always looking for the latest toy craze. One toy maker thinks it has a jump on the competition. It has just come out with a high tech pogo stick called the Airgo.
Unlike other pogo sticks, the Airgo doesn't have squeaky springs that help kids jump up and down. Instead, it has an air pump that will give users some extra lift.
According to an official at Razor USA, which makes the toy, the newly designed pogo stick is ""really cool looking"". It has adjustable handlebars and folds down to 22 inches.
Even though the Airgo may be cool looking, safety experts say that users should always wear helmets and knee and elbow pads.

528,"Steroid scandal blocks slugger from Hall of Fame.
Two star athletes will join the National Baseball Hall of Fame this summerCal Ripken Jr. and Tony Gwynn. Former St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, however, will have to wait for admission.
McGwire didn't come close to receiving the 75 percent of the votes required for a player to be elected. This is the first year McGwire was
or qualified, for the honor. (To be on the ballot, an athlete must be retired for at least five years.)
when he broke a major-league record with 70 home runs in the 1998 season. Steroids are drugs that build up muscles to increase strength. During his career, McGwire hit 583 home runs, the seventh highest of all time. Before joining the Cardinals, he played first base for the Oakland Athletics.
Retired Baltimore Orioles shortstop Ripken and San Diego Padres outfielder Gwynn have never been suspected of using steroids. They are admired by many baseball fans for their fairness and honesty. Both played their entire careers on one team (see ""
""). In July, the pair will be
or admitted, into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.
McGwire has never openly admitted to steroid use. However, during a hearing before the U.S. Congress in 2005, he did not deny using the muscle-building drugs. That testimony has led many people to believe that McGwire did use steroids. In 2002, Major League Baseball banned the use of the drugs, which are
After learning he was not voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, McGwire defended his baseball career. ""I had an absolutely wonderful career that I'm very proud of,"" he told the
newspaper of California State University, Fullerton. McGwire added that he wasn't in control of getting into the Hall of Fame. ""I was in control of hitting the ball.""
Check out the stats for the two newest members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Ripken grew up near Baltimore, Maryland, where he played pro baseball throughout his 21-year career. He was a two-time American League Most Valuable Player and set a record for playing the most games in a row: 2,632.
Gwynn grew up in California, where he played basketball and baseball. He decided to play baseball professionally and became one of the sport's best hitters. During his 20-year career, he led the National League in batting average eight times.

369,"For many years, parents in Honduras have been giving their children unusual first names. Some parents in the Central American country have given their children such names as Bujia, which means ""Spark Plug,"" or Llanta de Milagro, which means ""Miracle Tire."" Other parents have named their children after famous American presidents. For example, one kid's first name is Bill Clinton, and another kid's name is Ronald Reagan.
Now, a government committee in Honduras wants parents to stop giving their children such unusual names. The committee worries that some kids could tease those kids with uncommon names.

391,"Michelle Wie has gone pro! She is the fourth woman and the youngest person ever to play on the Professional Golf Association tour. Just days before her 16th birthday, she announced her decision to become a pro golfer.
Michelle was born in Hawaii and began playing golf at the age of 4. She practiced at least three hours a day after school and seven to eight hours on weekends.
The following professional women golfers have won the most major championships. Who knows how Michelle might eventually stack up?

402,"Its the holiday season, and shoppers have Elmo-mania once again. The furry red monster from
is flying off toy-store shelves. T.M.X. Elmo is expected to be the hottest toy of the year. The latest Elmo doll was created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, which caused a craze when it was introduced in 1996. When tickled, T.M.X.

Teachers from around the United States have been working at McDonald's restaurants for a day. The teachers are taking part in McDonald's McEducation program.
First, the teachers learn how to use the cash registers. Then they take orders from customers. McDonald's donates 20 percent of the sales made by the teachers to schools. The money is used to buy library books.
The McEducation program helps schools and gives students a chance to see their teachers outside of school. ""It's really funny because they are teachers, and they don't look like they belong here,"" said one student from New Haven, Connecticut, after seeing his teachers working in a McDonald's restaurant.

766,"People in some states pay a deposit when they buy bottles and cans of soft drinks. When they return the empty bottles and cans to a redemption center, they get their deposits back. Now some lawmakers in Maine want people to pay a 5-cent deposit on each cigarette they buy. If the bill passes, people could return used cigarette butts to get a deposit back.
The lawmakers who introduced the bill say they did so for two reasons. First, such a plan would lead to fewer crushed cigarette butts littering the landscape. ""I think [the law] could work to reduce waste,"" said Maine lawmaker Scott Cowger, who cosponsored the bill in Maine's House of Representatives.
Second, a cigarette deposit law would raise money for antismoking education programs in Maine schools. The bill's sponsors admit they expect only a small percentage of people will redeem cigarette butts. But those nickel deposits that aren't redeemed could add up to as much as $50 million for school antismoking programs.
Some people in Maine have problems with the cigarette deposit bill. Annie Loadwick, of Mercer, Maine, runs a bottle and can redemption center. She said she doesn't want to have to handle and count customer's used cigarette butts.
Maine's governor, Angus King, also does not support the bill. He wants instead to place a tax on cigarettes of 26 cents per pack. The tax, King said, would produce up to $36 million for school antismoking programs.

93,"Scientists have snapped brilliant new photos of the Crab Nebula.
Scientists have finally ""seen the light.""A space telescope snapped a spectacular photo of the Crab Nebula. A
is a huge cloud of gas and dust in deep space. A very large star exploded in the universe more than a thousand years ago and formed the nebula.
We are seeing the light only now because the Crab Nebula is located 6,500
away from Earth. A light-year measures distance, not time. One light-year is equal to nearly 6 trillion miles. When we see the light of distant objects in the universe, like the Crab Nebula, we are seeing the light they gave off a long time ago.

155,"Report Points to Mice As Asthma Cause
17 million Americans suffer from asthma. About 5 million kids suffer from asthma.
Each year, more than 3 million kids visit the doctor's office because of asthma attacks.
When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have
, a disease that makes it hard to breathe.
For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat
, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander.
Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander.
The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids.
As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks].""
Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past.
Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor.
To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year.
Many kids who suffer from asthma might be able to breathe more easily if they could find ways to keep the dander of mice, cats, and other kinds of animals out of their homes.

79,"Floodwater recently exploded from Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona. The water gushed down the Colorado River and into the Grand Canyon. A
is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side.
Scientists released water from the dam to move 1 million tons of
down the Colorado River. Sediment is sand and soil carried by water. Scientists hope the sediment will collect on beaches and
to save endangered fish and plants. Sandbars are ridges of sand formed by moving water.
Glen Canyon Dam is a wall that people built across the Colorado River. It was made to store water and generate electricity. When it began operating in 1963, it stopped the flow of river water and most of the sediment.
Glen Canyon Dam is located in Arizona.
Without new sediment, beaches and sandbars started washing away. Plants growing along the beaches began to die off. Many young fish that depend on sandbars to survive started to die off too.
During the next two years, scientists will study the effects of the flooding. ""The Grand Canyon is one of the unique natural areas in the world,"" scientist Denny Fenn told
. ""It deserves protection. Anything we can do to save it, the better off we'll be.""

347,"Popcorn is the official state snack food of Illinois.
Its light. Its fluffy. It pops. What is it? Popcorn! And now, it is also the official state snack food of Illinois.
The idea to honor popcorn came from a group of second and third graders. They called themselves the ""Kernel Kids.""
The kids invited a state senator to their school to tell him about their idea. The senator thought it was good and told other officials about the idea. In August, the governor of Illinois signed the popcorn bill. At the ceremony, the guests ate popcorn. The students wore popcorn hats that they had made.

702,"Each year, a special award is given to a person or group of people who work for peace. The award is called the Nobel Peace Prize. The first peace prize was given more than 100 years ago. This year, Jimmy Carter, a former U.S. president, won the award.
Carter was president from 1977 to 1981. Later, he founded the Carter Center. The former president works with the Carter Center to bring about peace and to help poor people all over the world.
The Nobel Peace Prize comes with 1 million dollars. ""The money will almost all go to the Carter Center,"" said Carter.

3,"A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr. 
On January 17, Americans will celebrate the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr.
""A day on, not a day off!"" Since 1994, that has been the slogan for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Many students have the holiday off from school. Kids at Greene Street Friends School in Pennsylvania, however, will make it ""a day on.""
The kids will sew quilts for needy infants and pack meals for elderly people. ""I like that I'm helping people,"" 10-year-old Justine Baird told
The students at Greene Street Friends School are among the thousands of kids across the country who will take part in community service projects. The projects honor King's memory.
A Look Back at a Leader: Martin Luther King Jr.
Delivered the ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C.
Martin Luther King Jr. Day first observed as a national holiday
King was an African American leader who devoted his life to improving the lives of others. He once said, ""Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve.""
When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote.
Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work,

710,"Some kids who want to play tag are out of luck. The game has been
at Willet and McCarthy elementary schools in Massachusetts. (
means ""not allowed."") Those students are not alone. A growing number of schools across the country have put an end to the playground game.
Recess is safer without tag, say some school officials. At Freedom Elementary School in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the game often led to pushing and fighting. ""To be safe, [all students] must keep their hands and feet to themselves,"" the principal, Cindy Farwell, told
Others think banning tag goes too far. ""It's telling children we don't trust them to be safe when they play games,"" says Rhonda Clements. She teaches physical education at a college in New York. Clements also says kids should be able to choose whom they play with and what they play.

318,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.

548,"Why are so many frog species disappearing?
Why did dozens of harlequin frog species start vanishing 20 years ago? Scientists studying the brightly colored frogs might have solved the mystery. The experts blame a skin
for causing the frogs to die off. A fungus is a form of plant life that can cause disease in animals.
Harlequin frogs are not the only creatures in danger of dying out because of the disease. ""This fungus is killing amphibians all over the world,"" scientist Cynthia Carey told
is an animal with a backbone that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians. They are
which means their body temperature depends on their environment.
Scientists are working to save the worlds amphibians. Many of these creatures have already become
or died out completely. Disease is not the only danger for amphibians. Their habitat is being destroyed as people cut down trees in the areas where the animals live. Hunting, pollution, and weather changes are also contributing to the problem.
Is there any good news for frogs and other amphibians? The new findings will lead to more research, says Carey. The research could help scientists save the remaining animals before the fungus spreads. ""Weve identified the disease and how it works,"" scientist Karen Lips told
""Now we can try to stop it.""

339,"A rover like this one is making its way across the surface of Mars in search of life.
Is there life on Mars? Was there once life on Mars? People have been trying to answer those questions for years. Since 1960, scientists have sent spacecraft to explore the Red Planet.
NASA* recently launched two rovers into space. Scientists chose the launch date carefully. In August, Mars and Earth were closer than at any time in the past 60,000 years.
The rovers are on a mission. They are looking for signs that water once existed on Mars. Scientists say that water is the key to life. If they find evidence of water, that could mean there was once life on Mars.
The rovers each have a parachute and an airbag to help them bounce to a safe landing. Once the rovers land, they will drill into rocks and take photos of them. Then, the rovers will send the photos back to Earth.
Distance from Earth on August 27, 2003:
Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in our solar system. Mars has mountains, valleys, and ice caps. It also has seasons.
Scientists are hoping the rovers will provide clues to the Red Planet's past. The mission may also give scientists clues to Earth's future. ""We think Mars used to be more like Earth,"" said one scientist. ""Now look at it: It's harsh and cold. We know Earth is changing; this might help us understand how it has changed, and will [change] in the future.""
The names of the rovers are Spirit and Opportunuty. They were named by 9 year old Sofi Collis of Arizona. She was the winner of a rover naming contest.

138,"Spiders may not like to eat sweet treats, but they sure know some tricks! Scientists recently learned that certain spiders build
of themselves. A decoy is something used to trick or trap something or someone.
The spiders live in Taiwan. That is part of China, which is a country in Asia. The spiders build the decoys in their webs. They make the fake crawlers to protect themselves from wasps. The spiders use dead insects and other materials to make the decoys. The decoys are about the same size and shape as the spiders.
Spiders may be the only creatures other than humans to make life-size models of their own bodies, according to researchers. Our study seems to be the first to [show] animal-made decoys, scientist I-Min Tso told reporters.
The spiders plan to trick wasps works, researchers say. The insects often think the decoys are real. When wasps attack the fake spiders, the real critters quickly crawl away.
Not even Spider-Man could come up with such a great escape!

456,"A new report shows more people are online than ever before.
Everyone who is online, please stand up! What if that message could be heard all over the world at the same time? How many people do you think would stand up?
The answer is nearly 2 billion. That is how many people worldwide are expected to be on the
by the end of this year. The Internet is a communications system. It connects computers around the world. Today, nearly one-third of all human beings use the Internet.
Children in Asia learn how to use the Internet in class.
Those figures are from a new report by an international technology
An agency is an organization. Since 2005, the number of people in the world with Internet
has doubled. To have access to something is to have the ability to use it.
Most of those people live in richer nations. However, the report shows that the number of Internet users in poorer countries is on the rise. Of the 226 million new users in 2010, about 160 million are from poorer nations.
Until recently, many people in those countries didnt have computers. Increasing Internet use is bringing the world together, expert Toshie Takahashi told
Kids are more connected too. Young people can play games and do homework on the Internet, Takahashi explains. They can even communicate with kids on the other side of the globe.
For kids, the Internet has shrunk the world, she says. It doesnt seem like such a big place anymore.
Ever wonder how the Internet began? Browse through the time line to learn about some major moments in the Internets history.

669,"In the future, a fly on the wall may really be a robot! Scientists in California are developing a tiny flying robot. The flying robot is so small that scientists have to pick it up with tweezers.
Scientists are modeling the robot after a fly. They say flies are amazing insects. Flies can land upside down on the ceiling. They can fly backward. Flies can even turn faster than fighter jets!
Scientists say the flying robot will have many uses. For example, a tiny camera could be placed on the robot. Soldiers could then use the robot to spy on enemy troops.

226,"A new glass walkway will allow visitors to step out over the Grand Canyon.
Brave visitors will soon have a birds-eye view of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. Plans are being made to build a glass walkway. It will jut out 70 feet from the canyons edge. Looking down, visitors will be able to see the Colorado River flowing 4,000 feet below.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. It is cut into the earth by running water. The Grand Canyon was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years.
If all goes as planned, the walkway will open in January. It is being built on land owned by a Native American tribe called the Hualapai. ""Its a whole new way to experience the Grand Canyon,"" says spokesperson Sheri Yellowhawk.

388,"Zooming down a hill, you feel the wind rushing in your face. Seconds later, you are hanging upside down! You are riding a roller coaster. But are you safe?
New roller coasters are getting bigger, faster, and scarier. Millions of kids and adults take these thrill rides each year. Some experts worry that the rides' sudden twists and turns are unsafe.
High-speed coasters whip riders' heads back and forth. One report blamed coasters for 13 brain injuries from 1995 to 2000. Another report says some people have nearly died from coaster-related brain injuries.
Recently, two scientists set out to learn if coasters really do cause brain injuries. They studied the effects of riding three of the fastest coasters in the United States. The scientists say the coasters' twists and turns are not fast enough to cause brain injuries.
""People take more than 1 billion rides on roller coasters each year. The reports on brain injury are few and not proven,"" said Douglas Smith. He is one of the scientists who did the new study.
Some experts do not think the new study proves coasters are safe-especially for kids. They say the scientists only studied how coasters affect adults, not kids. They want a new study.
Edward Markey is a government official. Recently, he asked a group of experts to include children in their next study about roller coaster safety. Results from that study will be reported next year. Roller coasters have to be studied to make sure that ""riders of all ages"" are safe, Markey said.
 The idea for the roller coaster began with the ice slide. It was invented in Russia more than 500 years ago.
 There are more than 1,400 roller coasters in the world today.

427,"The days of stinky feet are over. Gang Sun, a scientist, has invented a smell-free sock.
The sock's fibers are made with bits of
Chlorine is a chemical used to kill
Bacteria are tiny germs that you can see only with a microscope. Bacteria cause socks to smell. In the new socks, the chlorine kills any odor-causing bacteria.
A cross-country running team tested the socks. ""After running 9 miles, not having socks smell of feet is a real bonus,"" said one runner.

249,"You may see fewer bats flying around this Halloween. Thousands of them are dying in the northeastern United States. Experts dont know why.
. That is a sickness in which white mold-like patches grow on the bats noses, wings, and tails. It was first spotted on bats in New York in 2007. White-nose syndrome has since spread to bats in four other states.
Spooky! Could these bats white noses be making them sick?
, or strange, things. Bats like to fly at night. However, some of the sick bats have been seen taking wing in daylight.
Scientists are not sure whats killing the bats. They are on a mission to learn more. This fall they will journey into some of the bats caves. They will attach radio transmitters to many of the creatures. That will allow scientists to study their movements and body temperatures. They might learn why bats are dying.
Something is killing the bats, and we dont know what it is, scientist Susi von Oettingen told

204,"An eclipse of the moon is coming soon! A
will appear in the sky on December 10. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through Earths shadow. Earth blocks direct sunlight to the moon, and the moon becomes dark. That gives it a spooky glow. In North America, people will be able to see only part of the eclipse.
Who turned out the lights? The moon will darken in an eclipse.
The moon does not disappear completely during an eclipse. Instead, it may turn bright red or brown.
People can see an eclipse without a telescope. Its pretty cool, Noah Petro told
. He is a scientist at NASA. That is the U.S. space agency. If its [a] clear [night], you should be able to see it.

417,"The United States is sometimes called a ""melting pot."" It got this nickname because people from all over the world have come here to live. A recent government report says more people from Latin American and Asian countries are living in the United States than ever before.
The U.S. Census Bureau counts all the people who live in the United States every ten years.
The world map shows the areas where the most immigrants who live in the United States came from between 1990 and 1999, according to the Census Bureau.
The Census Bureau's report shows that about 11 million Asian people live in the United States today. The report also says that 31 million Latin American people live in the United States.
Latin American people are from the countries south of the United States in Central and South America. People
or move from their homeland to another country, for many reasons. Some people leave their homeland to be with family members. Other people emigrate because life in their homeland has become too hard or dangerous. More people also emigrate today because traveling to other countries is faster, less expensive, and safer than ever before.
The Census Bureau says that the main reason people emigrate to the United States to start a new life.

24,"Tourists can now see the Grand Canyon from a new angle. A glass walkway lets visitors step out over the canyon. The structure, which opened in March, is called the Grand Canyon Skywalk. It is shaped like a horseshoe and
or extends, 70 feet beyond the canyon's edge.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon, in Arizona, was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. Looking down from the skywalk, people can see the canyon floor 4,000 feet below.
The Hualapai (WAH-luh-pie) Indians, who live near the Grand Canyon National Park, allowed the structure to be built. Some tribe members hope the skywalk encourages tourists to visit the natural wonder. The glass walkway can hold the weight of a few hundred people, says architect Mark Johnson. Hualapai leaders and two former astronauts were the first people to set foot on the new skywalk.

174,"Pluto has recently been dropped as a planet from displays at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. Why? Because the museum's scientists had studied Pluto and decided it isn't a planet, for these reasons:
Pluto's orbit is unlike any other planet's in our solar system.
Pluto is small, even smaller than Earth's moon.
Many other scientists disagree and say Pluto should still be considered a planet.

493,"Hannah Nemiah and her friends once had long hair. Not anymore! This past spring, the 9-year-olds from Connecticut decided to chop off their hair and
it. To donate means to give to a charity. The charity they donated their hair to is called Locks of Love. It is a group that gives wigs to kids who have lost their hair because of illness.
The three girls heard about Locks of Love at school. ""I thought it would be nice to donate my hair,"" Hannah told
. Hannah's mother called a local salon. The owner helped out by giving the haircuts for free.
After they had their hair cut, the girls were all smiles. ""I think it's nice to help other people,"" said Gillian Kennedy.

in Washington, D.C. An exhibit is a show or display. This exhibit is called ""School House to White House."" It includes more than 150 items from U.S. presidents' school days.
There are lots of pictures, letters, and report cards on display. U.S. President Jimmy Carter had perfect attendance. George W. Bush made straight A's in first grade. His father, George H. W. Bush, also grew up to be president. He once got an F in science!

196,"A new food program helps kids cook up healthy habits.
If you are what you eat, then students at MacGregor Elementary School are fresh fruits and vegetables!
Kids at the school in Houston chow down on everything from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They grow all the food themselves in a school garden. Then they
the fruits and veggies and turn them into healthy meals. To harvest is to collect.
The students got their green thumbsand their appetites for fresh foodfrom the Recipe for Success Foundation. That group teaches kids about the food they eat. We make good food fun, says Gracie Cavnar, the groups founder.

 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called

606,"Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who!
The ivory-billed woodpecker has bird lovers cheering. They thought the bird was extinct. Now scientists say they have proof that the woodpecker still lives in Arkansas. They have a videotape of the bird in flight.
Why did the rare bird disappear? Between 1880 and the 1940s, loggers cut down the forests where the bird lived. The last sighting of the bird was in 1944.
The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the United States. Its call sounds like the toot of a tin horn. The bird is also known for its
or one-of-a-kind, tapping sound. It makes a double knock when its beak strikes a tree.
Some people didn't think the videotape was enough proof, so the scientists recorded the bird's double knock. The recording made believers out of everyone. Hear the bird's double knock at

146,"Imagine if boys made all the rules. That's how it was in 1776, when the United States was founded. Women were not allowed to vote until 1920! This year is the 85th anniversary of that important event.
Library of Congress, George Grantham Bain Collection
Thousands of women marched in New York City for the right to vote.
movement began in the 1800s. Suffrage is the right to vote. To win this right, women held protests and marches. Hundreds of those women were arrested and jailed.
Women's groups across the country are honoring those who fought for this right with special events throughout the year. ""Learning how women's actions changed America is important.

717,"If two heads are better than one, Asimo robots are in luck. The robots were created by Honda Motor Co. Honda recently upgraded the robots so they can work in pairs. The
can share information with each other about what they are doing. A humanoid is a thing that has human qualities, such as being able to speak.
Recently, two Asimos worked together to serve drinks to people in Tokyo. That is a city in Japan. The robots' technology allows them to guess people's movements. That helps them avoid bumping into people.

698,"Who likes zoos? The Tavianos sure do! The family from Columbus, Ohio, (above) visited 52 zoos in one year!
Parents Marla and Gabe and their daughters, Olivia, Ava, and Nina, recently traveled across the country checking out animal
Their adventure began in August 2008. They visited a zoo in Kentucky first. The tour ended one year later. Their last trip was to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.
The Tavianos saw just about every animal imaginable. They fed pelicans, rode camels, and petted stingrays. They even got kisses from a giraffe! Olivia, 8, Ava, 7, and Nina, 3, say their favorite is the Saint Louis Zoo in Missouri. They have the coolest penguin and puffin exhibit, Ava told
The family has finished traveling for a while. They have big dreams for the future, though. I want to go around the world someday, says Olivia.

563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.

526,"What is colorful, plastic, and nearly 100 feet tall? The worlds tallest LEGO tower!
, or built, in Vienna, Austria. Austria is a country in Europe. The plastic creation broke the
world record for the tallest LEGO building. Something that is previous came before.
The tower was made up of about 460,000 LEGOs. More than 3,000 people helped build it in four days.
Most of the builders were children. Each young helper made a part of the tower. The designs were different, says LEGO spokesperson Kate Sutch. Some kids built their sections in patterns.
Breaking the record feels amazing, Sutch told

665,"Step aside, Spider-Man! Scientists recently invented a glue that works like geckos' feet. Geckos are little lizards that can scurry up walls. Their feet are lined with millions of tiny hairs that can
on to a surface. To latch is to grab. The new glue is made with millions of tiny plastic fibers. The fibers grab hold as they slide across things. Like gecko feet, the glue releases easily. It doesn't leave a sticky film behind either. Scientist Ron Fearing helped create the glue. He compares it to how a toothbrush works. ""If I tap [a toothbrush] lightly against a surface, a few bristles will make contact,"" he says. ""But if I rub the toothbrush across the surface, the bristles bend and make ... more contact.""

Fifteen-year-old Matthew Hector called on a crowd of20,000 people to fight world poverty. He was one of many people who spoke out at a recent
, or a large meeting, in London, England. ""We believe the world should be fair so that everyone has the same opportunity to ... have a good life,"" he said.
The rally launched a worldwide campaign called ""Make Poverty History."" The goal is to challenge world leaders to end poverty.
do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life. More than a billion people around the world are poor. About half of those people are children. Many of the poorest countries are in Africa.
One of the most famous speakers at the rally was Nelson Mandela. He is the former president of South Africa. Mandela urged people to help those in need. He said, ""While [there is poverty], there is no true freedom.""
Many of the world's poorest countries are in Africa.
If you wanted to inspire others to help poor countries, what would you say?
In his speech, Mandela challenged world leaders not to ""look the other way"" from the problem of poverty. In July, leaders of the eight wealthiest countries, including the United States, will meet in Scotland. They have promised to take action to end poverty. Mandela and other supporters of ""Make Poverty History"" hope that world leaders keep their promise.

730,"Adara Claphan (below) has a gift for music. Now shes sharing that gift with others. The fifth grader from Wichita, Kansas, is raising money to donate guitars to kids in Nicaragua. That is a country in Central America.
Adara began taking guitar lessons last year. Music is a part of life, she told
Recently, the music maker learned about a
called HeartStrings. A charity is an aid group. The organization raises money to send guitars to kids in countries where many people are poor, such as Nicaragua.
After hearing that, Adara came up with a plan to help. She began selling necklaces and earrings for $5 each. Before long, the student had raised enough money to donate her first guitar.

661,"Yuck! A health and safety group recently tested school surfaces for germs and found millions! Drinking fountains had the most germs. A cafeteria tray had more germs than a toilet seat! The testers also found germs lurking on desks and computer keyboards.
Health experts say drinking fountains would have fewer germs if they were cleaned more often.
Kids miss 22 million days of school each year because of colds caught from germs. That number would be much lower if kids would just wash their hands, say health experts.
Not all germs are harmful, but some can make kids sick. ""When you share things in a classroom, you increase the chance that you might get sick,"" the health and safety groups spokesperson, Jerry Bowman, told
""Since we are right in the middle of cold and flu season, we have to be extra careful to wash our hands and cover up [our] coughs.""

66,"Hundreds of butterflies will spend the winter in New York City. The butterflies will live in the American Museum of Natural History. The museum has a special room for the butterflies. There are trees, grass, and plants in the room.
Many of the butterflies are from warm rain forests in places like Africa and Asia. So the temperature in the butterfly room is kept at 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Powerful lamps shine down from the ceiling like the sun shines in a rain forest.
Visitors to the museum can walk along a pathway through the special room. The butterflies often land on the visitors. People get a close-up look at the butterflies.

180,"Do you ever wonder how plastic is recycled? Now you can see how it's done!
Workers take the plastic to a recycling plant. The plastic is washed, chopped, and dried. Then the pieces are heated until they melt. The melted plastic is pressed through a screen. Finally, the plastic is cooled in water.

229,"The map shows some volcanoes located in Mexico.
Popocatpetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States.
Late last year, a volcano called Popo erupted. Gases and ash filled the air. No one was hurt by the eruption. Scientists studying Popo knew it was going to erupt. About 50,000 people live in the villages and towns that surround Popo. The scientists warned those people. Many of the residents left their homes before the eruption.
Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that
, or melted rock, was rising inside the volcano.
During eruptions, magma can spill out of openings in volcanoes. The hot, flowing magma is called
when it is outside the volcano. When Popo erupted, only heat, gas, and ashes burst out.
After the eruption, the residents were able to return to their homes. But they are watching for future eruptions.
Lava and ash from volcanoes can harm people. What else might these substances harm?
Popo is almost 18,000 feet high. Last Year's eruption was its biggest in 1,200 years.
About 550 volcanoes have erupted on Earth's surface since people began recording history.
A volcano erupts somewhere on Earth about once a week. Not all eruptions are big, however.

474,"Sue has small holes in her jaw. For years, people have tried to find out why.

may have caused the holes. A parasite is a tiny creature that lives on another living thing.

336,"California Sea Lions live along the west coast of North America. The map shows the west coast of the U.S.
of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers.
San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!
Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out
Experts say the earthquake might have caused
, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore.
Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier.
Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds.
Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour.
Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.
Sea lions eat fish, squid, and octopus. They have about 36 teeth but like to swallow their food whole.
Storm drains in Oxnard, California, usually don't bark. But they do if there is a sea lion stuck inside!
Two kids called the police when they heard barking and saw a sea lion inside a
. (A storm drain is a large pipe that drains rainwater into a lake or ocean.) A rescue team used a large fishing net to free the sea lion. The team spent five hours bringing the 350-pound sea lion out through a manhole.
Rescue workers took the sea lion back to the Pacific Ocean in a truck. They say the sea lion was probably swimming in a local harbor when it entered the drain.

499,"Some places get wet weather during spring.
Grab your raincoat and boots! Spring is here. That means warmer, rainy weather in some parts of the United States. Read the answers to some questions about wet weather.
A few wet drops land on your head. Its raining! Rain falls from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny bits of water and ice. The bits grow bigger as they join together. Some get so heavy that they fall to the ground. The ice melts if the air is warmer along the way. The raindrops reach the ground as water.
. Those are storms with heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. As lightning strikes, it heats the air around it. That causes the air to
, or get bigger. When that happens, you hear a loud sound called thunder.
When it rains, you may see a rainbow. It appears when sunlight passes through drops of water in the air. The drops break up the sunlight into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Why? Sunlight is always made up of those colors. They look white when they are together. The drops of water separate each color.
Why might it be useful to learn about weather?

172,"Scientists recently made a surprising discovery. They found the remains of a giant penguin. It was about 5 feet tall! That is much larger than any penguin alive today. In fact, it is the third-largest bird known to have ever lived.
The giant penguin had a long, sharp beak. It was almost a foot long. The beak looked like a spear, say scientists. They think the penguin used it to catch fish.
The penguin lived in Peru about 36 million years ago. Peru is a country in South America.

148,"Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe!
In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

434,"What sounds do you hear right now? You may hear a fan blowing, kids talking, or a bell ringing. All the sounds you hear travel in waves. Those waves enter your outer ear. They travel through your middle ear and inner ear. Your inner ear sends a message to your brain. Then you hear sound. Study the ear below to learn more.
That means it moves quickly back and forth. When people speak, their vocal cords vibrate. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and makes sound.
Did you know that sounds can travel through solid materials? Try this experiment with a partner to find out. Place a plastic ruler on a table. Make sure one end is hanging over the edge. Hold the ruler down with one hand. Ask your partner to place his or her ear against the surface of the table. With your other hand, gently snap the end of the ruler that is hanging over the floor. What did you and your partner see, hear, and feel?

536,"A Grand View of the Grand Canyon
Soon visitors to the Grand Canyon in Arizona will be able to step out onto a glass walkway to get a better view of one of the world's most beautiful canyons.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon was cut into Earth over millions of years by the waters of the Colorado River.
The new walkway, called the Skywalk, is on the west
or edge, of the canyon. It juts out 70 feet. When it officially opens, visitors will be able to look down at deep rock formations.
The walkway was built on land owned by a Native American tribe called the Hualapai (WAH-luh-pigh). They want to attract more people to the west rim. ""It's a whole new way to experience the Grand Canyon,"" says spokesperson Sheri Yellowhawk.

396,"Your bones are still growing. Exercise helps build strong bones. Do all kinds of exercise build bones? No! That is what a recent study has found. Experts say

Millions of gallons of gas are being wasted!

37,"Have you ever wondered how snow forms? Bits of frozen water called
form in the air when it is very cold. Many ice crystals make a snowflake. A group of snowflakes creates a snowfall.
Before a snowflake reaches the ground, it goes through four steps.
1. Each snowflake begins as water droplets inside a cloud in the sky.
2. When the temperature freezes, the water droplets turn into ice crystals.
Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division.
3. As more water sticks to the ice crystal, it begins to change shape.
4. When many ice crystals stick together, snowflakes form and fall to the ground.
The shape of a snowflake depends on the temperature at which ice crystals form. These crystals bump into each other and stick together. That creates new shapes of snowflakes.
Snowflakes are usually less than half an inch across.
The largest snowflake ever measured was bigger than a childs hand!
Snow only looks white. It is actually clear.
No two snowflakes are exactly the same.
Can you name two things that look alike but are not exactly the same?

109,"Fire officials are alarmed. Some lighters are made to look like toys. Parents who think they are toys are buying them for their
children. Kids have started fires when playing with the lighters.
Now fire officials are fighting back. They want to stop the sale of those lighters. This year, Maine became the first state to pass a law to stop the sale of the lighters. Then Tennessee passed a law. Fire officials in Oregon are working to do the same.
Lighters are tools, not toys, says Richard Hoover. He is a spokesperson for the Oregon state fire marshal. A dangerous tool should not look like a toy.

236,"Our world is filled with wild and weird creatures. Scientists say that there are millions of creepy crawlers for each person on Earth. Take a look at some of those creatures.
Arachnids and insects are two types of creepy, crawling creatures.
(ah-RAK-nidz) have eight legs. Scorpions and spiders are arachnids.
have fangs and stingers. Some scorpions' skin can glow in certain types of light. Many scorpions live in deserts around the world.
are yellow. That helps them stay hidden. The spiders wait on the inside of flowers. They hide there to catch insects for food.
have six legs. Goliath beetles and katydids are two kinds of insects.
can grow to be 6 inches long. The beetles are so large that some people say they sound like helicopters when they fly.
are covered in spikes and horns. They may look scary but are harmless. Their look is meant to scare other insects away.
Both arachnids and insects are invertebrates (in-VEHR-teh-brayts). They are animals with no backbone! Here are two more invertebrates that squirm and wiggle.
have a body part that makes a slimy liquid. As the slugs wiggle, the slime helps them slide and squirm along.

472,"Scientists from the United States are studying elephants in Africa. They say elephants make sounds that cannot be heard by humans. Now those scientists have found a way to study the sounds and what the sounds mean.
In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.
Move over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia.
The elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants. Workers will buy milk to feed elephants that have lost their mothers.
