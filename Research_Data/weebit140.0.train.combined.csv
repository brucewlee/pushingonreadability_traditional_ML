0,166,"Did you know that the sun can power a car? Students from Canada set a world record last summer with a car powered by the sun. The students drove 4,350 miles in the solar-powered car. It is the longest distance a solar car has ever traveled.
Because the car uses the sun for power, it does not pollute the air. Special cells are on top of the car. The cells collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. The electricity powers the car's motor.
Each day, the car used the same amount of electricity needed to run a toaster. The team hopes that someday more people will drive solar cars.

1,148,"Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe!
In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

2,336,"California Sea Lions live along the west coast of North America. The map shows the west coast of the U.S.
of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers.
San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!)
Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600!
Food to Eat and Room to Spread Out
Experts say the earthquake might have caused
, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore.
Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier.
Sea lions can grow to be up to 8 feet long and weigh up to 850 pounds.
Sea lions can swim up to 20 miles per hour.
Sea lions usually live between 20 and 30 years.
Sea lions eat fish, squid, and octopus. They have about 36 teeth but like to swallow their food whole.
Storm drains in Oxnard, California, usually don't bark. But they do if there is a sea lion stuck inside!
Two kids called the police when they heard barking and saw a sea lion inside a
. (A storm drain is a large pipe that drains rainwater into a lake or ocean.) A rescue team used a large fishing net to free the sea lion. The team spent five hours bringing the 350-pound sea lion out through a manhole.
Rescue workers took the sea lion back to the Pacific Ocean in a truck. They say the sea lion was probably swimming in a local harbor when it entered the drain.

All whales, like blue whales, breathe air through
. A blowhole is an opening on top of a whale's head. The blowhole is closed when the whale is under the water. When the whale comes to the top, its blowhole opens. The whale breathes out, making water spray into the air. Then the whale breathes in and goes under the water again.
Killer whales breach, or jump out of the water.
. A breaching whale jumps up out of the water. Then it comes down and makes a huge splash!
No one is sure why whales breach. Some people say that they do it just for fun!

12,460,"Scientists are hopping with joy. They recently found a new
, or type, of frog. It lives in Colombia. That is a country in South America.
The frog is very small. It is less than an inch long. Its skin is a golden color.
Scientists say the frog is part of a group called poison dart frogs. The frog's poison may injure or kill an animal that eats it. That is why poison dart frogs are so colorful. Their bright colors warn

13,527,"A Long Winter Sleep: How Do Animals Hibernate?
Many animals hibernate (HIGH-behr-nayt) during the winter. When an animal hibernates, it goes into a deep sleep. Animals hibernate when the weather gets cold and it is hard to find food. Animals like frogs, chipmunks, and bears hibernate.
In the fall, brown bears eat a lot of food. They eat berries, plants, and fish. Bears eat to build up fat. By the end of the fall, the bears start to hibernate in dens, which are caves or openings in the ground. They breathe slower and their hearts beat slower. They don't need to eat or drink because they use their fat to stay alive.
When fall comes, a chipmunk gathers extra food. It stores the extra food in its
, or hole in the ground. The chipmunk hibernates in its burrow for the winter. Sometimes, a hibernating chipmunk wakes up. It wakes up to eat some of its stored food. It eats berries, mushrooms, and nuts.
Some frogs hibernate in mud at the bottom of lakes or rivers. As they hibernate, they are very still and seem to be frozen. Frogs that hibernate take in oxygen from the water.
is a gas that living things need. The frogs take in the oxygen through their skin.
A brown bear can be about 5 feet tall while standing on all four feet.
A brown bear can run up to 30 miles per hour.
A baby brown bear can weigh less than 1 pound when it is born.
to spend the winter sleeping to conserve energy
Just before a bear begins to hibernate, it is very big. What might a bear look like after hibernating?

14,154,"in China. A fossil is the remains of an animal or a plant that lived long ago.
The spider lived 165 million years ago. Dinosaurs ruled Earth at that time. Spider fossils that old are
That means people have found very few of them.
This spider belongs to a family of spiders that is still alive today, says scientist Paul Selden. He studied the fossil. They are found in the United States and Mexico.
The spider fossil (above) is in great condition, says Selden.

21,499,"Some places get wet weather during spring.
Grab your raincoat and boots! Spring is here. That means warmer, rainy weather in some parts of the United States. Read the answers to some questions about wet weather.
A few wet drops land on your head. Its raining! Rain falls from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny bits of water and ice. The bits grow bigger as they join together. Some get so heavy that they fall to the ground. The ice melts if the air is warmer along the way. The raindrops reach the ground as water.
. Those are storms with heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. As lightning strikes, it heats the air around it. That causes the air to
, or get bigger. When that happens, you hear a loud sound called thunder.
When it rains, you may see a rainbow. It appears when sunlight passes through drops of water in the air. The drops break up the sunlight into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Why? Sunlight is always made up of those colors. They look white when they are together. The drops of water separate each color.
Why might it be useful to learn about weather?

25,187,"The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A
has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life.
People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow.
Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends.
People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery.
Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.
Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?

26,531,"More students are growing their own food.
Students at Madison Elementary gather around their garden.
Fruit and vegetable gardens are popping up at schools across the country. How did they get there? Students planted them.
Kids plant crops and later harvest them.
Kids at Madison Elementary School in Redondo Beach, California, plant gardens in the fall and the spring. In October, they planted lettuce, radishes, carrots, broccoli, peas, and cauliflower. They
the crops in January. To harvest is to gather a crop.
The vegetables were washed and served at a salad bar. Extra food was sold in the school cafeteria for lunch.
This month, students will plant tomatoes, corn, sunflowers, and strawberries.
Why are students learning how to grow gardens? Teachers want kids to learn healthy eating habits. Healthy foods give the body the energy it needs to grow and heal.
Many kids are now trying new foods and learning they like them. Lisa Samuelson is the parent volunteer in charge of the program. She says a lot of students have told her, I like salad. I didnt think I liked salad! Then those students have gone home and asked their parents to buy vegetables that they have tried at school.
Samuelsons daughter, Lucy, is one of those students. She is in second grade. I love the garden, she says. I didnt really like vegetables before we had the garden. Then we found out that gardening is cool. Now I like vegetables. My favorite is carrots.

28,87,"Rain forests are in trouble. They are disappearing. For many years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads.
Many groups are working to save rain forests. The forests are home to half the worlds plant and animal
, or types. Many of those species are in danger of dying out.
We have lost almost all of our worlds tropical rain forests, says Ashley Schaeffer. She is a spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network. That group is working to protect rain forests. Unless we take action now, they will all be gone, she says. We are working with large companies to get them to stop cutting down trees.
Farmers have destroyed a large area of this tropical rain forest.

37,432,"How does food get from the farm to you?
time! A harvest is the gathering of food. Many fruits and vegetables are
in the fall. They are fully grown. They are ready to be picked and eaten.
Miller Farms is busy with its fall harvest. The farm is in Platteville, Colorado. It grows many vegetables. Carrots, beets, and onions are just a few of them. David Patterson works on the farm. He told
Kids can visit the farm and pick their own vegetables.
 We pick the vegetables by hand each day. Carrots are kind of tough to pick. You have to loosen them with a shovel first.
 We bring the food in from the field with trucks. We put the food into crates.
 The crates get loaded onto a truck. We take the food to farmers markets to sell it. Its all fresh and good.
Why might fruits and vegetables need to be picked when they are ripe?

38,446,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

43,5,"Some ants live in special plants known as ant plants. Those plants have
parts where the ants can live. Something that is hollow has empty space inside. The ants help the plants by killing insects that eat the plants.
Scientists recently found that some ants can harm plants. The ants attack plants that do not have hollow parts. The ants dig tunnels in the plants to make nests. Why? Scientists say that when the ants run out of space in ant plants, they make room in other plants.
This ant and plant get along well. The ant lives inside the plants hollow parts. The ant kills insects that eat the plant.

45,622,"Our national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Did you know that the song is about a 200-year-old flag? Workers from a museum in Washington, D.C., are trying to make the flag look new again.
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag.
The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches!
Next, the flag's holes will be patched. The project will be finished in 2002.

Both the United States and Russia are worried about polar bears. Russia is a large country in Europe and Asia. Many polar bears are hunted each year. Some people eat polar bear meat.

Recently, both countries agreed to protect polar bears. People in each country can hunt only a small number of polar bears each year. They can no longer hunt female bears or

50,381,"Stay safe while having a super summer.
Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer.
Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The suns rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes.
If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a
(SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing.
You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the suns harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade!
What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you dont know how to swim, stay in the
end. Something that is shallow is not deep.
Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.
What other ways can you stay safe this summer?

51,566,"April 22 is Earth Day. That is a day for people to take action and help Earth. This year, Earth Day is 40 years old. To celebrate, 40 events will take place in cities around the world. The events were the idea of Earth Day Network. That group is trying to get more people to take care of Earth.
The main event is going to be held in Washington, D.C. People can go there to learn more about ways to help Earth, says Sean Miller. He is the education director at Earth Day Network.
Many people will take part in other Earth Day events too. Some people will clean up parks and beaches. Others will plant trees. What will you do on Earth Day?

55,439,"Last November, doctors operated on a clouded leopard named Joe. Joe had not been eating and had trouble walking. A disease was causing fluid to press on Joe's brain. This disease can also happen to cats, dogs, and humans. A two-hour operation saved Joe's life.
Joe is special because he is an endangered species. He is one of only a few hundred clouded leopards in the world.
Joe lives in Texas at the Fort Worth Zoo. He is often taken out of the zoo to visit people at schools and churches. A
, or animal doctor, at the zoo said Joe is ""part of the family.""

The project began in 2007 in Chicago, Illinois. The exhibit then traveled to other U.S. cities. This month, the globes will be in London, England.
People can take simple actions to help Earth, says Wendy Abrams. She is the person who came up with the idea of Cool Globes. We all have the power to do something, and together we can have an

60,578,"Gauri Nanda had trouble getting up in the morning. Her alarm clock would ring, and she would press the snooze button. Then she would not wake up on time.
One day, Nanda had an idea. She invented an alarm clock with wheels. She named it Clocky. Now people can use Clocky to help them wake up on time.
 A person hits the clocks snooze button, and the clock moves away.
 It can roll off a night table and move across the bedroom.
 As the clock moves, it beeps its alarm! That means that a person must get out of bed to find the clock.

62,247,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.

69,546,"About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools.
That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.

season is here. A hurricane is a storm that forms over warm ocean water. It brings strong winds and heavy rains. The season lasts from June to November.
Experts say the 2007 season will be a busy one. They want to make sure people are prepared.

Hurricanes can damage trees, cars, and buildings. A hurricane's strong winds can also make ocean levels rise. That is called a
It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding.
Hurricane Hunters are ready. They are a part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Their job is to fly airplanes into the
of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center.
Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become.
The three pictures show how a hurricane forms.
 First, small storms begin over an ocean.
 Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together.
 Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds.
Would you want to be a Hurricane Hunter in the U.S. Air Force? Why or why not?

75,253,"The Life of Martin Luther King Jr
A memorial for Martin Luther King Jr. is being built in our nation's capital.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He lived from 1929 to 1968. Americans honor him in January with a national holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 21.
King grew up in the southern part of the United States. At that time, laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were forced to sit in the back of buses. They also had to use separate bathrooms and water fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those laws. As a result, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws provide the same rights to all Americans.
King will soon be honored with a
. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. The King memorial is being built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the Mall.
The King memorial is scheduled to be finished this year. It will have a 30-foot statue of King. Sentences from some of his speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
The cost of the memorial is $100 million. Most of that money has been raised. A concert was held in September in New York City to raise the rest of the money. Many famous singers performed. The singers included Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Garth Brooks.

78,434,"What sounds do you hear right now? You may hear a fan blowing, kids talking, or a bell ringing. All the sounds you hear travel in waves. Those waves enter your outer ear. They travel through your middle ear and inner ear. Your inner ear sends a message to your brain. Then you hear sound. Study the ear below to learn more.
That means it moves quickly back and forth. When people speak, their vocal cords vibrate. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and makes sound.
Did you know that sounds can travel through solid materials? Try this experiment with a partner to find out. Place a plastic ruler on a table. Make sure one end is hanging over the edge. Hold the ruler down with one hand. Ask your partner to place his or her ear against the surface of the table. With your other hand, gently snap the end of the ruler that is hanging over the floor. What did you and your partner see, hear, and feel?

82,69,"How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

83,16,"More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didnt contain as much life as warmer waters.
A diver studies ocean animals near the cold South Pole.
How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole, says scientist David Barnes.
Why might it be useful for scientists to know which types of ocean animals live near the South Pole?

84,214,"2008 is the Chinese Year of the Rat.
February 7 is Chinese New Year! The celebration lasts 15 days. Each Chinese year is named after one of 12 animals. This is the Year of the Rat.
People prepare for the holiday before the actual day. They clean their homes and decorate them with flowers and poems. The poems are happy messages of good luck. People also put out bowls of tangerines, oranges, dried fruits, and candy to wish visitors a sweet new year.
On the first night of the celebration, families and friends gather for a special meal. Many people wear new red clothing. They eat foods such as dumplings, fish, and long noodles. Sweet, sticky rice cakes are a favorite treat.
The Chinese New Year celebration ends with the Lantern Festival. It includes music, dancing, and fireworks. Kids carry lanterns in a parade under the light of a full moon. The highlight of the parade is the dragon dance. Dancers carry a long dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets. The dragon may stretch more than 100 feet!

. Polluted water has harmful chemicals or trash in it. Those things can get into water in many ways. For example, chemicals can get into water if a factory dumps them into a river. Because water travels in a cycle, it can carry those chemicals into the ocean, the air, and the ground. Trash can get into our water when people dump it in the wrong places. Trash in the water can be very harmful to animals and plants.
You can help keep Earth's water clean too! Everything you do affects Earth's water in some way. Take a look at these tips.

Pick up trash you see on the ground and don't litter.
Earth Day is April 22. On Earth Day, many people help clean up parks, rivers, and beaches. Groups of volunteers from schools, churches, and neighborhoods join to help our Earth.

--The liquid falls from the clouds to the ground as rain or snow.
--The rain or snow ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans again.
Besides water, what are some things you could care for on Earth Day?

89,82,"Whiskers's class went to the museum for a field trip. But, oops, the story of their trip is in the wrong order. Use the clues to put the story in order.
Fourth, Whiskers and his class went to see the train display. They saw an old locomotive--a train's engine. The first locomotives used steam to move. This steam locomotive could pull many train cars, or parts of a train.
First, the students went to see the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs lived long ago. Dinosaurs are now extinct, or all gone. Scientists use dinosaur fossils, old bones or marks made by body parts or plants, to learn about dinosaurs.
Fifth, Whiskers saw real moon rocks and pictures of astronauts, the people trained to visit space. Astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to step onto the moon. He put an American flag up on the moon. He brought moon rocks back to Earth.
Second, Whiskers's class went to see an Egyptian mummy, or a dead body that has been kept in a special way. Egyptians buried their pharaohs, or kings, as mummies. The bodies were wrapped and put in fancy boxes. The boxes were decorated with paintings and writing.
Sixth, Whiskers's class met by the main door. They looked at a statue,or form of something or somebody. The statue is a copy of one called The Thinker. Whiskers was thinking, too. He was thinking about his day. He was glad he had visited the museum!
Third, Whiskers went with his class to see knights, or soldiers from long ago. Knights wore armor, or metal clothing, for protection. They used shields and swords to fight off enemies.

90,86,"Thanksgiving is about more than the food.
Thanksgiving today is much different from the first celebration of the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg). The Wampanoag were Native Americans who lived in the area where the Pilgrims settled.
In 1621, a harvest feast was celebrated in October.
is food that is grown and gathered. The feast became known as Thanksgiving. Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated in November. Look inside to learn more about the differences between then and now.
A Wampanoag man showed the Pilgrims how to grow corn by placing dried fish in the ground with seeds.
Many people today help others who are in need. They collect and donate food and clothes.
Turkey, fish, and corn were some of the foods that the Wampanoag and Pilgrims ate at the first harvest feast.
Many people eat turkey, stuffing, potatoes, corn, and cranberries on Thanksgiving.
The Pilgrims were thankful for their first harvest. Their celebration lasted for three days.
Thanksgiving is a day for people to give thanks for what they have. These kids make a ""tree of thanks.""
The Wampanoag and Pilgrims played games. Here, they play a game called pitching the bar.

97,260,"Cockroaches are not social insects, but they do live in groups. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cockroaches make group decisions. To do that, they created tiny robots that smelled like real roaches.
Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place.
Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too.
What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves.
The robotic cockroaches did not look like real insects. However, the real roaches did not notice. That is because scientists made sure that the robots smelled like roaches.

98,53,"When you smile, people can see your teeth and your gums. Experts say you need healthy teeth and gums. Teeth help you talk and eat. People need to care for their teeth. Turn the page to learn some ways to take care of your teeth.
Brush your teeth after every meal and before you go to bed. Use a soft toothbrush and a pea-sized amount of toothpaste. Brush all parts of your teeth and even your tongue! Brush with short back-and-forth movements.
Floss your teeth once a day. Dental floss is thin thread that helps clean in between your teeth. Use it to get rid of food you might have missed with a toothbrush. Have a grown-up help you floss.
Visit a dentist once or twice a year. The dentist will clean your teeth, take X-rays, and give you fluoride. Fluoride helps keep your teeth strong.

101,586,"On most days, you may see clouds in the sky. Where do they come from? When the sun heats oceans and lakes, water changes from a liquid to a gas. It rises into the air and cools. As it cools, the gas changes back into a liquid. It forms tiny drops of water or ice crystals. As they come together, they become clouds.
Clouds come in different shapes. Each shape is a clue to the kind of weather that is on the way. Learn about four kinds of clouds.
(SIHR-uhss) clouds are thin and wispy. They look like hairs. They are found high in the sky. Cirrus clouds can bring a change in the weather.
(KYOO-myuh-luhss) clouds are big and fluffy. They may look like cotton balls. They usually form low in the sky. Cumulus clouds often bring sunny, fair weather.
(STRAH-tuhss) clouds are long layers of clouds. They look like a blanket. They are low in the sky. Stratus clouds can bring light rain.
(kyoo-myuh-loh-NIM-buhss) clouds are big and gray. They are a kind of cumulus cloud. They can start near the ground and be very tall in the sky. Cumulonimbus clouds can bring heavy rain and thunderstorms. They also may mean a
is on the way. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind.

102,81,"Earth Day is a time for people to think about taking care of Earth. People can celebrate Earth Day by keeping plants and animals healthy. They can also help keep Earth clean. But taking care of Earth is important all of the time. Turn the page to see how you can be Earth-friendly every day!
Each person in the United States makes about 4 pounds of trash per day! So landfills, or places where people dump trash, are starting to get full. People should reduce, or make smaller, the amount of trash they throw away.
Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. Paper does not easily biodegrade, or break down. But paper is easily recycled, or used again, after going through a special process.
Recycle by taking old newspapers or old homework to a recycling center.
Some trash in landfills could be used for other things! Instead of throwing trash away, people should find more ways to reuse it, or use trash again.

103,541,"Many schools are growing their own food. Chatham Elementary School in Illinois is one of those schools. In September, students planted seeds in a garden. They are growing spinach, lettuce, radishes, and herbs.
A group of volunteers created the schools garden project. The group was started by Dr. Kemia Sarraf. She wants to teach kids healthy habits.
Gardens are wonderful, says Kim Sepich, the schools principal. When kids plant and grow their own food, they are more likely to try it. We want kids to eat their veggies!

106,376,"Every penny counts at Frankton Elementary School in Frankton, Indiana. Next month, students will take part in a contest called Jar Wars. Kids will drop money into jars. The grade that raises the most money will win a pizza party.
All the money will be donated to help save tropical rain forests. Why? People are cutting down rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of dying out.
Last year, the school raised $891. This year, the goal is to raise even more.
Teacher Ken Kakasuleff came up with the idea for Jar Wars 16 years ago. He says, Earth is our home. We feel proud to protect it.

is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.

116,198,"Learn about a woman who followed her dream
Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A
is a small bird that is usually yellow.
Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.
What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?

117,580,"Astronauts travel into space on a space shuttle. Most space trips take about ten days. During that time, astronauts work, eat, sleep, and have fun. Many things in the space shuttle are different than they are on Earth.
Eating in space can be hard because everything floats. Juice poured into a cup will float away and crumbs can get into air vents. So astronauts drink and eat in special ways. Astronauts drink with special straws and pouches. The pouch closes around the straw so juice doesn't leak out. Astronauts eat foods that don't make crumbs, like tortillas instead of bread.
On Earth, people usually sleep in beds. But most astronauts sleep in sleeping bags. The sleeping bags are in little cubbies. That way, a sleeping astronaut won't lose his or her pillow or float into something!
Astronauts have to work hard in space. Astronauts make sure that the space shuttle is in good condition. They clean air vents and check the engines and computers. The astronauts also do research and tests. Their work helps people learn about space.
A space shuttle does not have much room inside. But astronauts can still have fun. Astronauts like to watch Earth from the windows. They also like to use exercise bikes or float around the shuttle together.
What would you do for fun while in space?

122,620,"The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are
in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades.
 The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.
 The Everglades are the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators live.

123,510,"Goats are helping to prevent forest fires.
Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

125,370,"Schools across the country are trying to protect kids from getting hurt by heavy backpacks. Researchers say heavy backpacks can hurt kids' backs and cause kids to fall down.
Some schools are giving students two sets of textbooks. Students keep one set in school, and they leave the other set at home. That way, kids don't have to carry books back and forth every day.
Experts say that a kid who weighs 60 pounds should carry a backpack that weighs 9 pounds or less. If a kid weighs 70 pounds, his or her pack should weigh no more than 12 pounds.

128,520,"Healthy foods are good for you! They help your body grow. They also give you energy to work and play.
How do you know which foods to eat? Follow the food pyramid. Use it to make good choices. Choose more foods from groups on the pyramid with wider stripes.
The grains group gives you energy. Make sure at least half the grains you eat are whole grains. Eat brown rice, oatmeal, and popcorn. Try whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.
Color your plate with all kinds of veggies. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Experts say to eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Munch on carrots, corn, and broccoli.
The meat and bean group is high in protein. That helps build strong muscles. Eat fish, chicken, lima beans, and nuts.
Fruits are natures treats. They are sweet and tasty. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth too. Eat a variety of colors. Try an apple or a banana. You can also mix pieces of different fruits to make a salad.
Have milk and foods made with milk. Those foods are high in calcium. Calcium builds strong bones. Foods made with milk can be high in fat. Try low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Your body needs only a little oil to keep it healthy. Some foods that have oils are nuts, tuna fish, and salad dressing.
The child climbing the food pyramid is a reminder to exercise. Why might exercise be important?

137,388,"Just where the mighty Amazon, a river located in South America, starts had been a mystery. But a team of explorers has found the answer.
The team says the Amazon begins on a mountain named Nevado Mismi. The mountain is in the country of Peru and is 18,363 feet high. It is part of the Andes mountain range.
Freezing temperatures, strong winds, and rocky land made the mountain trip difficult for the explorers. They traveled by foot, car, bicycle, and even horseback. Even though the trip was hard, the team is happy to have solved the mystery.

141,340,"New NASA projects get ready to take flight.
Get ready for a birthday party thats out of this world. NASA turns 50 on October 1! The U.S. space agency has a lot to celebrate. NASA was
, or started, in 1958. Since then, the agency has
, or sent, more than 250 astronauts into space. The agency has also created robot spacecraft to explore
, or faraway, planets. There are even U.S. astronauts living and working in space on the International Space Station.
NASA officials have big plans for the next 50 years too. They plan to send humans back to the moon by 2020. U.S. astronauts first visited the moon in 1969. They stayed less than a day. This time, astronauts will live on the moon for up to six months.
NASA is designing a new spacecraft to carry the astronauts to the moon. Scientists are also redesigning the space suit. They say astronauts will need lighter suits for exploring.
Scientists hope that the moon mission will lead to an even bigger trip. NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars! The space agency has sent robot spacecraft called
to explore the Red Planet. NASA will send a new rover to Mars next fall.
Scientists want to determine whether Mars could have supported life at one time. They hope astronauts will one day be able to answer that question themselves.
Were trying to [go to Mars] as early as 2035, Jeff Hanley of NASA told
. Maybe someday in the far, far future [humans will reach] the stars.
NASAs history is a blast from the past! Read the time line to learn some important firsts in U.S. space travel and exploration.
U.S. astronaut Alan Shepard is the first American in space.
Americans become the first people to walk on the moon.
The International Space Station is under construction. It should be finished by 2010.
How would visiting Mars be different from visiting the moon? Why?

142,150,"Green sea slugs (below) dont just look like leaves. They act like them too! Experts recently found that the slugs are able to carry out
(foh-toh-SIN-thuh-sehss). That is the process plants use to turn sunlight into energy. The slugs are the only animals scientists know of that are able to carry out that process.
The sneaky slugs get their green thumbs from
Algae are plantlike creatures that carry out photosynthesis. Eating algae gives the slugs special materials that allow them to get energy from the sun instead of from food.
It takes only one helping of algae for the colorful critters to be able to perform photosynthesis, explains Sidney K. Pierce. He is one of the scientists who made the discovery. After eating algae once, the slugs depend on only the sun for energy. They never have to eat again, Pierce told

149,523,"The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students reading lessons.
, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. He responds in so many ways, teacher Judy Quigley told
Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they dont worry about making mistakes. When you read to people, sometimes they dont really listen, but he always listens, Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told
Students keep Starbucks attention by changing their reading styles during stories. I say it kind of louder so he can hear it, explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesnt work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!

157,472,"Experts connect a shipwreck to a famous pirate.
During the early 1700s, there was a man who struck fear in the hearts of sailors. Seeing his pirate ship on the high seas might have made them yell, Shiver me timbers!
The News & Observer, Robert Willett/AP Images
Crews bring up a 3,000-pound anchor from the shipwreck.
His name was Edward Teach. People called him Blackbeard. He was a cruel pirate captain with a long black beard. He robbed and hurt people along the eastern coast of North America until 1718. That year, his ship crashed. It sank near North Carolina. Blackbeard got away. He was killed soon after.
When experts found a shipwreck in that area a few years ago, they thought it might be Blackbeards boat. Recently, they
it. To confirm is to make certain.
It rests on the ocean floor off the coast of Beaufort, North Carolina.
Researchers found many weapons near and inside the ship. The finds included parts of a sword and many cannons. Blackbeard most likely used the battle gear to
other ships. To seize is to take over.
Blackbeards scary appearance also helped him get what he wanted. During battles, the pirate was said to have put lit matches under his hat. That caused smoke to appear around his beard.
Experts are continuing to study Blackbeards ship. They are collecting
including a bell, that the pirate left behind. An artifact is a very old object.
Mark Wilde-Ramsing is one scientist studying the ship. These [objects] will help us better understand how pirates lived during the early days of America, he told
They may not make their victims walk the plank. But pirates continue to attack ships on the high seas. There were more than 260 pirate attacks in the first six months of this year. That is according to the ICC International Maritime Bureau. That group tracks pirate activity. Many of those attacks took place off the eastern coast of Africa.
Todays pirates use technology to find their victims. They board ships by climbing ropes attached to the sea crafts railings. The thieves steal the ships and the
Those are goods. Pirates take billions of dollars worth of goods each year.
How might experts have proved that the ship belonged to Blackbeard?

The spewer is called Axial Seamount. It rests at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The peak is about 250 miles from Oregon.
Scientists have been watching changes in the volcanos activity. Based on those changes, they decided that Axial Seamount would erupt. They said it would happen by 2014.
Researchers recently sent a robot down to the volcano to take pictures. They saw that the area was covered in lava. Scientists say the spewer erupted in April.
Experts hope the volcanos rumbles will help them learn more about underwater spewers, explains scientist Bill Chadwick.
This is the first time we have been able to [study] an eruption at an underwater volcano, he told

159,369,"Why is this rain forest shrinking so quickly?
Bright-colored birds fly through the air. Monkeys leap from tree to tree. Jaguars creep on the ground below. Those are just a few of the thousands of animals that live in the Amazon rain forest.
The Amazon in South America is the largest
in the world. A tropical rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall.
People are destroying the Amazon. Each year, farmers and loggers cut down rain forest trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Scientists have recently discovered that the Amazon is shrinking twice as quickly as they once thought.
The Amazon rain forest is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant
or variety. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines people need come from the Amazon.
The Amazon rain forest also helps recycle Earths air. The trees give off oxygen for people to breathe. Trees also clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans.
Stopping people from destroying the rain forest is not an easy task. ""Almost 2 million people make the forest their home,"" scientist Jim Bowyer told
""All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive. Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""
April 22 is Earth Day. How can you help protect our planet?
Rain forest trees stay green all year long.
The tallest trees may grow up to 200 feet!
When leaves and branches fall, they break down and release nutrients into the soil.

161,552,"Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide!
Scientists arent quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea.
The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets.
The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

162,427,"The days of stinky feet are over. Gang Sun, a scientist, has invented a smell-free sock.
The sock's fibers are made with bits of
Chlorine is a chemical used to kill
Bacteria are tiny germs that you can see only with a microscope. Bacteria cause socks to smell. In the new socks, the chlorine kills any odor-causing bacteria.
A cross-country running team tested the socks. ""After running 9 miles, not having socks smell of feet is a real bonus,"" said one runner.

163,242,"Is your backpack weighing you down? If the answer is yes, you are not the only one. Millions of kids load their backpacks full of heavy books and other supplies. American kids carry an average of 20 pounds on their backs!
Studies show that wearing a heavy backpack can cause back and shoulder injuries later in life. Experts say that kids get more injuries when they wear their backpacks over one shoulder. Wearing both shoulder straps evens out the weight.
Companies are now making backpacks that are better for the back. Some backpacks have wheels so you can pull them. Others have padded neck and back supports. No matter which type you choose, be smart and wear your backpack correctly. Your back will thank you!

165,282,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values Contest. Nearly 14,000 students in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
To enter, kids had to write an essay on which American value is most important in daily life. David chose to write about selfless service. He wrote, ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
The prize for the contest was a trip to Washington, D.C. David attended the Veterans Day ceremonies on November 11. The next day, David toured the Pentagon and was made honorary mayor for the day.

168,373,"Artist Cynthia Vose believes that hats tell a story. Women have worn different hats throughout history. In honor of Womens History Month, Vose organized an art exhibit about hats. The exhibit is taking place this month at a library in Billerica, Massachusetts.
""Beyond fashion, hats represent the changing roles of women in society.""
In the 1800s, many American women wore bonnets. As women gained rights, they no longer wore hats just for fashion. Women began to wear hats for jobs that were once held by men.

169,411,"Nine giant panda cubs are born in China.
Giant pandas feast on bamboo at the Beijing Zoo in China. These animals, including the newborn panda (inset), live in captivity.
China is hosting a panda party! Nine giant panda bears were recently born in the Asian country. Most of them are pairs of twins. The cubs were born in
. That means they live in places controlled by humans rather than in the wild. These pandas live in special centers where animal experts care for them.
[The centers] provide a safe place for animals to ... raise their young, scientist Sarah Bexell told
Thats a good thing, because giant pandas need all the help they can get. The animals are
, or at risk of dying out completely. Only about 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild.
Pandas favorite food is bamboo, but they have trouble finding enough of it to eat. Almost all of the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. The bamboo has died in part because people have built cities where pandas live.
People created the panda centers to help keep the giant pandas safe. One of the most famous centers is the Wolong Nature Reserve. It is in southwest China. More than 100 giant pandas have been born there since it opened in 1980.
The goal is for the young pandas to be able to live safely in the wild one day. Until then, some of the animals will continue to live in captivity. Scientists in China hope to raise more giant pandas within the next few years.
The future of captive giant pandas is [very] bright, Bexell says.
Chinas giant panda cubs arent the only baby animals making the news. Read to learn about other
Seven white lion cubs were recently born in Germany at a safari park. All of the white lions in the world live in captivity.
Hadiah is a type of hairless pig. She was born at the Houston Zoo in Texas. Little Hadiah weighed about 1 pound at birth.
More than 120 shortsnouted sea horses were recently born at an England aquarium. They will grow up to look like this one.
Why might people want to protect giant pandas?

170,135,"Almost 1 billion people dont have clean water, a report finds.
What do you do when youre thirsty? Chances are you get a glass of water from the sink. Not everyone can do that. In fact, almost 1 billion people around the world dont have clean drinking water.
A boy in Africa stands near a water pump. It is the only source of water in his village.
Thats the finding of a new report by world aid groups. The study looked at the living conditions of people around the globe. Many have to walk hours each day to collect water from rivers. Often that water is not safe to drink, because its dirty.
About 2.6 billion people dont have safe places to go to the bathroom, the report says. Lakshmi, 11, lives in a poor village in India. That is a country in Asia. For a long time, her school did not have bathrooms. She and her classmates had to use bushes outside.
World leaders say its important for kids such as Lakshmi to have good
or cleanliness. Drinking clean water and washing your hands after using the bathroom can help prevent diseases.
pipes around the world. To install is to set up. The pipes give people water in their homes. Aid workers also teach people how to
or clean, rainwater. They are even building bathrooms. Thats made a difference for Lakshmi. My school has toilets now, she says.
Still, there is a lot more to do, aid worker Clarissa Brocklehurst says. We must act now as one ... community to [supply] water and [good hygiene] for all.
How much water do you use? A lot! On average, each American goes through about 100 gallons of water a day. Thats enough to fill 1,600 drinking glasses! Here are some tips to
Keep your pearly whites clean, but be sure to shut off the faucet while you brush. That can save about 8 gallons of water a day.
Put away that rubber ducky. Taking a bath can use up to 70 gallons of water, while showering uses just 10 to 25 gallons of water.
In one day, a faucet can drip more than 20 gallons of water, and a leaky toilet can waste 200 gallons! Ask an adult to stop the drips.
How would your life be different without running water in your home?

172,740,"Veterans visit classrooms across the country to talk with students.
When Christopher Bain visits schools, he shows students his Army uniform. He also talks to them about the American flag and what it
who lives in Williamsport, Pa. A veteran is a person who has served in the U.S. armed forces. November 11 is
, a day when Americans honor veterans. There are almost 25 million U.S. veterans living today.
Bain is just one of many veterans who visits with students. Now a new program is helping to connect more students with veterans like Bain. It is called Take a Veteran to School Day. The program was created by the History Channel. It encourages schools to invite veterans to speak to students of all ages. Representatives from the History Channel say it's important that students know veterans.
One school to get on board with the program was Steven G. Schorr Elementary School in Las Vegas, Nev. That's where the Take a Veteran to School Day program was announced in May. Third graders met several veterans at the event. Jennifer Rowland is a teacher at the school. ""My students were really able to grasp the meaning and importance of Veterans Day by meeting an actual veteran,"" she told
. ""They loved trying on and touching an actual [military] helmet!""
Veterans get a lot out of the experience too. Bain served in the Iraq war. ""I tell [students] a little bit about my story,"" he told
. ""I wanted to serve my country so I can keep [Americans'] way of life and keep the freedoms that we have.""
Nearly 2 million U.S. veterans are women.
The country's oldest and largest Veterans Day parade is held in Birmingham, Ala.
In 1968, Congress passed a law to move Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October. The holiday was switched back to November 11 in 1978.
Men and women are not the only military heroesdogs can be veterans too! Dogs, such as German shepherds, began serving in the U.S. armed forces in the 1940s. Today they continue to assist soldiers. Military dogs
, or guard, areas and sniff out bombs and traps.
What can kids learn by listening to U.S. veterans talk about their experiences?

174,183,"Experts rush to keep historic Venice afloat.
For many, Venice is the jewel of Italy. It is famous for its beautiful buildings, art, and
The canals, or waterways, take the place of roads. People travel through the city on boats. But this city, which attracts millions of tourists each year, is in danger of sinking.
Venice is located on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
A lagoon is an area of shallow water.
During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water!
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city.
Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt done carefully.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city.
Venice is known as the City of Canals.
There are about 150 canals in Venice.
About 400 bridges connect the citys 118 islands.

175,392,"Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

176,710,"Some kids who want to play tag are out of luck. The game has been
at Willet and McCarthy elementary schools in Massachusetts. (
means ""not allowed."") Those students are not alone. A growing number of schools across the country have put an end to the playground game.
Recess is safer without tag, say some school officials. At Freedom Elementary School in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the game often led to pushing and fighting. ""To be safe, [all students] must keep their hands and feet to themselves,"" the principal, Cindy Farwell, told
Others think banning tag goes too far. ""It's telling children we don't trust them to be safe when they play games,"" says Rhonda Clements. She teaches physical education at a college in New York. Clements also says kids should be able to choose whom they play with and what they play.

177,407,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of a famous decision that changed American history. It all started with a court case called
In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.
Today, Linda Brown is grown up. She travels around the country to speak about the case. She recently told an audience, ""Little did my father know that when he stepped off the witness stand, he stepped into the history pages.""

178,507,"Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa.
A mother cheetah rests with her cubs in the tall grass. Their spotted fur helps them stay hidden. The mother cheetah does not know it, but animal experts are tracking her every move.
Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats.
The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs.
The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs.
The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild.
""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah.""
Cheetahs can run 65 miles per hour. That is about as fast as a car driving on a highway!
In one second, cheetahs can run about 92 feet.
Cheetahs can run fast for only a short distance about a quarter of a mile.

179,516,"Theres a new croc on the block! Researchers recently announced finding an ancient crocodile in South America. They dug up the creatures remains in Colombia.
(ack-your-ON-tih-soo-cuss gwa-hee-RAH-en-siss). The croc lived about 60 million years ago.
The giant crocodile lived in a river. That surprised researchers because other types of ancient crocodiles lived mainly in the ocean.
This drawing shows how the snapper may have looked.
The finding may help explain how some crocodiles
when dinosaurs died off. To survive is to live. One of the ways they [survived] was [by] living in lots of different places, Alex Hastings told
. He wrote a study about the new croc.
Life wasnt a snap for the creature, though. It most likely had to battle with the worlds largest snake for food. It was not an easy life even for a 20-foot crocodile, Hastings says.

The sound of money was heard loud and clear this August at the World's Fair of Money. It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
One billion dollars' worth of coins were at the fair. The money was available for buying and selling. Some coins cost less than a dollar. Other coins were worth millions.
Eight-year-old Sam Zurenski and his grandfather were among the visitors. Sam's grandfather collected coins when he was a boy. Now he is helping Sam build his own collection.
For many people, it's the story behind the coin that has them collecting. ""Every piece of money has a story to tell,"" said one coin expert. ""Money... is history you can hold in your hand.""

Scientists in Bolivia recently figured out that bugs help make some chili peppers spicy. Bolivia is a country in South America.

, or sick. Chili peppers create special chemicals to keep the bugs away. Those chemicals also give peppers their famous spicy flavor.
Ready for some more hot news? Some chili peppers get even spicier as they grow. Peppers increase ... their heat as they ripen, scientist Joshua Tewksbury told reporters. I think a lot of plants would love to come up with this [way to keep bugs away].

185,461,"The ocean is full of mystery and surprise. A team of ocean explorers recently found out just how surprising!
, on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The ship sank in a hurricane in 1865. Reports say that 20,000 gold coins went down with the ship.
Today, experts say, the coins may be worth up to 180 million dollars. If so, that would make it the richest treasure ever found in a shipwreck.
. Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. ""The [recovery] we are planning will focus on bringing the story of this amazing ship back to life,"" said one explorer.

186,277,"Scientists in England are buzzing about a recent discovery. They figured out how bees and other insects fly so well. The research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft.
Cameras and sensors could be attached to the aircraft. These machines may one day be used for monitoring traffic or even for spying.
The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and are
(can bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.

187,318,"Rosa Parks is arrested and fingerprinted again in February 1956 for breaking segregation laws.
Fifty years ago, the courageous act of Rosa Parks changed history.
For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail.
At that time, states in the South were
by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities.
After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The
was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal.
December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history.
Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott.
""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told
""Rosa Parks's not giving up her seat on the bus shows how important it is to stand up for what we believe in,"" says Mullinax.
Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955.
Why should people stand up for what they believe in?

188,513,"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is located in northern Alaska. The ANWR is home to polar bears, wolves, caribou, and other animals.
In 1960, the land was made a protected area for animals and plants. But now, President George W. Bush wants to allow companies to begin drilling for oil in the ANWR.
Supporters say that the oil drilling would provide jobs for Alaskans. They also argue that the oil in the ANWR will help lower oil and gasoline prices. They say that taking oil from U.S. land is cheaper than using foreign oil.
Today, most of the oil that is used in the United States is
Opponents say the drilling would pollute the area's land, air, and water. Pollution would harm the plants that the area's animals eat to survive.
Studies by the U.S. government show there may be only a six-month supply of oil in the ANWR. Opponents believe the risk of polluting the ANWR is not worth such a small supply of oil.
Is drilling for oil in the ANWR worth the risk to plants and animals?

190,409,"Pilots help whooping cranes find their way.
High in the sky, a flock of birds flies south. The birds are
. At about 5 feet tall, they are the tallest birds in North America.
The wild animals appear to be following larger birds. But those are not birds at all. They are people flying three-wheeled aircraft called
. The pilots are wearing white helmets and gowns.
That might sound like a birdbrained idea, but its not. The pilots are from an organization called Operation Migration. They are helping the whooping cranes learn to
To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change.
Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes dont know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes dont have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot.
Thats where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock.
It takes about three months for the birds to reach the Southwith plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special
or protected areas, in Florida. By then, the birds know how to migrate. This spring, birds that flew with the pilots last fall will return to the North on their own.
For Duff, the best part of the trip is bringing whooping cranes to the refuges. Its [a nice feeling] because you know the birds are going to make it, he told
Last fall, pilots in Wisconsin led a flock of whooping cranes across seven states. In Florida, the flock was divided and taken to two refuges. Study the map for a birds-eye view of their trip.

191,204,"An eclipse of the moon is coming soon! A
will appear in the sky on December 10. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through Earths shadow. Earth blocks direct sunlight to the moon, and the moon becomes dark. That gives it a spooky glow. In North America, people will be able to see only part of the eclipse.
Who turned out the lights? The moon will darken in an eclipse.
The moon does not disappear completely during an eclipse. Instead, it may turn bright red or brown.
People can see an eclipse without a telescope. Its pretty cool, Noah Petro told
. He is a scientist at NASA. That is the U.S. space agency. If its [a] clear [night], you should be able to see it.
Lunar eclipses can help experts learn more about space. Its an unusual event, says Petro. It provides [an] opportunity to study the moon.

192,623,"Theres a bookworm in the White House. Its U.S. President Barack Obama. He wrote a new book for kids. The book is called
Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.
The picture book goes on sale November 16. It tells the stories of 13 important Americans, including baseball player Jackie Robinson. He was the first African American to play major-league baseball since the late 1800s.
Obama was excited to pen the book. Its a great
for me to speak to young people, he said in an interview on Sirius XM Radio. An opportunity is a chance.
The inspiring tales already have two young fansObamas daughters, Malia and Sasha. There is a drawing of them walking their dog on the cover. The girls were among the first people to review the book. I asked them to read it, [to] see what they thought, Obama says. They approved!

193,544,"One fish, two fish, red fish ... see-through fish? Researchers in Japan recently produced a goldfish so
, or light in color, you can see its insides (below). Japan is a country in Asia.
The fishs gills and muscles can be seen through its light-colored body. Several other
can also be seen, including the heart, stomach, and brain. An organ is a body part.
The see-through goldfish gives experts and students a new way to study the animals, says researcher Yutaka Tamaru. They can see how the fishs organs work without hurting it.
The creature is expected to live up to 20 years. It could grow to be 10 inches long and weigh about 5 pounds. As the goldfish grows bigger, you can watch its whole life, Tamaru told

194,342,"What's green, wears a crown, and is a symbol of freedom? The Statue of Liberty! Over the years, millions of people have visited this statue in New York City. However, it has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Visitors have not been allowed to climb the 354 steps to the crown.
Experts say that it might be difficult for people to make their way down from the statue's crown in an emergency. The group that cares for Lady Liberty is raising money to make the statue safer so it can reopen. Officials have not said whether people will be allowed to climb above the
, or base, of the statue again.
For third grader Nina Wade that would be very sad news. She moved to New York City almost two years ago and has never climbed the statue's steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" Nina told Weekly Reader, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials are] taking safety measures.""

Why did dozens of harlequin frog species start vanishing 20 years ago? Scientists studying the brightly colored frogs might have solved the mystery. The experts blame a skin
for causing the frogs to die off. A fungus is a form of plant life that can cause disease in animals.
Harlequin frogs are not the only creatures in danger of dying out because of the disease. ""This fungus is killing amphibians all over the world,"" scientist Cynthia Carey told
is an animal with a backbone that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians. They are
which means their body temperature depends on their environment.
Scientists are working to save the worlds amphibians. Many of these creatures have already become
or died out completely. Disease is not the only danger for amphibians. Their habitat is being destroyed as people cut down trees in the areas where the animals live. Hunting, pollution, and weather changes are also contributing to the problem.
Is there any good news for frogs and other amphibians? The new findings will lead to more research, says Carey. The research could help scientists save the remaining animals before the fungus spreads. ""Weve identified the disease and how it works,"" scientist Karen Lips told
""Now we can try to stop it.""
What might happen if amphibians become extinct?

196,602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.
So the saying ""Kindness is its own reward"" may not be true just for humans.
Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.
The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa.
uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa.
The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia.
is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa.
What does the expression ""Kindness is its own reward"" mean?

197,519,"This discovery will knock your socks off! Scientists recently found footprints that are more than a million years old.
The footprints are in Kenya. That is a country in Africa. An early human
, or relative from the past, may have made the prints. The feet that made the prints had rounded heels and big toes that point forward, just like people have today.
U.S. scientist John Harris helped discover the special prints. He and his team found four sets of adult footprints in the area. They also found tracks of animals such as lions.
The footprints could teach people a lot about what Earth was like a million years ago. Figuring that out is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, Harris told reporters.
Scientists tracked down this ancient footprint in Africa.

198,376,"Hair, beware! Youre sitting at your desk, when suddenly your head feels itchy. Its under attack from tiny insects that cause big troublehead lice!
Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. In fact, that is the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against the little pests. The group has started a national program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free.
Lice can spread very quickly from one person to another. The bugs cant jump or fly, but they can crawl. Follow these tips from health experts to keep lice from bugging you:
Avoid touching your head to someone elses head.
Dont share personal items such as hats, combs, and headphones.
Use your own sleeping bag and pillow on sleepovers.

199,526,"What is colorful, plastic, and nearly 100 feet tall? The worlds tallest LEGO tower!
, or built, in Vienna, Austria. Austria is a country in Europe. The plastic creation broke the
world record for the tallest LEGO building. Something that is previous came before.
The tower was made up of about 460,000 LEGOs. More than 3,000 people helped build it in four days.
Most of the builders were children. Each young helper made a part of the tower. The designs were different, says LEGO spokesperson Kate Sutch. Some kids built their sections in patterns.
Breaking the record feels amazing, Sutch told
. It took ... hard work and creativity, but in the end, the kids of Vienna [did it]!

The face of the United States is changing. Hispanic Americans, also known as Latinos, make up the fastest-growing group. The latest U.S.
update shows that 41 million people are Hispanic. A census is a count of people.
Hispanic Americans are people whose families are from Spanish-speaking countries. Most of those countries are in Central and South America.
Nearly 297 million people live in the United States today. One of every seven people in our country is Hispanic!
The news comes just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month. It takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. During this time, Americans honor Hispanic history and customs. Many families celebrate by taking part in festivals and parades.

201,641,"Workers clean the Gulf of Mexico after an oil spill.
At a busy aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana, a sea turtle splashes about in clean, clear water. Its hard to imagine that just weeks ago the animal was covered in greasy oil.
Experts wash a bird rescued from the oily water.
the sea turtle from an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. That body of water is south of the United States. To rescue something is to save it.
Until recently, oil had been spilling into the gulf for months. The oil
miles of sea and beaches. To damage something is to harm it. Thousands of animals were trapped in the sticky stuff.
The spill began in April. Workers were drilling from on top of an
in the gulf. That is a building in the sea. It is used to collect oil. Suddenly, the oil rig exploded. The accident caused an oil well at the bottom of the gulf to leak.
Since then, experts have been trying to stop the oil from spreading. They recently plugged the well with cement. Workers are also cleaning the water. The cleanup could take years, experts say.
The work is starting to make a difference, though. Officials recently reopened part of the gulf to fishing. That is good news for people who live near the gulf.
We love the land, Alma Robichaux told
She lives in Louisiana. We cant go anywhere else.
The oil spill isnt the first big trouble for the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina hit the area in August 2005. The huge storm killed more than 1,300 people in five states.
New Orleans, Louisiana, was one of the worst-hit areas. Even today, parts of the city look as if the hurricane just happened. Many peoples homes are still damaged from the storm.
A group of kids works to repair houses. To repair is to fix. The group is called Beacon of Hope.
Student Emma Ridenhour recently lent a hand. After five years, theres still a lot of work to be done, she told
It means a lot that I could ... help.
How might the oil spill affect people in other parts of the country? Why?

202,449,"In 1914, a group of explorers, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, wanted to cross Antarctica. However, after two months of sailing, they never even made it to Antarctica's shore.
Their ship became trapped in floating ice blocks for nine months. Later, when their ship,
was crushed by the closing ice, Shackleton and 28 men were forced to camp on the ice.
After camping on the ice for five months, Shackleton and five men sailed 800 miles in a tiny lifeboat to get help. The remaining crew was later rescued. Amazingly, all 29 men on the
survived being stranded for 17 months on Antarctica's ice.

204,727,"As Ellen MacArthur crossed the finish line of the Vendee Globe race, she sailed right into the history books. MacArthur, aboard her sailboat called
set two world's records in the around-the-world race.
The Vendee Globe is one of the world's toughest sailing races. Sailors must race nonstop around the world. And if that were not hard enough, all sailors must sail
Ellen MacArthur, a 24-year-old Englishwoman, finished second in the 2000 Vendee Globe. She sailed about 31,000 miles in 94 days, 4 hours, 25 minutes, 40 seconds. MacArthur finished only one day after the winner, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux.
Despite finishing in second place, MacArthur made good enough time to win two titles--the fastest woman and the youngest person ever to finish a solo around-the-world race.
During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her!
Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board
I just adore being at sea, and to suddenly stop this will not be easy at all,"" she said.

Like other carnivores, this dinosaur had sharp claws and could move fast. At the same time, it had teeth shaped for eating leaves, and a long neck to reach tall trees.
The fossils are an important discovery, say scientists. They hope it will help them understand how the dinosaurs changed from a diet of meat to one of plants.

206,689,"Some projects take longer than others. The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota is one of them. Workers started carving the giant rock sculpture in 1948. They are still working on it today.
The memorial honors Chief Crazy Horse. Native American leaders chose to honor him because he was one of their heroes. Chief Crazy Horse was a Native American who fought for his people's right to their land and traditions.
When will the sculpture be finished? No one knows for sure. All that matters is that it's going forward, said the project manager.

207,220,"Spring training has begun! The 30 major-league baseball teams are practicing in Florida and Arizona for the upcoming season. The teams practice in those states because of the warm weather there.
During the winter, one of baseball's best players joined a new team. Alex Rodriguez signed a record
or agreement, to play for the Texas Rangers. He will be paid $252 million over ten years. That's about $25 million a year!

208,49,"Talk about a birds-eye view! Scientists recently built a tiny spy plane shaped like a hummingbird.
The winged wonder can travel at speeds of up to 11 miles per hour. It can fly up and down, forward and backward, and sideways. The flying machine also has a built-in camera that records images and sound.
The U.S. military plans to use the little flying tool to spy on enemies. The lifelike bird can fly
into enemy areas. Something that is undetected is not noticed. Firefighters may also use the remote-controlled aircraft to help find missing people in emergencies. It could fly into tight spaces, Matt Keennon told
Scientists are excited to see their new creation put into action. The aircraft could ... become a useful tool, says Keennon. [It could] save lives.

211,33,"In June, Elin Gonzlez returned to his home in Cuba. He had lost his mother last year when their U.S.-bound boat sank off the coast of Florida. After Elin was rescued, his father wanted him returned to Cuba. But relatives in Miami wanted Elin to stay in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, paving the way for Elin's return to Cuba.

212,128,"The life cycle of a frog is amazing. Read below to learn more. (Note: Although many frogs have this life cycle, others do not. Some frogs don't even have tadpoles; instead their eggs hatch directly into frogs!)
A frog begins life as a tiny egg, usually in or near water.
After about 10 days, a tadpole hatches from the egg. It breathes using gills and moves like a fish.
After about five weeks, the tadpole's gills disappear, and it grows lungs.
At about 12 weeks, the young frog grows legs, and its tail disappears. It leaves the water and can live on land.

215,700,"California has the bluesblue butterflies, that is! Scientists in the state recently released 80 Palos Verdes blue butterflies into the wild.
The experts raised the fliers because the insects are endangered. They can live only in a small area of California. That area is called the Palos Verdes
A peninsula is a stretch of land that is bordered by water on three sides.
The butterflies lay their eggs on two types of plants found on the peninsula. However, those plants have been harmed by people moving into the area.
To save the butterflies, scientists grow the insects favorite plants in parks around the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Then they release the insects into those areas each spring.
Scientist Jana Johnson hopes her work helps the blue butterflies bounce back with flying colors. We are undoing the wrongs of the past and trying to save this planet, one species at a time, she told

216,111,"A new report shows pythons are spreading.
Whats 23 feet long, as thick as a telephone pole, and slithering into a state near you? A Burmese python!
Pythons and other giant snakes are worming their way into Florida and other states. That is the finding of a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The species are not
to, or originally from, the area. They might have started out as pets that were set free. Many pythons are native to Asia.
Today, there are tens of thousands of pythons in Florida. They may one day creep into almost one-third of the United States, scientists say.
They [can move] long distances in a short period of time, scientist Gordon Rodda told
. He worked on the study. We had a python in Florida that in a few weeks ... traveled 30 miles.
. Those are groups of plants and animals that live in the same area. The snakes eat everything from birds to bobcats. They lie still until an animal comes near. Then the
strike. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that often have scales.
U.S. officials are coming up with ways to stop the snakes. One idea is to
people from bringing pythons into the country. To ban is to prevent.
People in Florida move an 18-foot-long python to a safer home.
People who own pet snakes can help too, Rodda says. If you have a snake that gets too big for your home, take it to a zoo. We dont want to create a problem by [setting free] an animal we no longer want to take care of, says Rodda.
What makes giant snakes special? Wrap your head around these python facts to find out.
, or squeeze, prey? They loop their bodies around the prey and tighten their muscles to kill the animals. Then they swallow them.
Only alligators are tough enough to eat adult giant snakes. Dont feel bad for the snakes, though. They eat alligators!
Female pythons can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The snakes stay on the eggs for two to three months to keep them warm until they hatch.
What are other ways U.S. officials could stop the snakes?

Martin Luther King, Jr., at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On January 16, Americans will honor a great leaderMartin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968). This year is the 20th anniversary of the King holiday.
As a leader, King took action to improve his community. When he was growing up in the South, black people did not have the same rights as white people. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches. As a result of his work, lawmakers passed
Those laws protect the rights of all Americans.
King encouraged others to work together to make the world a better place. He once said, ""Everybody can be great because everybody can serve."" By taking part in community service projects, Americans keep Kings dream alive.

222,200,"If you are mailing thank-you notes after the holiday season, each note will cost you a penny more. Starting this month, the U.S. Postal Service has increased the price of first-class stamps to 34 cents. The one-penny increase will raise about $2.5 billion (that's eight zeroes!) for the U.S. Postal Service.

223,728,"The Hispanic American population tops 50 million.
eres looking at you! The countrys population is becoming bigger and more
or different, than ever before. There are now more than 308 million people
or living, in the United States. Many of them come from different countries and backgrounds.
More than 50 million of those people are
Those are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Only about 35 million Hispanic Americans lived in the United States 10 years ago.
The new numbers are from the nations
That is an official count of a countrys population. The U.S. census takes place every 10 years. U.S. officials recently announced the 2010 census results.
The Asian American population grew the fastest of all races, the count showed. That group increased by 43 percent from 2000 to 2010. There are now about 14.7 million Asian Americans in the nation.
Kids are a big reason the country is getting more diverse, officials say. Nearly half of all children [are] something other than non-Hispanic white, Stacy Vidal told
She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Census Bureau.
The census didnt just track who lives in the United States. It also showed
people live. California, New York, and Texas still have the biggest populations. About one-fourth of Americans live in those three states, the count found.
States in the South and West saw most of the population growth over the past 10 years. Nevadas population grew the fastest. It went up by 35 percent since 2000.
The census can teach us a lot about the United States, Vidal says. It paints a picture of who we are as a nation.
The United States has seen a big jump in the Hispanic American population over the past 40 years. This graph shows how that groups numbers have grown. What do you think its population will be in 2020? Why?
Why might U.S. officials want to know how many people live in the country?

224,663,"School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school.
As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are being bounced around. A new study shows that about 17,000 accidents occur on school buses each year. Injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers report that crashes aren't causing all of those injuries. Kids are sometimes thrown around when buses stop and turn. Some people say those injuries could be prevented if school buses had seat belts.
Traffic safety experts say seat belts would not
or lower, injuries. Not all injuries occur when kids are in their seats. Nearly one-quarter of injuries occur when kids are getting on and off the buses.
School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, says the National School Transportation Association. The number of kids injured is only a small fraction of the nearly 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year.

229,695,"Get ready to sing Happy Birthday! On July 9, a new nation will be born.
That country may be called the Republic of South Sudan. It is in Africa. Earlier this year, southern Sudans people voted to become an
or free, country. They recently announced the results of the election.
The future nation is currently part of Sudan. That is the largest country in Africa. More than 2 million people in southern Sudan voted to
from northern Sudan. To separate is to pull apart.
The north and the south had been at war on and off for more than 50 years. Most people in the north follow a religion called Islam (iss-LAHM). People in the south practice Christianity and other religions. Some of the fighting happened because Sudans government tried to make people in the south follow Islams rules.
Soon, southern Sudans people will govern themselves. It wont be easy, world leaders say. The area is very poor. More than half of southern Sudans population lives on less than $1 a day. Many people do not have access to clean water.
A man works on an oil rig in southern Sudan.
The young nation will be rich in one thing, thoughoil. Southern Sudan produces about 375,000 barrels of oil a day. The south used to share its oil money with the north. Now it will keep the money and pay the north to help move the oil.
Southern Sudans leaders are hopeful about the future. We are a ... nation that has just been born, says official Pagan Amum. And like a human baby, we are
[or weak] but have the [chance] to become great.
247,105 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
7.5 million to 9.7 million people (about the same size as New Jersey)
What challenges might southern Sudan face? Why?

232,347,"Popcorn is the official state snack food of Illinois.
Its light. Its fluffy. It pops. What is it? Popcorn! And now, it is also the official state snack food of Illinois.
The idea to honor popcorn came from a group of second and third graders. They called themselves the ""Kernel Kids.""
The kids invited a state senator to their school to tell him about their idea. The senator thought it was good and told other officials about the idea. In August, the governor of Illinois signed the popcorn bill. At the ceremony, the guests ate popcorn. The students wore popcorn hats that they had made.

Sydney came up with the idea to put the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today"" on blue wristbands. She and her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, sold the wristbands in their New Jersey community. After only a month, they had sold 10,000!
Soon after, the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York began selling the wristbands on its Web site. The bands became an even bigger hit! ""We made over $100,000 already,"" Sydney told

234,155,"February is the month in which millions of Americans celebrate African American history. Many important events in African American history took place in February.
For example, Rosa Parks was born during this month. In 1955, Parks was arrested when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. In some places at that time, it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus.
of, or refusal to use, the bus company. Many blacks refused to ride the city buses for more than a year, until those unfair laws were changed.
In 1926, the historian Carter G. Woodson declared a week honoring black history. He chose the February week with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.

or extends, 70 feet beyond the canyon's edge.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon, in Arizona, was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. Looking down from the skywalk, people can see the canyon floor 4,000 feet below.
The Hualapai (WAH-luh-pie) Indians, who live near the Grand Canyon National Park, allowed the structure to be built. Some tribe members hope the skywalk encourages tourists to visit the natural wonder. The glass walkway can hold the weight of a few hundred people, says architect Mark Johnson. Hualapai leaders and two former astronauts were the first people to set foot on the new skywalk.

dont look like cartoonsthey look like real owls! That was the goal of Grant Freckelton and Simon Whiteley. They are
who worked on the new movie. An animator creates art for movies.
student reporter Jackson Brantley talked with the animators.
Jackson Brantley: What is your favorite part of the movie?
We like [the] cool owls that have helmets and battle gear.
JB: How did you create the characters?
[We found photographs of] real owls. We [changed each owl] enough so that it [showed] what the character is like. We tried to make [the main character] sort of wide-eyed.
JB: What do you love most about your job?

239,455,"U.S. President Barack Obama wants to bring our country up to speed.
That is technology that allows computers to link to the Internet without using wires. About two-thirds of U.S. homes have wireless Internet. The president hopes to bring the technology to the rest of Americans.
Having wireless Internet could change how schools and businesses run, Obama says. The technology could help kids finish their schoolwork from home, he recently explained. Also, firefighters could quickly download information on their way to burning buildings.
The plan will go to Congress for approval. If it passes, Obama will work to bring wireless Internet to towns that dont have it. He will also build a special wireless network for police and other emergency workers.
This isnt just about faster Internet, Obama says. Its about connecting every corner of America.

240,713,"Mexico's ""Volcano of Fire"" roars back to life. When will the next big explosion occur?
The Colima (koh-LEE-mah) Volcano in Mexico has roared to life again. The 12,500-foot volcano is also called the ""Volcano of Fire."" Over the past few months, its eruptions have been larger and more frequent. It has been shooting hot gas and ash high into the sky.
The Volcano of Fire is Mexico's most
volcano. It has erupted many times over the years. What scientists are most worried about is the next big eruption. The volcano has had huge eruptions about every hundred years. The last one took place in 1913.
Scientists have noticed a pattern in recent activity that is very much like the pattern before the 1913 eruption. ""Most scientists are expecting a large, explosive eruption in the next 10 years or so,"" volcano expert Jim Luhr told
The volcano is 20 miles north of the city of Colima. To make sure no one is in danger, officials created a safety zone around the volcano. People aren't allowed in that area.
Scientists use special equipment to track changes within the volcano. ""We're looking for clues of another large, explosive eruption,"" says Luhr. ""That way, we can be prepared.""

241,329,"Which famous African American do you most admire?
asked some third graders at Tamarac Elementary School in Holtsville, New York, that question. Here's what they said:
Jackie Robinson in a Kansas City Monarchs Uniform.
I admire Jackie Robinson. It must have been tough being the first African American to play major-league baseball. He wasn't treated equal. Instead of getting angry, Jackie Robinson showed how good he was. He made the Hall of Fame!
Rosa Parks was a very brave woman. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. She helped change the laws in our country by standing up for what she believed in.
Hockey player Anson Carter is whom I admire. He has proved to be a decent power forward for the New York Rangers. He always gives 100 percent. That will help the Rangers make their drive for the playoffs.

242,214,"On March 27, hundreds of colorful kites will fill the sky over the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., where a kite festival will be held. Nearly 25,000 people attend the popular event each year. This year's theme is ""Kites Around the World.""
""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told
. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the
together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions.
Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials.""
Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away.
Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style.""
The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds.
Why is learning about different cultures important?

243,787,"The planet Mercury recently had a special visitor. It was a robot named
. The flying robot was the first spacecraft to travel near the planet in more than 30 years.
flew within 125 miles of Mercury's surface. The spacecraft took more than 1,200 photographs of the planet. Before, scientists had pictures of less than half of Mercury's surface.
will pass the planet in October 2008 and again in September 2009. Then the robot will spend a year
the planet. To orbit is to travel in a path around an object.
Scientists hope studying Mercury will show how the planets formed. ""We really need better information on Mercury to make sure that our ideas on how the Earth and sister planets formed [are correct],"" says researcher Sean Solomon.

244,45,"Scientists used the satellite to count different types of animals at the Bronx Zoo.
As the tallest animals in the world, giraffes have a great view of the zoo. Scientists recently had an even better view--from 280 miles above Earth! Animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were tracked from outer space with a
. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon.
of zoo animals and sent the images back to Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals that are alike in certain ways. Scientists studied the images to see how well the satellite could spot different species.
The Bronx Zoo is located in New York City.
So far, scientists are pleased with the results. They hope to use the satellite to track
animals in faraway places in the wild. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming
, or dying out completely. Currently, people track animals either by foot or by airplane. Scientists think that using a satellite to track animals will be both easier and cheaper.
""Taking a count is the first step in finding out if a species is in danger of extinction,"" scientist Scott Bergen told
Along with counting endangered animals, scientists want to learn where they
. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Why do scientists want to learn where animals migrate? ""[We want to know where to] create national parks and other protected areas for endangered animals,"" said Bergen.

245,343,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Does your backpack ever feel as if it's filled with bricks? If so, you are not alone. Many kids tend to overload their backpacks.
A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad
(POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk.
Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert.
What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!

Thousands of kids put their art skills to the test. They entered the Pier 1/UNICEF/ Weekly Reader greeting card contest. The winners were Adam Carr, 6, from Florida and Anna Hall, 12, from Colorado.
Adams and Annas drawings were made into greeting cards. Money earned from the sale of the cards will be used to help needy kids.

247,675,"Scientists are purring over the latest panther news. The cats are slowly making a comeback.
or very, endangered species. Fifteen years ago, only about 25 of the adult cats were left in the wild. Today, there are more than 100.
Scientists helped the panthers by starting a special breeding program. They moved eight cougars to Florida. Cougars and panthers are both types of mountain lions.
The panthers and cougars had healthy babies together. In fact, todays Florida panthers are bigger and stronger than their grandparents.
The baby boom doesnt mean the panthers are in the clear, though. A population of 100 is still not [workable] in the long term, says scientist David Onorato. [This] is a project thats going to have to be done again.

, or busy, hurricane season? Warm water and wind, says Gerry Bell. He is one of the governments top hurricane
. A forecaster uses information to predict what will happen.
This year, the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than it usually is. That helps whip up more storms. Warm water provides a lot of moisture for hurricanes, Bell told
The current wind conditions are also perfect for storms, he says. Stronger hurricanes form when the speed and direction of wind is the same along much of the East Coast of the United States.
The worst of the storms may be over soon. Usually by mid-October, [they] dont really affect the United States anymore, Bell says.

Nobody likes to get a teasing e-mail. Especially if you dont know whom the mean message is from.
You never know if its your best friend or your worst enemy, one elementary school student explains.
Teasing or bothering other kids online is called
. Experts say its a growing problem. A recent survey of 1,500 students found that one in every four kids had been bullied online more than once.
In person, bullies can bother other kids only when adults arent watching. Cyberbullies can go after kids anytime. Some send hurtful e-mails. Others might use classmates passwords to log in to their computer game accounts. Then they steal their points.
[Victims] cant get away from [the bullying], Parry Aftab told
. Aftab is the founder of a Web site that helps people who have been mistreated online. [The bullying] follows them to camp. It follows them to the mall. Its where they are.
To protect kids, some companies are introducing software products to
, or watch, their Internet use. A group of teens from around the world also wants to stop online bullying. The teens are researching ways unknown bullies can be
Aftab says kids also should be aware of their own behavior online. They should try not to hurt other peoples feelings. She says, Dont [say] anything online that you wouldnt [say] off-line.
Are you being teased by a cyberbully? Heres what to do if someone is bothering you online:
Tell your parents or another adult you trust.
Dont open messages or e-mails from bullies.
Save bullies messages and show them to an adult.
Why should kids be careful about what they say and do online?

250,164,"Two girls in Sri Lanka walk past the rubble that was once their school. It was destroyed in the
(soo-NAH-mee), or series of huge waves, that hit South Asia in December.
The tsunami destroyed thousands of buildings, including homes, stores, and schools.
Since then, temporary schools have been set up in buildings that are still standing and in tents. The girls, along with thousands of other students, can now return to school.
""The opening of these schools is a powerful sign for people that life can begin again,"" said Carol Bellamy, the director of UNICEF. That is a group that helps children in need. UNICEF and other groups have donated thousands of tents and school supplies to countries affected by the tsunami.
A tsunami is usually caused by an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption. The recent tsunami smashed against the coasts of 12 countries in South Asia and East Africa. Tens of thousands of people were killed. Millions of others were left homeless.
This map shows the countries in South Asia and East Africa where the tsunami hit. They are shown in yellow.
Since the disaster, the world has reached out to help people rebuild their lives. Officials predict that it could take up to 10 years to help the region recover from the tsunami.
What are some other ways that schools can rebuild?
Returning to school is helping students focus on rebuilding their lives. ""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Bellamy.

252,416,"Nine-year-old Aubrie LeClair of Connecticut is often busy at her computer. Like a lot of kids today, she uses the computer to type her schoolwork and learn new things.
By third grade, many kids know how to type on a keyboard. That has some handwriting experts worried. They are afraid that computers will replace cursive writing in the future.
""[The kids have] good handwriting now, and they love cursive,"" said one teacher from California. ""But it wouldn't surprise me if they just walked around with their little keyboards and typed everything a few years from now.""
Third grade is the year when most kids learn how to write in cursive. However, many kids like Aubrie say they would rather type than write in cursive. ""Computers are better. [They don't] make my hand cramp up as much,"" said Aubrie.
No one knows what will become of cursive writing. In the meantime, keep practicing. For the time being, it seems that cursive is sticking around.

255,335,"Asian elephants are running out of space and time. Their
or the place where they usually live, has been shrinking. Scientists warn that Asian elephants could disappear if nothing is done to help them.
In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food.
Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100.
Scientists for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say there are about 35,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. That is a
or drop, from the 100,000 Asian elephants that were in the wild in 1900.
The map shows Asian countries. Elephants in these countries, scientists warn, are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out.
11 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 to 10 feet tall at the shoulder (male)
9 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
8 feet tall at the shoulder (female)
Most males have tusks. If present, female tusks are small.
The WWF is an organization that works to save endangered animals. According to a recent WWF report, many Asian elephants are being killed for their meat, skin, and ivory tusks.
Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF scientist, says that world governments should set aside land for Asian elephants. Efforts to save the Asian elephants are important, she says, because the elephants belong ""not only to Asia, but all the world's people.""
More people live in Asia than on any other continent. How might that affect the Asian elephant population?

257,739,"Two eyes peer through the thick leaves and branches of a tree. The eyes belong to a 400-pound lowland gorilla that lives in Africa's Congo Basin. That is home to the second-largest rain forest in the world.
The world's entire population of lowland gorillas live in the Congo Basin. Those creatures are among many species of endangered animals living in the rain forest.
The gorilla is one of the endangered animals living in the Congo Basin.
Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting.
Gorillas are plant eaters. They also like to eat insects, such as termites and ants. An adult male eats about 40 pounds of food each day!
Young gorillas love to play. They learn new skills by imitating adult gorillas.
Each gorilla has a unique nose print. Scientists can identify a gorilla by the shape of its nose.
Help is on the way for the rain forest and the animals that live there. The presidents of 10 African countries recently signed a
, or agreement, to protect the rain forest.
""The treaty is important because it shows that the governments are committed to protecting the Congo Basin,"" World Wildlife Fund (WWF) scientist Richard Carroll told
The WWF is a group that protects endangered animals and habitats. The WWF is helping Africa's governments stop illegal hunting and set up parks and protected areas for animals. ""This gives us a great opportunity to save the forest,"" said Carroll.
Do you think people should be responsible for protecting animals and habitats? Why?

258,283,"Cave lions were the biggest lions that ever lived. Some were 11 feet long.
Mammoths had tusks that could grow up to 13 feet long.
Woolly rhinos weighed 2 to 3 tons. That's as heavy as a minivan!
Thousands of years ago, giant creatures roamed a frozen land. Scientists recently unearthed, or dug up, fossils of some of those creatures.
While working at a gravel pit in England, Ray Davies made an amazing discovery. He found the huge skull of a woolly rhino in the bucket of his digging machine. Woolly rhinos were large animals that became
After hearing about the discovery, scientists went to the gravel pit to get the skull. They looked in the pit for other
. Fossils are ancient remains of animals and plants. Scientists found many of the rhino's other bones. ""This is the best example of a woolly rhino I have ever seen,"" said scientist Andy Currant.
Scientists later found the bones of three other woolly rhinos. In addition, scientists found the bones of a woolly mammoth, bison, reindeer, wild horse, and wolf. Scientists also found the remains of insects and plants.
The fossils date back to a period of time called the Ice Age. That period started almost 2 million years ago. It ended around 10,000 years ago. During the Ice Age, snow and ice covered much of Earth.
At the end of the Ice Age, some animals survived. Other animals, like the woolly rhino, became extinct. The new fossils are clues to the past. They will help scientists learn more about the Ice Age.

259,154,"Adriana Valencia has a new look--a short haircut! The fifth grader from Montrose, California, donated her long hair to Wigs for Kids. Wigs for Kids is a charity that helps children who have lost their hair because of illnesses.
recently talked to Adriana about her donation.
Adriana, what made you decide to donate your hair?
I grew my hair out to 12 inches. I wanted to do something for kids who had lost their hair. My cousin had leukemia, so I know what it's like for some kids [who lose their hair].
How can kids help other kids who have lost their hair besides by donating their own hair?
I think kids might get involved by learning more about cancer and seeing how it affects kids and their families.

265,626,"U.S. cities jump on the bicycle path.
A bicycle boom is headed to a city near you! More Americans than ever are hitting the road on two-wheelers.
About 1.7 million U.S. residents use bicycles as their
or main, way to get around. The number of riders has nearly doubled since 2000. That is according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The spike in bikes may be thanks to the work of U.S. cities. From San Francisco to Boston, cities are becoming more bicycle-friendly. Some towns are adding more bike lanes. That makes
easier for cyclists. To commute is to travel regularly from one place to another, such as school or work.
Officials are adding more bike lanes in Washington, D.C.
the length of traffic lights. To alter is to change. That helps riders stay safe. Longer lights give them more time to cross busy streets. The nations capital also has a bike-sharing program. Riders can borrow bicycles at one location. Then they can return them in another part of town.
U.S. officials hope the new projects mean people will use their bicycles more and their cars less. Fewer cars on the road can help cut pollution. Thats because driving cars gives off harmful gases.
Riding bicycles helps more than just the environment, though. Cycling is a great way for people to stay active and fit, explains Meghan Cahill. She is a spokesperson for the League of American Bicyclists.
Cities will continue to increase their bike-friendliness, she told
Officials realize that bicycle-friendly cities [have] healthier and happier citizens.
Take a spin around the map to learn about some U.S. cycling programs.
Note: Alaska and Hawaii are not shown.
A program in Portland donates bicycles to people who cannot afford to buy their own.
More than 30 schools in Boulder encourage students to walk or cycle to school along safe paths.
Houston has set up 345 miles of bike paths so that people can cycle to school and work.
Lawmakers are working to add more bicycle lanes in New York City and the rest of the state.
What are some other ways people commute to school or work?

266,130,"Chew on this! Your school cafeteria may be getting a makeover. Members of the U.S. government are trying to pass a new law. It would make school foods healthier. Under the plan, school cafeterias would serve meals with ingredients that are better for you. Vending machines, such as the one below, would also sell healthy snacks.
The idea is part of First Lady Michelle Obamas plan. She hopes to end childhood
That is the condition of being very overweight. About one-third of kids in the United States are too heavy, according to a study. Kids who are overweight are at a higher risk of having health problems.
If the law passes, schools would make kids foods healthier. Pizza, for example, might be made with low-fat cheese. [This bill] will help us [give] healthier school meals to children across America, says Obama.

269,13,"Allergies are on the rise in the United States.
! Youve probably been hearing those sounds a lot. Why?
are increasing in the United States. Those are bad reactions to things around you or that you eat.
More than half of Americans are now sensitive to at least one
Thats the finding of one of the most recent surveys by the National Institutes of Health. Allergens are things that set off allergies. Many allergenssuch as dust and moldare found in the air.
Allergies [are] increasing over time, says Andy Nish. He is a doctor from Georgia.
Allergens in the air arent the only problem. Kids food allergies have risen too. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of kids with food allergies jumped 18 percent. Eating milk products and eggs can give some children rashes. Those foods can even cause some people to have trouble breathing.
Whats behind allergies spread? Some scientists think our
dont have enough to do. Immune systems help our bodies fight germs. But kids today come in contact with fewer germs than their grandparents did. Thats in part because more medicine is available. Experts say that when our immune systems have fewer germs to fight, they can get confused. They attack other things, such as milk, instead.
Other scientists say hotter temperatures are to blame. They say the weather is warmer for longer periods now, so plants bloom longer. Plants release pollen (left), which is a common allergen.
Doctors do not know for sure whats making allergies increase. But they do know how to treat them with medicine. There is very good treatment for allergies, Nish says. No one should suffer with symptoms.
Dust and other allergens that float into your nose are in for a blasta cough or a sneeze, that is! Both are natural
, or responses, to help keep you from getting sick. Heres a look at the big bursts.
Sneezes start at the back of your throat. Each quick burst can force out up to 40,000 droplets of saliva. The tiny droplets travel at up to 300 miles per hour.
Coughs come out of your lungs. Each blast can push out 3,000 saliva droplets as fast as 50 miles per hour. Enough air comes out to almost fill a 2-liter bottle.
What might be some other reasons for the rise in allergies?

270,774,"When Dan Shaw and Cuddles go out, they attract quite a crowd. At first glance, Cuddles may look like a guide dog. But she is actually a miniature guide horse!
Cuddles and Shaw, who is blind, have been together since 2001. As a guide horse, Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he needs to go. Cuddles wears tiny sneakers that prevent her from slipping.
The Guide Horse Foundation in North Carolina trained Cuddles. She responds to more than 25 voice commands, including ""wait"" and ""door."" ""We are a good team,"" said Shaw.

If you are what you eat, then students at MacGregor Elementary School are fresh fruits and vegetables!
Kids at the school in Houston chow down on everything from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They grow all the food themselves in a school garden. Then they
the fruits and veggies and turn them into healthy meals. To harvest is to collect.
The students got their green thumbsand their appetites for fresh foodfrom the Recipe for Success Foundation. That group teaches kids about the food they eat. We make good food fun, says Gracie Cavnar, the groups founder.

 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called

275,232,"Animals get a new home at the National Zoo.
You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October.
Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild.
Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo.
""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016.""
Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year.
The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China.
Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design.
The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail.
Giant panda cub Tai Shan relaxes while chewing bamboo at the zoo.
Red pandas use their bushy tails to cover their bodies when they're cold.
Is it important for zoos to create homes that are like the animals' natural habitats? Why or why not?

277,72,"Tough Talkin'!: Discussing Bullies and Other Problems
It's not easy being a kid. That's what a recent national survey of kids and parents revealed. Bullying and violence at school are just some of the problems facing many kids today. How can kids cope with such tough issues?
""Tough issues are facing kids at younger ages,"" said Tina Hoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The group is a children's health organization. The foundation, Children Now (a children's research group), and Nickelodeon asked children ages 8 to 15 and parents to point out the tough issues kids deal with every day.
The survey, called Talking With Kids About Tough Issues, found that
about seven out of ten kids say bullying and teasing are problems at their school.
about four out of ten kids say kids at their school face threats of violence.
about seven out of ten kids in the survey say they are too embarrassed about their problems to talk to parents.
Other issues children say are problems at school include smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using drugs.
The survey found that when parents talk early about tough issues, kids learn to trust them more. Those kids who learn to talk to parents learn how to deal with problems that bother them.

species, such as cats and dogs. A mammal is a warm-blooded animal that feeds its babies milk. Experts found that all the species have become heavier over time.
Some creatures owners may be partly to blame for their pets increase in size, say researchers. People may feed their animals more unhealthy foods today than they did in the past.
Other animals extra pounds, however, are harder to explain. Animals some scientists study, such as mice and rats, have also grown bigger. [Those creatures] have been getting almost the exact same type of food over the past few [years], scientist David Allison told
Experts will continue to research the animals to learn more. This study lays out a puzzle, says Allison. There may ... be other important causes of obesity that we do not usually consider.

Erik Uebelacker has caught the writing bug! It all began in the second grade. Thats when the student from Bel Air, Maryland, learned a fun fact about butterflies.
They taste with their feet, Erik told
I was surprised when I heard that, so I decided to [write about it].
Write he did. Today, Erik, 10, is the author of a book. The book is called
The fifth grader has sold more than 700 copies of his book. Erik has donated the $3,100 in
he made to a wildlife group that protects endangered animals. Profits are earnings.
Because of his efforts, Erik was recently chosen as one of the top kid volunteers in the country. He was picked by an awards program. It is called the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.
Erik became interested in butterflies funny feet in science class. He learned that the fliers have taste
in their feet. An organ is a body part. When the butterflies stand on leaves, their feet taste them. If the leaves taste good, the critters will lay their eggs on them.
In Eriks book, butterflies that wear shoes taste only shoes. Everything might taste like dirty socks to them, he explains.
or print, another book. If he does, the young writer says, he will continue to give away his earnings. My favorite part about writing is donating the money ... to a good cause, Erik says. I just feel inspired.
What cool tricks do butterflies have up their wings? Read to learn more about the critters.
Butterflies can see green, red, and yellow. They can also spot things humans cant, such as patterns on flowers.
Butterflies may look colorful, but parts of their wings are clear. The wings are covered in scales.
Some butterfly species can fly to heights of 10,000 feet. Most species fly about 12 miles per hour.
Why might some people want to donate money instead of keeping it for themselves?

280,258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

282,214,"A ""cat-tastrophe"" recently struck the airport near Providence, Rhode Island. Airport officials were forced to cancel a flight when they found a runaway cat named Muffy sitting in the airplane's wheel well, the place where the landing gear is stored during flight.
The wayward cat had been placed in a cage to be put aboard an airplane. But somehow Muffy escaped and climbed into the wheel well of a nearby plane.
Airport workers spent hours trying to coax the cat down from its hiding place. They even offered Muffy some tasty treats.
Finally, after seven hours, the workers removed panels from the plane's wing and pulled Muffy to safety. Muffy, the runway runaway, was then reunited with her family.

283,583,"Germany, Chile, and Liberia elect their first female leaders.
Germany, Chile, and Liberia dont seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history.
But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history.
Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge.
Johnson-Sirleaf vows to unite Liberia and create jobs.
The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce
or joblessness, in her country. ""We want to give people hope of having jobs,"" she says.
As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countrys rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer.""
Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberias first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war.
Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs.
or bring back together, her country. ""I am excited by the potential of what I representthe aspirations and expectations of women in Liberia, African women, and women all over the world,"" she said in her inauguration speech.
Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll.
Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election.

284,670,"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.

285,802,"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea.

286,339,"Some experts question rewarding reading with pizza.
Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting
But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company. ""Schools need to realize that they are undermining their students' well-being,"" says nutrition expert Jane Levine. She explains that the Book It program is a problem not just because it rewards kids with fast food but also because it makes a large company a regular part of the school day.

287,669,"One morning in February, 75,000 kids woke up to find that they had become U.S. citizens. The kids, who were all adopted from other countries, became citizens because of the Child Citizenship Act.
The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

288,336,"On her TV show, Judge Judy Sheindlin makes difficult decisions concerning the cases she hears. Now the judge has written a book that aims to help kids make tough decisions.
You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover
, the judge presents situations that kids might find themselves in at school. She then offers some solutions but lets kids make their own decisions.
talked with Judge Judy. Here is what she had to say about her TV show and her book.
: How did you come up with the situations in your book?
Judge Judy: I developed them from real-life situations. I'm a grandmother. I asked my grandkids about the situations. I also tried to relate to kids and let them know that what they do now will affect them in their adult lives. This advice will, I hope, help them make the right choices.
: Compared to the past, are things different for kids today?
: Today, we live in a society that has both parents working. Working parents don't always spend enough time with their kids. Kids need parents who talk to them.
: How did you come up with the title for your book?
: Titles say a lot. You can't judge life by its cover. You shouldn't judge people by their covers--how they look or how they dress. You wouldn't want people to do that to you.
: What's the one piece of advice you would give to fourth graders?
: You should always think about what the right thing to do is--not what feels good, not what your friends are doing. If you think about what the right thing to do is, then eventually the right thing happens, and you sleep better at night.
: Your dog is pictured on the cover of your book. What's its name?

289,246,"Explorer Brge Ousland likes challenges. He currently holds four polar records. He set his last record in 1997 when he became the first person to walk across Antarctica without help.
Now Ousland is taking on a new challenge. At the end of February, he was scheduled to begin a 1,100-mile Arctic trek from Siberia to Canada via the North Pole. Siberia is a region of eastern Russia.
If successful, Ousland will be the first person to cross the top of the world alone and without help. Although he was not sure how long the trip would take, the explorer planned to pull a 340-pound sled with food and supplies for 90 days.
""This is the last classic challenge when it comes to expeditions in the polar areas,"" Ousland said. ""I have wanted to do this for a long time.""

290,209,"Pilots follow monarchs on the move from Canada to Mexico.
Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings.
This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an
Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch.
or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

291,517,"Meet a monkey with a Mohawk! Scientists recently discovered the unusual-looking creature with spiked hair in the mountains of Tanzania, a country located in East Africa. It is Africa's first new
or type, of monkey to be identified in 20 years.
The long-tailed, tree-dwelling monkey is a highland mangabey (MANG-guh-bee). It is covered with brownish-gray fur and has an off-white belly and tail. The new monkey makes an odd ""honk-bark"" call.
This latest discovery has surprised scientists. ""The chances of finding a large, noisy monkey that no one has ever scientifically described before makes this a rare event indeed,"" says scientist Trevor Jones.
Highland mangabeys are shy creatures. Their shyness makes them difficult to spot. That might explain why scientists were unaware that the species had existed. Another reason is that the monkeys live high in the forest
Scientists are working hard to protect the highland mangabey's environment. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys live in the wild. Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa.

292,789,"Richard Rodriguez recently set a new world's record for riding a roller coaster. He rode a coaster for 2,000 bone-rattling hours. That's about 22,655 miles.
To set the record, Rodriguez (front) rode a roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, an amusement park in England, for 22 hours a day for 90 days. After setting the record, Rodriguez said, ""It was a small step for me, but a giant roller coaster ride for mankind.""

293,706,"For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two!
Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface.
Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer.
The pie chart shows the two most abundant gases in Earth""s atmosphere.
Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists.
Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s.
Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. Ozone protects Earth from dangerous solar rays.
2. The largest ozone hole formed in 2000.
3. The ozone hole split in two.

294,303,"This summer, when 'N Sync took the stage at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Morgan Oseiki was there. The 9-year-old told
that the group did more than ""Bring in' Da Noise."" The members of the band talked about the dangers of illegal drugs.
Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs.
Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign.
As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Here's what some kids said their anti-drugs are:
Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin.

295,141,"Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

297,11,"As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are getting bounced around. A new study, published in the medical journal
shows that about 17,000 school busrelated accidents occur each year. Thats more than double previous estimates. Those injuries range from cuts to broken bones.
Researchers reported that crashes arent causing all those bumps and bruises. Slips and falls, getting jostled during stops and turns, and roughhousing are other ways kids get hurt. Nearly one-quarter of those injuries occur when kids are getting on and off buses.
Though the numbers are higher than thought, they represent a small fraction of kids. There are about 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, according to the National School Transportation Association.
The results may prompt stronger arguments for requiring safety belts on buses. But not all safety experts agree. Seat belts wouldnt reduce injuries and wouldnt be worth the added expense for school districts, says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

298,456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

299,369,"For many years, parents in Honduras have been giving their children unusual first names. Some parents in the Central American country have given their children such names as Bujia, which means ""Spark Plug,"" or Llanta de Milagro, which means ""Miracle Tire."" Other parents have named their children after famous American presidents. For example, one kid's first name is Bill Clinton, and another kid's name is Ronald Reagan.
Now, a government committee in Honduras wants parents to stop giving their children such unusual names. The committee worries that some kids could tease those kids with uncommon names. ""Without a doubt,"" the committee said, ""such names are a bother to the people who have to carry them through life.""

300,408,"Live from New York ... except this time, it wasn't! Pop singer Ashlee Simpson, the younger sister of singer Jessica Simpson, was caught
Lip-synching is mouthing the words or singing along to a recording. Some performers sing along to a prerecorded track to make their voice sound stronger.
A computer glitch was to blame for Simpson's mix-up on
. Simpson, 20, was caught lip-synching when the words to the wrong song began playing.
Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse.
""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do.""
An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts.
Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility.
Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance.
""[Lip-synching is ridiculous] and not entertaining in the least,"" a person commented online to NBC, the company that airs

302,661,"Take a time trip with tomorrows talking robots, dolphinlike boats, and more!
Thousands of kids recently had a sneak peek at the world of tomorrow. They experienced talking robots, underwater vehicles, and lifesize video games. These inventions were among the 150 creations at this years NextFest fair. The four-day festival was held in New York City, New York.
NextFest gave inventors a chance to unveil their latest creations. Many were right out of the lab. Others were still being developed. Here are a few of the high-tech gadgets that captured our attention.
Actroid is a robot designed to look and talk like a human.
Dont let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a
or humanlike, robot. She was designed to greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. Other versions of this robot are programmed to reply to hundreds of questions, such as ""What time is it?"" and ""Are you a real person?""
What is it like to live like a sea creature? The Bionic Dolphin gives people the chance to find out. The vehicle can cruise across the water at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour (mph) and then dive at least 10 feet. Its inventor, Thomas Rowe, designed the vehicle with wings to enable it to ""fly"" underwater as fast as 40 mph. ""The majority of my research was on dolphins, but where I got the most help was penguins and diving birds,"" Rowe told
The Bionic Dolphin was first designed for
or play. However, it may be used in the future to save whales entangled in nets. A larger version of the vehicle has been designed to rescue people lost at sea. ""It swallows them,"" says Rowe.
What combines music, rock climbing, and video games? Its a musical climbing wall called DigiWall. This climbing wall has interactive games based on speed, cooperation, and creativity. ""We wanted to do some kind of computer game where you are very physical,"" project leader Mats Liljedahl told
""We removed the computer screen, and instead we are using the lights and the grips."" The grips light up when they are touched.
Robonaut may help astronauts in future space missions. The robot is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot will ""perform tasks that up until now only astronauts could do,"" NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp told
Robonaut can operate on its own or be controlled by a human operator from Earth or in space. The operator would wear a special headset that displays live video from the cameras on the robots head. By wearing a glove with sensors, that person can control the actions of Robonauts fingers, which can hold tools as small as tweezers.
""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says
kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old was on the scene at NextFest. Along with checking out the latest gadgets, Michaela caught up with some inventors to learn more about their unique designs.
What was her favorite invention? Brainball! In this game, players wear headbands that monitor their stress levels by measuring brain waves. A computer directs a ball away from the player who is calmer.
""You needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponents circle,"" says Michaela. ""It is a good game for relieving stress.""

The eruption took place along the mid-ocean ridge, the most active volcanic region on Earth.
The crew made an amazing discovery! Chemicals from the vents attracted tiny organisms called bacteria.
Over time, scientists think that the bacteria will help tube worms grow in the area.
Later, crabs will come to feed on organisms, such as the tube worms, near the vents.
The dark zone of the ocean floor has no sunlight. The temperature there is almost freezing. Yet even after the eruption, living creatures are moving to this place to form a

304,438,"A new sports car is making waves. With the touch of a button, this convertible turns into a boat. It recently went for a test-drive, jetting along the Thames River in London, the capital of England.
Named the Aquada, the car can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour on land and about 30 miles per hour on water. The wheels pull into the car as soon as it hits water.
To avoid leaks, the car has no doors. Like a boat, the car requires drivers and passengers to climb over the side to get into it.
The new cars aren't cheap. One hundred are being built and will sell for $235,000 each at the end of the year.

305,324,"The results are in for the backpack survey. At the beginning of the school year, we asked you how much weight you carry in your backpack. Nearly 3,500 of you responded to our online poll.
Health experts recommend that kids not carry more than 15 percent of their body weight.
A 70-pound fourth grader, for example, should not carry a backpack that weighs more than 10.5 pounds. Take a look at the table to see how you compare with our kid respondents.

306,625,"Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.

307,409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

308,788,"Jonas Salk invented the vaccine that has almost wiped out polio.
Entire communities used to shut down each summer between 1930 and the early 1950s as families kept their kids indoors. Parents feared their children would be exposed to a disease called
. The disease crippled many people and sometimes caused death.
Thanks to Jonas Salk, polio has been almost wiped out worldwide. Salk was a doctor who invented a
to prevent the disease. Vaccines are shots or medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Salk's vaccine was officially declared safe on April 12, 1955. In honor of the 50th anniversary of that event, a new exhibit will open on April 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The exhibit is called ""Whatever Happened to Polio?""
disease. That means it can be passed easily from person to person. Polio can strike at any age but mainly affects kids.
The disease spreads when a virus attacks the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain that control muscles in the arms, legs, and stomach. It can
people, causing them to lose movement in different parts of their body.
The museum's exhibit will look at the history of polio and the development of the vaccine. Included among the objects to be displayed are the leg braces worn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease.
""The introduction of a successful polio vaccine in 1955 was one of the most significant events of the 20th century,"" said museum director Brent Glass.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world, it still threatens children in Africa and Southeast Asia. The new exhibit will focus on current efforts to
, or give vaccines to, children in those places.
One of the most famous victims of polio was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted polio and was confined to a wheelchair, although he was able to stand and take a few steps while wearing leg braces. The president declared a war on the disease. Exactly 10 years after his death, Salk's vaccine was announced officially safe.

309,19,"The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. It has nine justices. They are appointed for life by the president and approved by the Senate.
The Supreme Court rules whether federal, state, and local governments are following the written laws of the U.S. Constitution.
The Supreme Court hears only certain cases. Once the Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All other courts in the United States must follow the Supreme Court's decision in similar cases. This helps make sure that all Americans receive equal justice.

310,645,"A new fashion trend has hit some public schools across the country. More schools are requiring students to wear uniforms or are enforcing stricter dress codes.
Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Cincinnati, Ohio, said good-bye to jeans, T-shirts, and oversized, baggy clothes this school year. Instead, they must wear tan, navy, or black pants and shirts with a collar. Girls are also allowed to wear jumpers or skirts.
The students in Ohio are not alone. From California to New York, an estimated 11 million public schools
, or require, dress codes for students.
Some people support the idea of dress codes. School officials say that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen teasing and bullying. Students focus on schoolwork instead of fashion.
""I like uniforms,"" Brittany, a student at Lakeside, told
. ""No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing that they are.""
Some parents say that another benefit of wearing uniforms is that it saves money. They think uniforms are less expensive than designer clothes.
Not all people are in favor of dress codes. Some parents say that dress codes
, or go against, kids' freedom of expression. That right is guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
These students do not have to follow a dress code.
Others argue that dress codes take away their kids' creativity by preventing them from choosing what to wear. Maggie, a student at Lakeside, told
that she doesn't like to wear a uniform, because ""all the outfits are the same.""
Some parents don't agree that buying uniforms is less expensive. They say it can be costly to purchase clothes to meet dress codes.

311,627,"How hard will the flu hit this season? U.S. health officials aren't sure, but they fear the number of cases may be higher than usual.
There has been a shortage of flu
this year. A flu vaccine is a substance that helps fight the flu. Most people get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Others get it in the form of nose sprays.
This year, only two companies made flu vaccine for the United States. One of the two companies found that its supply, which was being made in England, was damaged. That company was supposed to provide the United States with half of the 100 million doses of flu vaccine expected.
. A virus is a tiny organism that makes people sick when it invades cells in the body and multiplies.
Flu season typically runs from November through March. Fever, a cough, a headache, and muscle aches are among the flu's many signs, or
There isn't a cure for the flu. Yet health officials say that the flu vaccine can help keep people from catching the bug. Scientists have to create a new flu vaccine each year. That is because the
, or type, of flu virus changes from year to year.
Due to the shortage of flu vaccine, the people at highest risk will get a flu shot first.
Because of the shortage, the people at highest risk will get the vaccine first. That group includes adults 65 and over, kids 6 to 23 months, and people with serious medical conditions. The vaccine was sent to doctors' offices that care for high-risk patients.
Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading:
Wash hands regularly with soap and warm water.
Use a tissue to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. If there isn't a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your sleeve. Using your hand may spread the germs.
Practice healthful habits, such as eating right, getting plenty of rest, and exercising.

312,613,"People in India are rebuilding their homes and lives after a powerful earthquake rocked a western section of their country on January 26. Indian officials say that the quake, which had a magnitude of 7.7, may have killed as many as 25,000 people.
The quake, which was the strongest to hit India in 50 years, left devastation and heartache in its wake. Initially, rescue workers had little hope of finding survivors under rubble from toppled buildings. However, miraculous rescues did occur. For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck.

313,349,"Would you spend a month in a small room with 2,700 scorpions? That's what a woman from Malaysia did recently. Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia.
Malena Hassan, age 24, set a record by living with a roomful of scorpions, which are poisonous, for 30 days.
During her monthlong ordeal, Hassan was stung seven times and as a result, suffered from a high fever.
But it was worth it, Hassan said after she set the new record. ""This is my dream come true. I am very happy and proud...to have accomplished this very difficult record"", she said.

314,714,"reported on a bill that would impose a 5-cent deposit on cigarettes sold in Maine. Members of a committee in the Maine legislature recently voted to snuff out the bill, making it unlikely that the bill will become law. If the bill had become law, it would have increased the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.
State Rep. Joseph Brooks, who introduced the bill, said he was disappointed by the vote. Brooks had proposed the bill to cut down on litter and to raise money to pay for antismoking education programs in Maine's schools. He also had hoped that the increased cost would have caused some smokers to stop smoking cigarettes.

315,52,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

316,284,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

317,182,"Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools?
If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.

According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their
, or loyalty to the country. ""Our school board has long supported [the pledge] as an appropriate patriotic exercise for willing students,"" says Steven Ladd, the superintendent from one of the California school districts affected by the ruling.
Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is
. Kids don't have to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.

318,350,"Where the Wild Things Are!: A Numbers Puzzle
Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test.
The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild.
After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest
of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count.
The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told
Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most
animals. That means there are very few left in the wild.
Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their
, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland.
Giant pandas must eat a lot of bamboo to get the nutrients they need. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo, because it is not very nutritious.
, or go into a long sleep, in the winter, because they can't store up enough fat on a bamboo diet.
A newborn panda weighs between 3 and 5 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter.
Each front paw on a panda has an extra wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help the panda grasp bamboo shoots.
Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick
Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day.
In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation.
To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas.
How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more
for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves.
""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too.""
Why is it important for scientists to track endangered animals?

319,418,"These fourth graders are switching classes like middle schoolers!
Some fourth and fifth graders are on the move. The students at Ottawa Elementary School in Buchanan, Michigan, are getting a sneak preview of middle school life. Theyre switching classesand teachersfour times a day.
So far, the program has been a big hit. ""The kids really like that theyre going to get up and move every 40 minutes,"" science teacher Sue Borr told
""They dont like sitting in the same place all day.""
Borr suggested the program, which is called team teaching. Instead of staying with one teacher all day, students go to four different classrooms, where they learn four different subjects. Those subjects are math, social studies, science, and language arts. The students begin and end the day with a homeroom teacher.
""I like it better because the teachers like what theyre teaching,"" says Ottawa fifth grader Michael Meersman. ""They have fun, and theyre not as grouchy.""
Unlike many elementary school students, these fourth and fifth graders dont leave their papers and supplies in a desk. They carry their work with them from class to class in three-ring binders and colored folders. ""Theyre really organized,"" adds Borr.
Fourth graders at Ottawa have another reason to like the program: They wont have to get used to a new teacher when school starts next September, because they will learn the same subjects from the same teachers.

Sometimes, disabilities limit the activities that people can do.
Ghana recently passed the Persons with Disability (PWD) Bill. The law helps provide disabled people with jobs, transportation, and medical care.
In Ghana, as in many poor countries around the world, people with disabilities are often forced to beg for food. But, even as a little boy, Yeboah refused to accept that fate. Instead, he dreamed of riding a bicycle across his country.
Four years ago, Yeboah rode a bicycle across Ghana. He traveled nearly 400 milesmore than the distance across Kansas! Since then, Yeboah has had an operation and has been fitted with an artificial leg. He has competed in sporting events around the world.
Today, Yeboah is a celebrity in Ghana. He runs a fund that helps disabled children in Ghana go to school. He also has built or bought more than 800 wheelchairs for other disabled people in his country.
""I want children to learn my story and do more than Ive done,"" Yeboah told
""I want kids to say, Emmanuel inspired me to do this!""

321,413,"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire.
Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water.
Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris.
The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins.
Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries.
Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens.
Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition.
Michael Mller-Karpe, a scientist who studies ancient Assyria, said, ""The Assyrian queens have just begun to speak to us, and we are looking forward to more answers.""
Mller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble.
""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur.
For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said.

322,478,"Snakehead fish and other invasive species threaten the environment.
Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of
that currently threaten environments in the United States.
An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack
in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area.
Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.
Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt
An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals that live together in the same area.
""Our natural ecosystems are the primary source of our food and drinking water,"" scientist Lisa Gould told
. ""Ecosystems help keep our air clean. They give us medicines. Without them, we could not exist for long.""

The young beetles chomp through the inner bark of ash trees, destroying the tunnels inside that move water from the roots to the leaves.
Coqui frogs have an appetite for Hawaii's insects and are leaving nothing for many endangered birds in the area. To hear these ear-piercing frogs, visit
Each year, a female zebra mussel can lay 30,000 to 100,000 eggs. When those eggs hatch, the baby mussels gobble up food and oxygen, leaving nothing for other underwater creatures.

323,793,"By now, everyone knows that cigarettes are
, which means people can develop a need for them that is very hard to get rid of. However, until recently, no studies had measured how addictive.
Cigarettes contain many chemicals, including a chemical called nicotine, which studies have proved is addictive.
For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks.
The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction. We need to take the problem of smoking and adolescents much more seriously than we have.""

324,261,"Manatees often graze in shallow waters off the coast of Florida. These seadwelling plant eaters play with divers and swimmers. The huge animals are often called sea cows because of their large size.
Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of
or dying out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000.
As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.

326,317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

327,189,"A Pennsylvania man collected more than one million pennies.
A Pennsylvania man got more than a penny for his thoughts. After 40 years of pinching (or saving) pennies, Lynn Wagner decided it was time to cash them in at the bank.
Wagner collected more than a million pennies in all. Over the years, he stored the pennies in 41 / 2-gallon buckets in his garage. After several bank visits to cash in 37 buckets of coins, Wagner came home with about $10,060 in paper money!
How did he become so penny-wise? ""I thought that it'd be interesting to have a million [pennies],"" he said.
According to Wagner, if all his pennies were stacked end to end, they would be 4,600 feet high. That is about four times as tall as the Empire State Building, in New York City.
Wagner admits that spending pennies is now hard for him to do. That could be because he knows how to make every penny count. As his wife points out, ""Some people think that pennies don't add up to anything, but this is proof that they do.""

328,498,"Sixth grader Haley Small loves to wear a T-shirt, flip-flops, and pajama bottoms. But Haley doesnt wear her comfy pjs just for sleeping or lounging around the house. She wears them in publiceven to school.
Whats the appeal of pajamas? ""Part of it is because its cute, but the majority of it is because its comfortable,"" says the 11-yearold from Glen Rock, New Jersey. Haley often wears her pajamas to school because theyre more comfortable than jeansand so she can sleep an extra five minutes in the morning.
Haley isnt the only student parading around in pajamas in public. Sleepwearin plaids, stripes, and animal printsis popping up in schools across the country.
Boys are also following the trend, wearing elastic-waist or drawstring pants topped with T-shirts. Some kids are even shuffling down the school hallways in their slippers!
Pajamas may be the latest fashion trend, but they are not popular with everyone. School officials from Michigan to California have banned bedtime clothes from class. Take a look at both sides of the pj debate.
Some supporters think that school officials are dreamingkids do not need to get dressed up to learn. People who are pro pajamas say a ban limits students freedom of expression and creativity.
Haley agrees that one day she may need to dress up, but right now pajamas are fine by her. She says that school isnt a job and that wearing pajamas suits her personality. ""Im not a very dressed-up person myself,"" she adds. ""If you found me in a skirt, that would be amazing.""
Many principals and teachers say that sleepwear has no place in school. They argue that kids go to school to learn, and the casual trend
, or takes attention away, from learning. Ohio school official Gene Harris says pajamas set a bad example because students who dress for play ""want to play.""
Principal Shelly Fagenstrom from Great Falls, Montana, agrees. She has banned pajama wearing at her school. ""This isnt a sleepover,"" says Fagenstrom. ""Its school.""

329,635,"The Sequel of Tut and His Treasures
Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""
King Tut and his treasures first visited the United States in the 1970s. That display attracted a whopping 8 million visitors. The new exhibit looks at what life was like for Tut and other
who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British
Howard Carter made one of history's greatest finds. An archaeologist is a person who digs up ancient ruins and studies the past. The long-lost tomb contained Tut's
, or preserved body. The mummy was buried inside three gold coffins within a
, or stone coffin. A mask of solid gold rested over the mummy's face.
Glistening riches filled King Tut's tomb. They included statues, jewelry, weapons, the king's golden throne and other furniture, and even childhood games. The ancient Egyptians believed in the
. They buried their dead with many items they believed could be used in life after death.
Although Tut's mask and mummy are too fragile to be removed from Egypt, some of Carter's other fascinating finds are on display in the latest exhibit. ""
"". One of the treasures, a wooden figure of the boy king, is the first object that visitors see when they enter the exhibit. In the darkened room, a light shines on the wooden figure. The figure is depicted without Tut's famous gold or jewels.
""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.
, or follow-up, exhibit different from the one that visited the United States in the 1970s? ""The first exhibit was about the discovery of the tomb,"" Silverman told
""This exhibition is about the life of the young kinghis family, his history, his responsibilities.""
The wealth of objects discovered in the young king's tomb leads scientists to wonder what might have been contained in the tombs of other pharaohs. Those tombs, unlike Tut's, were
, or robbed, long ago. As Silverman says, ""Egypt continues to fascinate.""
King Tut's showstopping exhibit includes more than 130
. An artifact is a human-made object. Only 13 of those artifacts were included in the last Tut tour in the 1970s. Most have never before left Egypt.
as a crown. The crown depicts a vulture and a cobra, for protection in the afterlife.
shaped like a falcon. The collar depicts Horus, the ancient Egyptian god of the sky.
in the shape of an ankh, an Egyptian symbol of life, was buried with Tut.
held Tut's liver, which Egyptians believed would be needed in the afterlife. Canopic jars are special containers used to hold the preserved organs of the dead. A peek inside shows rows of ancient Egyptian writing.
Why might King Tut's tomb have been the only royal burial chamber not damaged by thieves?

331,590,"Hawaiian monk seals may be headed for extinction.
Scientist Ken Longenecker is on a missionto figure out what is killing the Hawaiian monk seal. ""These guys are on the brink, honestly,"" he recently told reporters while sorting through a pile of stinky fish bones. The bones were all that remained from the meal of a monk seal.
The 600-pound animals are fast disappearing from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, their main
or natural home. Longenecker and other researchers think the seals are not getting enough food, and they are desperately trying to figure out why. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, the monk seal population plummeted. The major threats were habitat loss and deadly runins with fishing gear. Today, there are about 1,200 monk seals, but experts fear that the population will dip below 1,000 in the next five years. Although the seals habitat is now protected by law, their numbers have failed to rebound.
However, scientists are now looking at the seals diet in the hopes it will give them clues about how to save the animals. Part of Longeneckers job is to figure out what the animals are eating. Other scientists are also tracking monk seals and monitoring their habitat for pollution.

332,465,"Overfishing is harming the world's sea life.
Troubled waters are ahead for the world's fish. Those finned creatures and shellfish, such as crabs and clams, may be a rare sight by 2048, according to a fouryear study. The study, recently published in the journal
was conducted by a team of 14 researchers in four countries.
If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
The study warns that ocean life is being wiped out because of overfishing and pollution.
Global warming (a rise in Earth's temperatures) and habitat loss are also to blame for the decline in seafood.
Although the world's sea life is in serious danger, it's not too late to reverse the problem, says the study's lead author, Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. The researchers have called for measures to protect current fish populations, such as reducing large-scale fishing and pollution. ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we don't change things,"" Worm told reporters.
The loss of ocean life will cause more than just a shortage of seafood. It could spell disaster for ecosystems too. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that work together as a unit to live. A declining fish population would cause a disaster up and down the food chain. Larger animals, such as seals and dolphins, depend on fish for food. Without enough fish to eat, those animals would be in trouble.

333,362,"Some people get alligators and crocodiles mixed up. But they are very different. Here are a few of the differences between the two kinds of reptiles.
A crocodile has a pointed snout. The fourth bottom tooth on each side sticks out when the croc's mouth is closed.
An alligator has a broad, flat snout. It is not as fierce as a crocodile.

334,519,"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another.
President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives.""
By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California.
In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets.
""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time.""
The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a
, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner.
Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud.""

Since receiving her bionic ear four years ago, Lily has soared to the top of her class in reading and writing. For the past two years, she has taken violin lessons, and she hopes to land a spot in her school orchestra.
Lily lives with her family in Scotland, a country in Europe. Lily's future looks bright now, but that wasn't always the case. When Lily was born, she was very sick. Doctors treated her with medicine that saved her life but left her completely deaf.
Her brother Max, now 10, and her family learned sign language to communicate with Lily. After undergoing surgery for the implant, Lily learned to speak.
How does the bionic ear work? People hear when sound waves travel to a bone, called the

The bionic ear does a similar job. It helps sound

341,567,"The theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week is ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!""
Here's one message you never want to forget: ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which runs from October 5 through October 11.
For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:
. Every family should have a home escape route planned. As part of the plan, identify two ways out of every room, such as a door or window exit. Be sure your plan includes a meeting place outside that is a safe distance from your home. Practice the plan at least twice a year.
. Smoke alarms are often the first signal of a fire. Your home should have a smoke alarm on every level and in or close to each bedroom. Be sure an adult tests alarms monthly and replaces batteries once a year.
. Whenever the stove is on, make sure there is an adult in the room. Keep a ""kid-free zone"" about 3 feet around the stove.

The $10 bill is getting a new look! To outsmart counterfeiters, the U.S. government is rolling out a newly redesigned $10 bill that has splashes of red, yellow, and orange.
are people who try to make fake bills that look like the real ones. Counterfeiting is a crime.
""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure,"" says Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which produces all U.S. paper money.
The $10 bill is the latest in the series to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill was given a makeover in 2003.
There are several colorful changes on the new bill. A red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch appears next to the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. On the portrait's other side is the phrase ""We the People,"" also in bright red ink. The background is light orange, and small yellow 10s surround the torch. A new ink makes the numeral 10 in one of the corners change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.
But don't expect to find the new $10 note in your wallet just yet. In January 2006, the U.S. government will begin to circulate the new bills. The government plans to redesign the currency every seven to 10 years to stay ahead of counterfeiters.

343,667,"Can you imagine not having a chance to play tag or hopscotch in the schoolyard after lunch? For many students around the country, their afternoon break is quickly becoming history. Nearly 40 percent of elementary schools have either eliminated or are considering eliminating recess, according to the American Association for the Childs Right to Play.
Why? Some school officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They hope that more time in class will help students perform better on standardized tests.
In addition, many schools are cutting recess because they can no longer afford to offer it. Those schools dont have the money to hire lunch aides or to buy sports equipment for the playground.
Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
Education experts also stress that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends.
At recess, many students learn how to
or work together, with other students. Many studies also show that recess helps improve test scores.
The National PTA and Cartoon Network recently launched a program called Rescuing Recess. To kick off the campaign, children across the country are being asked to write letters to let their local and state school officials know that recess is important to them.
""We know many children enjoy recess as a welcome break from the classroom, and parents appreciate the balance that it offers between schoolwork and play,"" says Anna Weselak, National PTA president.
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess? Dont worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving.
Turn on music and dance in your room.
to express your views about break time and to let local school boards know that recess is important to you.

344,426,"Scientists make a splash with the discovery of new marine species.
Scientists in Indonesia think they have found hidden treasure52 new types of marine animals! The researchers believe that the 24 types of fish, 20 types of corals, and 8 types of shrimp are new to science.
The researchers spotted the new species off the coast of Papua, a province on one of the more than 13,500 islands that make up Indonesia. The area, Birds Head Seascape, is one of the worlds most diverse marine regions.
""These Papuan reefs are literally species factories,"" says Mark Erdmann of Conservation International, who led the expedition. Many of the species are believed to be
to the area, meaning they are not found anywhere else.
Birds Head Seascape is part of Asias ""Coral Triangle."" The Triangle covers about 70,000 square miles in the Indian Ocean. It is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and almost 600 kinds of reef-building corals.
But the marine marvels off Papuas coast may be in danger. The Indonesian government is considering a plan to increase commercial fishing in the east, near Papua, because Indonesias western seas are overfished.
Wildlife groups are against the plan. They say it is
or absolutely necessary, to protect Birds Head Seascape. ""Its extremely important because this area is the center of coral reef
,"" Sherry Flumerfelt of the Coral Reef Alliance told
refers to the variety of species in a particular environment. We need to ""make sure these species are protected,"" says Flumerfelt.
Here are a few of the standout species that scientists recently spied in Indonesia.
A bottom-dwelling epaulette shark uses its fins to ""walk"" across the ocean floor in search of shrimp, crabs, snails, and small fish.
When its time to attract a mate, a male flasher wrasse ditches its drab brown hue for some brighter colors.
There are three times more fish in the Birds Head Seascape than in the Hawaiian Islands, including this newly discovered one.
Only a fraction of all marine species have been found. Why might it be difficult to find new ocean creatures?

346,1,"If you want to see the biggest ball of twine, the largest doughnut, the largest model elephant, or just about any other wacky thing, you have to take a road trip.
America's roads are lined with some of the wackiest attractions you will ever see. The earliest roadside attractions opened at about the time people bought the first cars.
Today, more people than ever are hitting the road and traveling by car. Many of those people are parking their cars in front of bizarre roadside attractions.
If one of the attractions doesn't meet your expectations as the biggest, longest, tallest, or best something, just drive a little farther.
What are some of these wacky wonders? If you are ever in Cawker City, Kansas, drop by to see the world's largest ball of twine. The ball is made of 7 million feet of twine and weighs 17,320 pounds. And it's still growing.
If you're tired of riding in the car, you might want to stop in Holbrook, Arizona. There, you can sleep in a motel room shaped like a teepee.
After a restful night in a teepee, you could go to Margate, New Jersey. There, you'll find Lucy the Elephant. Lucy isn't just any old elephant. She's a six-story-high model of an elephant that was built in 1881.
So don't miss out on the wacky fun. Take a road trip with your family, and see what amazingly strange things you can find along the roadside.

Each Friday, 8-year-old Cody Lozano and his older sister, Cherokee, 9, carry heavy backpacks home from school. Their backpacks are not stuffed with books and supplies. Instead, they are loaded with nutritious food.
The two siblings are members of the BackPack club at Douglas Elementary School in Tyler, Texas. Before they head home on Fridays, students in the club are given backpacks stuffed with donated food for the weekend. The goal of the program is to help kids who face hunger. ""This BackPack club is great for Cherokee and Cody,"" their mother, Karen Lozano, told
""The kids dont have to go hungry.""
Cody and Cherokee are among the nearly 14 million children in the United States whose families dont have enough money to buy food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Free school meal programs help some of those kids during the week, but they still need to eat on the weekends.
Thats where the BackPack program lends a hand. ""We purchase the backpacks and the food, and volunteers [stuff] the backpacks and distribute them,"" says Robert Bush, the executive director of the East Texas Food Bank in Tyler. BackPack programs operate in 39 states to help thousands of hungry children.
Although the BackPack program is one way to help, people are looking for solutions to end
(Poverty is the state of being poor.) About 38 million Americans go hungry each year, and many of those are children. With Thanksgiving around the corner, many people will be thinking about what they can do to help.

350,745,"William Jefferson Clinton is the 42nd president of the United States. He has been the president since 1993. He will leave office when the next president takes the oath of office on January 20, 2001. Recently, Bill Clinton answered questions from
What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency?
I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college.
I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college.
What advice would you give the new president?
A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count.
Why should kids be proud to be Americans?
We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals.
What has been the best part of being president?
The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives.
After being president for eight years, what will you do now?
The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.
William Jefferson Blythe IV was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas.
In 1962, when Clinton was a senior in high school, he was chosen to go to Washington, D.C., to participate in Boys Nation, a special youth conference. There he met President Kennedy. After that, he said, he knew he wanted to make a difference in the lives of Americans by becoming a U.S. president.
Clinton went to Georgetown University, after which he studied at Oxford University in England. He then went to law school at Yale University.
In 1976, Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas. He later was elected governor of Arkansas.
In 1991, Clinton decided to run for president of the United States.

351,259,"Aochan, a rat snake, and Gohan, a dwarf hamster, are an unlikely pair of friends. The two share a cage at a zoo in Tokyo, Japan. Zookeepers placed the hamster, whose name is Japanese for ""meal,"" in the snakes cage as a tasty snack. Instead of chowing down on Gohan, the snake befriended the furry rodent. ""Ive never seen anything like it,"" says zookeeper Kazuya Yamamoto. ""Gohan sometimes even climbs onto Aochan to take a nap on his back.""

352,658,"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years.
The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.
While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives.

353,280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

354,798,"One night in March, Daniel Calderone, age 12, was doing his homework in his California home. Then the lights went out, and he knew he wouldn't finish his assignment.
Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

355,441,"Fourth graders in the United States can give themselves a pat on the back. A recent report card for the nation shows that they are better readers than fourth graders were just four years ago!

356,175,"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers.
The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire.
After the danger from the wildfire passed, firefighters used water to wash the slime away.

358,606,"The next time you go to a McDonald's restaurant, you might get a homework assignment with your fries. Although getting homework with a burger and fries might leave a bad taste in your mouth, it will be for a good cause library books.
Teachers from around the United States have been working at McDonald's restaurants for a day. The teachers are taking part in McDonald's McEducation program.
First, the teachers learn how to use the cash registers. Then they take orders from customers. McDonald's donates 20 percent of the sales made by the teachers to schools. The money is used to buy library books.
The McEducation program helps schools and gives students a chance to see their teachers outside of school. ""It's really funny because they are teachers, and they don't look like they belong here,"" said one student from New Haven, Connecticut, after seeing his teachers working in a McDonald's restaurant.

359,407,"Admiral Richard Byrd was one of the first people to explore Antarctica. Beginning in 1928, the U.S. explorer led several expeditions across the frozen continent. Sometime between 1939 and 1941, Byrd or one of his group buried a Hershey chocolate bar in the ice near the South Pole. The candy bar remained buried for 60 years.
Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily.

360,361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

In addition, a men's sport must be ""widely practiced in at least 75 countries,"" and a women's sport must be practiced ""in at least 40 countries and on three continents.""
The United States is sending more than 200 athletes to the Games in Sydney. Those athletes are competing against athletes from more than 190 nations.
Other Summer Olympic events include track and field, swimming, baseball, and sailing.

362,761,"Eleven-year-old Josh Cook from Ohio became hooked on pocket bike racing last year. Josh races his pocket bike, or mini motorcycle, on a private track. He also makes sure to wear protective gear and safety equipment, such as a helmet and heavy boots, whenever he rides.
Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble.
Police in cities from Los Angeles to Boston are concerned about the safety of kids riding the popular pocket bikes. At less than 2 feet tall, the mini motorcycles are low to the ground.
""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told
. ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a drivers viewpoint.""
The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets.
Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers
This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles dont inform buyers that they cant be ridden on public streets.
Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a drivers license.
Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.
Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track.""

363,253,"Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system.
, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across.
At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons.
""We think that most of [the tiny moons] are the shattered remnants of captured moons,"" explained astronomer Brett Gladman.
Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king.
Earth's moon has a rocky surface dotted with craters
Mimas looks like the Death Star from the movie Star Wars
Dione's surface is completely covered with ice and craters
Titan is Saturn's largest moon. A thick, murky atmosphere surrounds it.

366,577,"Scientists recently confirmed that large, mysterious bones found near a river in San Jose, California, weren't those of any ordinary animal. They belonged to a Columbian mammoth, an elephant-like creature that roamed the area's grasslands between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. Those ancient animals weighed 10 tons and stood 13 feet tall.
Columbian mammoths were found throughout the southern half of North America 2 million years ago. They lived during the mild weather between
. An ice age was a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth.
Similar to elephants today, Columbian mammoths are believed to have had short gray hair. They are thought to be related to woolly mammothslarge animals with shaggy coats that lived during the Ice Age. Scientists don't know why either mammoth vanished.
This find marks the most complete mammoth skeleton ever discovered in California. Scientists will study the bones to learn more about these creatures. ""This is important because it creates a record of the animals that wandered the area,"" scientist Mark Goodwin told
. ""They are an important part of California history.""

369,389,"Smack Down! Is Pro Wrestling Bad for Kids?
""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe.
Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before.
Pro wrestling may be popular, but critics question whether watching it is good for kids.
Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said.
Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said.
Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book,
Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said.
Jayson Bernstein, a pro wrestling spokesperson, said wrestling officials know which wrestling matches kids watch, ""so we can [make] our programming fit those audiences.""
Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them.""
On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed.
Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school.

Toucans and other creatures hold on as their rain forest home dissappers.
fly among the forest. Emerald tree boas curl up on branches to stalk prey. Endangered jaguars slink through the thick brush in search of food. These are just a few of the thousands of animals that call the Amazon rain forest home.
A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

371,276,"Scientists have given new meaning to the words ""jet speed."" In early March, a NASA jet set a new record for speed.
The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.
Before taking off on its own, the jet launched from the wing of a plane in midair.
A rocket, which was later released, helped boost the jet's speed.
""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years.""
NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode.
In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at
speed, or faster than the speed of sound. NASA hopes its record-breaking feat will lead to a new era of supersonic flight for military, business, and space ventures.

The small, bear-like animal likes to dine mainly on bamboo but also munches on fruits, acorns, and insects. Red pandas are excellent climbers and spend most of their time in trees. They are mainly found in Nepal and southern China. Habitat loss and illegal hunting have endangered red pandas in the wild.

373,615,"About 66 years ago, Walt Disney was working on a new movie,
. To make the movie, he had to name all seven dwarfs. The Disney Company now says Sleepy, Dopey, and Bashful almost had different names.
Today, the names of the seven tiny miners seem perfect, but Disney had a hard time coming up with them. He thought of 50 names before he settled on the seven we know.
Some of the names Disney came up with included Scrappy, Crabby, Biggy-Wiggy, Dumpy, Gaspy, Tearful, Snappy, Helpful, Busy, Dirty, Awful, Dizzy, Shifty, and Gloomy.
It's hard to imagine Snow White or the dwarfs whistling while they worked with Dirty or Dumpy. Can you picture a dwarf named Awful or Crabby being much fun? In the end, neither could Disney, and he came up with the names you know today.

374,801,"A group of fourth graders witnessed firsthand proof that one person's junk is another person's treasure.
joined the students on their recent visit to the Garbage Museum in Stratford, Connecticut, where a giant, multicolored dinosaur molded out of garbage towered above them.
was sculpted out of a ton of trash! That is equal to 2,000 pounds of garbagethe amount of trash each person, on average, throws away each year. Philadelphia artist Leo Sewell scoured city dumps and created
out of old junk, from false teeth and license plates to toys, tires, and tennis rackets.
""I think the dinosaur is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,"" said fourth grader Jahkwe Aquart from Park City Magnet School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His classmate Julie Pham, 9, agreed. ""Instead of throwing away our garbage, we can reuse it.""
was made out of a ton of trash, including false teeth, license plates, and tires.
That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari.
Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away.
So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in
. In a landfill, garbage gets buried between layers of soil. Because many states are running out of room for landfills, more and more garbage goes to
(or resource-recovery) plants. At these plants, garbage is burned and converted into electricity that people use to power their lights, TVs, and video games.
Plastic bottles can be recycled at centers like this one.
Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to
, or make less, trashby throwing away fewer napkins when you eat, for instance. Another way is to
, or find new uses for, old items. Paper bags, for example, can be reused to make book covers or wrap gifts.
People also help decrease their solid wastes when they
. Recycling refers to putting old objects, such as glass, plastic bottles, newspapers, and aluminum cans through a special process so they can be used again. (See ""
Recycling has many benefits. Did you know that recycled plastic soft-drink bottles can be made into park benches, carpeting, and backpacks? The more people recycle, the less garbage ends up in landfills or waste-to-energy plants.
, or materials from Earth. To make an aluminum can from scratch, for example, the metal needs to be mined from the ground. That process harms the land and pollutes the air and water. Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years!
What are some other ways you can protect natural resources?
As part of their visit, the fourth graders got a look at the museum's recycling center. Here, they discovered that one
, or bundle, of recycled newspapers can save 17 trees! The message seems to have stuck with 9-year-old Arron Smith. ""When you recycle, you save trees and animals' homes.""
Did you ever wonder what happens to the aluminum cans you recycle?
watched a recycling center in action at the Garbage Museum.
Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated.
Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales.
The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop.""
Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:
Carry a lunch box instead of a paper lunch bag, and pack food in reusable containers.
Use both sides of a sheet of paper.
Donate old clothing and toys to a charity.
pile using food scraps, leaves, and grass clippings. Composting is nature's way of recycling. Plants and other wastes
, or rot, and nourish the soil.

375,49,"This greeting wishes others good fortune and happiness in the Chinese New Year. People kick off the holiday on February 18 this year.
The Chinese calendar is split up into months based on the
or moon, cycle. The Chinese New Year begins on the first new moon falling between January 21 and February 20. It ends on the full moon 15 days later, when the moon is brightest.
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday with music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. At celebrations, people wear red clothes and give children red envelopes with money for good luck. Red is considered a color that wards off bad luck.
The Chinese New Year ends with the Lantern Festival. On that night, children carry lanterns in a parade under the light of the full moon. The highlight of the Lantern Festival parade is the traditional dragon dance, when dancers guide a long, colorful dragon made of silk, paper, and bamboo through the streets.
Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. Legend has it that people born in each animal's year inherit some of that animal's qualities. This year is the Year of the Pig. People born in pig years are considered honest, kind, and well informed.

376,779,"Is Atlantis a myth? For centuries, people have wondered whether this legendary land really existed. A
is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning.
Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor.
The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time.
Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects.
Sarmast believes that he has found Atlantis in the Mediterranean Sea, between Syria and Cyprus.
Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof.""
A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination.
, or unsure, that the remains are those of Atlantis. Sarmast and his team are not the first researchers to believe that they have discovered the
, or sunken, land. Some of those explorers have placed it off Spain's coast, near Cuba, southwest of England, and in the South China Sea.
Plato wrote about Atlantis as an island in the western sea. Many people believe that location meant the Atlantic Ocean.
, or idea, is that the story of Atlantis refers to the ancient Minoan (mih-NOH-ehn) people. They lived on the islands of Crete and Thira, between Greece and Turkey.
Do you think Atlantis was real or a myth?
That civilization disappeared following volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Plato might have based his writings on that event. Even today, the mystery of Atlantis grows stronger and continues to

377,314,"Lighten Up! Most students carry too much weight in their backpacks.
A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

378,548,"Brazil protects part of the Amazon rain forest.
Jaguars and anteaters in northern South America can rest easy. A section of the Amazon rain forest as big as Illinois was recently placed under government protection. The land in Brazil links to protected areas in other South American countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.
In total, these protected forests cover nearly 58,000 square miles. The land also contains more than 25 percent of the world's
A tropical rain forest is a dense forest in a warm region that gets at least 100 inches of rainfall a year.
Environmentalists from the group Conservation International say this area of the northern Amazon has more
than all tropical forests on the planet. Biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals in an environment. The Amazon is home to more
or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world.
Since 1970, more than 232,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest have been destroyed. That is nearly the size of Texas! The destruction has endangered many animal species. Experts predict that the continued
or clearing of trees, at this rate would endanger the entire region by 2050.
Officials were especially concerned about preserving the forests. Part of the area is believed to contain more than half of all bird, animal, and plant species found in the Amazon. Many endangered animals, including the giant Amazon otter, make their homes there. Under the government's plan, those parts of the Amazon will be off-limits to the public.
""If any tropical rain forest on Earth remains intact a century from now, it will be this portion of [the northern Amazon],"" says Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International.
The Amazon rain forest is the world's largest tropical rain forest. It covers about 2 million square milesroughly two-thirds the size of the United States. The map shows the location of the Amazon rain forest and its newly protected areas.

379,604,"No, this isn't a scene from the movies. A submarine designer is planning to build a new hotel in the Bahamas in which half the rooms will be underwater. The Poseidon Undersea Resort is expected to open late next year. In the hotel's most expensive rooms, guests will be able to watch ocean life outside their windows. Visitors won't need to dive to their accommodations. They can reach their rooms from a tunnel on the beach.

An expedition to the Arctic has uncovered a giant sea reptile.
Scientists have discovered the skeleton of a sea monster near the North Pole. Researchers from Oslo, Norway, recently announced that they have found a complete
skeleton. A plesiosaur is a prehistoric marine reptile about the size of a bus. The recent discovery is believed to be the first complete plesiosaur skeleton ever found.
during an expedition to the Svalbard islands, 300 miles off the coast of Norway, in August. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals from millions of years ago preserved in rock.
The meat-eating reptile lived more than 150 million years ago, during the Jurassic Period. Some scientists call it the
of the sea. ""We think it is [a 26-foot] skeleton from snout to tail,"" team leader Jorn Hurum told
He described the plesiosaurs long teeth as being ""the size of bananas.""
The expedition also uncovered fossils from 27 other marine reptiles on the islands. ""We hope to find lots more in the years to come,"" says Hurum. ""We have just scratched the surface.""

381,644,"Kid Radio Show Arrives in School Buses
Is your bus drivers taste in music driving you crazy? If so, you may be in luck. Theres a new radio show just for kids. Called Bus Radio, it started playing in school buses in October.
or play on the air, on 800 school buses in 11 states. The show plays the latest The show plays the latest songs by Kelly Clarkson, Jesse McCartney, Bo Bice, and other artists. It also has contests and safety tips.
Bus Radio officials say the best part about the show is what it
play. Bus Radio doesnt air songs with swear words or violent lyrics. It also doesnt play commercials meant for adults, which might be bad for kids.
However, Bus Radio isnt music to everyones ears. After all, in addition to music and contests, the show also plays eight minutes of advertising every hour.
Most radio stations have ads. Bus Radio advertisers know that kids are listening. So they air ads for toys and other products that will grab kids attention. Even if kids dont want to listen, they dont have a choice. They cant get off the bus until they reach their stop.
Thats why school officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, decided not to play Bus Radio. ""We are in the business of educating children, not selling them Barbie dolls and computer games for profit,"" Linda Farbry, the districts director of transportation, told
4 billion miles those buses travel in a year
417 average number of trips each bus makes in a year

382,559,"I [want] to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code
Governor Bush says that roughly one-quarter of the government budget
(extra money), which comes from taxes, should be returned to the people. He says his plan would promote economic growth and help people lead better lives by cutting high tax rates. The plan would lower the tax rate for married couples and families with children. He says the 6 million poorest families would pay no taxes.
I am calling for the right kind of tax relief--tax cuts that [will] help those who need them the most
Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes, but not by the amount Bush wants to. He says some of the surplus money is needed to support Social Security, a program that helps older people. Gore also wants to pay the debt the United States owes. He wants to cut taxes for married couples and make it easier for people of all ages to set aside money for education.

383,294,"A sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
Wildlife officials in Florida have set up speed traps. The new speed traps, however, are not along highways. They are in the state's waterways.
The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters.
Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats.
State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club.

384,208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

385,95,"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters.
Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said.
An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke.
Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment.
Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out.""
Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!

388,325,"A reward is being offered for toy ducks washing ashore.
Some people may find more than shells along the northeast coast of the United States. Rubber ducks could wash ashore any time soon.
About ten years ago, 29,000 yellow rubber ducks that were headed for bathtubs around the country became lost at sea. Boxes of the toys fell off a ship during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. Plastic beavers, turtles, and frogs were included in the shipment too.
has been tracking the toys' journey. An oceanographer is a scientist who studies the ocean.
The plastic toys floated along Alaska's coast and through the Bering Strait. Bobbing past polar bears and seals, the toys were caught in ice around the North Pole for several years.
They eventually made their way into the North Atlantic Ocean. Some washed up in Iceland. According to oceanographers, the ducks are now due to waddle ashore in New England and Canada.
The ducks' voyage is teaching oceanographers some lessons about currents, including how trash and ocean pollution travel. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said the oceanographer tracking the ducks. ""It just goes somewhere else.""
To help with the research, The First Years, the company that owns the plastic toys, is offering a $100 savings bond for any duck that is returned by the end of the year. The ducks' color has faded, but there is a way to identify the plastic creatures. They are stamped with the words
Not just any duck will do. It has to be from the First Years flock! Believe it or not, many toy ducks are floating around the ocean. They are often left over from duck-race fundraisers. To learn more about the ducks, visit

389,291,"Crews restart construction on the space station.
Mission completed! On September 21, astronauts returned to Earth aboard the space shuttle
The six-person crew had come back from a successful journey to the
about 220 miles above Earth. The astronauts added new solar panels to the giant space lab. The solar panels will power the station, which
or travels around, Earth. It was the first major delivery to the space station since 2002.
Once completed, the space station will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. It will measure 361 feet end to end.
The space station is being built as a joint effort by 16 countries, including the United States. Construction began in 1998, and the first crew arrived in 2000. The diagram shows when parts of the space station were added.

390,6,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis is riding the wristband wave. Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she told
since she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. That is a substance that the body needs to help convert
, a sugar in food, into energy.
With the help of her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, Sydney ordered blue wristbands with the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today.""
The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City.

391,23,"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network.
Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week.
April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun.""
The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives.
Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week.
2. Many kids like to watch TV.
3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy.
So think about what you might do if you zapped off your television set for an entire week. Would you read a book? Head outside to ride your bike? Play a board game with your mom or dad?
""The limit is your own imagination and creativity,"" said Vespe.

392,151,"or the NBA playoffs? The TV-Turnoff Network wants you to do just thatand imagine what you can do instead of watching TV.
As a result, the theme of TV-Turnoff Week is ""Imagine."" The celebration takes place from April 24 to April 30. During the weeklong event, TV-Turnoff officials hope to raise awareness about the harmful effects of too much television.
Each American watches, on average, more than four hours of television per day, according to RealVision and the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!
Experts say that too much time in front of the TV can have a negative effect on children. Kids dont do as well in school and dont get enough exercise to stay in shape.
Robert Kesten, executive director of the TV-Turnoff Network, hopes that kids will turn off the television and get involved with other interests. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Kesten told
""We think kids will be surprised with the new discoveries they will make if they choose to shut off the TV for a week.""

The latest Elmo doll was created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, which caused a craze when it was introduced in 1996. When tickled, T.M.X. Elmo makes a few ""extreme"" moves, such as falling to the floor while laughing hysterically.

394,404,"It was a clear evening on July 23 as James Mennig stood outside his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As he looked up into the sky, Mennig saw something that caused him to turn and run inside.
Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said.
The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere.
A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars.
According to officials at the U.S. Department of Defense, the bright meteor, which is called a fireball, entered Earth's atmosphere above Scranton, Pa. People from Canada to Virginia saw the bright fireball.
Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield.
According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth.
Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise.
""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa.
*Meteors come from pieces of space debris called meteoroids. Meteoroids can be made of rock, metal, or both.
*A meteor is a piece of rock or metal that breaks away from a meteoroid and enters Earth's atmosphere.
*A meteorite is a meteor that falls through Earth's atmosphere and hits the planet.

395,128,"More than 1,000 years ago, the Maya lived in part of what is now Central America and southern Mexico. They built huge pyramids and large temples. They studied astronomy and developed a calendar. Then for unknown reasons, the Maya disappeared.
Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase.
Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called
, which are a kind of picture writing.
Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war.
During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area.
Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost.
At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal.
""This was not part of a struggle between two brothers, but part of a world war,"" said historian Arthur A. Demarest.
After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said.
The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities.
The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A long war caused the Maya civilization to decline.
Winds from a hurricane uncovered an ancient staircase.

2 charts like the one below (one for you and the other for a friend)
To play, players take turns rolling the die for seven rounds, filling in their charts after each turn. To fill in your chart, write the number rolled in either the tens or the ones column. Put a zero in the other column. Keep track of your running total. For example, if you roll a 6, you can write either:

397,41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
The settlers at Jamestown were often hungry.
Historians are studying artifacts from a well to learn about Jamestown.

399,118,"Nine-year-old Hannah Niles loves poetry! The fourth grader especially enjoys reading poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. ""He uses a lot of expression and detail in his poems,"" she told
Hannah belongs to the Basketball Poets. That is a group of 40 fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in Supply, North Carolina. The students meet once a week in the gym, where they read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball.
Poetry lets kids express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said 10-year-old Douglas Mitchell.
The Basketball Poets also had the opportunity to meet two published poetsKenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's authors visited the school and gave the students advice on writing poetry. ""They were professional, and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said Hannah.
Who came up with the idea for the Basketball Poets? It was the school's physical education teacher, Marty Mentzer. She sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""It's cool to be a reader and a writer,"" she said, ""and basketball teaches them teamwork.""

400,614,"Election Day is only a couple of weeks away, and the presidential candidates are very busy. They are traveling around the United States asking people to vote for them in the presidential election.
George W. Bush agreed to answer questions about himself in writing. Here's what he had to tell the kids of the United States.
: Tell us about someone who is a hero to you and why that person is a hero.
: My parents [are my heroes] because they gave me unconditional love when I was growing up. They were great role models for raising my own daughters.
: What was your favorite subject in school and why?
: American and European history [were my favorites]. I believe that understanding the past helps us better understand and deal with situations happening in today's world.
: What do you think is the biggest change between being a kid when you were growing up and being a kid now?
: I think life was simpler when I was a kid growing up in a small west Texas town called Midland. We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it.
: Your father, George Bush, was president. What is it like to have a former president as a dad?
: My father is a wonderful role model and a loving dad, and his example has inspired me in many ways. My father taught me to appreciate and learn from history. By studying the careers of talented Americans who entered government, I learned that dedicated public servants can help people.
: Why do you want to be president?
: I want to be president because I want America to be a place where every child is loved and educated and where every one of our citizens is able to achieve his or her greatest potential.

401,600,"Thanksgiving Day is right around the corner. But before you dig in to enjoy that special family meal, health experts remind you to eat safely. Eating food too quickly is a major cause of choking.
A person who is choking can't speak or breathe. The
is a special move that can help save the life of someone who is choking.
hears from kids who help save lives after learning about the Heimlich maneuver in their student issues. Fourth grader Eric Wilson from Nevada was one of those kids. He put what he had learned to good useand saved the day. Earlier this year, he performed the Heimlich maneuver on first grader Bryce Bloomfield, who was choking on a piece of candy.
""His face started to turn red,"" Eric told
. Eric had to perform the Heimlich maneuver a few times before he saw the candy come out of Bryce's mouth. Eric says, ""I felt glad because I saved another kid's life.""
1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arm around his or her waist.
2. Make a fist and hold it against the person's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.
3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking.

402,54,"In the summer of 2004, Olivia Till, a student at Courtland Elementary School in Virginia, cut off a foot of her light brown hair. She donated her ponytail to Locks of Love. The Florida-based organization provides wigs to children who have lost their hair because of illness. Some children have lost their hair from cancer treatments.
Olivia, then a fourth grader, felt proud of herself for making the donation, but she wanted to do more. So she asked her principal, Sherri Steele, if she could organize a schoolwide cut-a-thon for the program.
Her principal liked the idea so much that she decided to donate her own hair as well. ""I've never had short hair in my life, so this was a personal challenge for me,"" Steele told
This past spring, a group of 29 students and teachers cut off their hair for donation to Locks of Love. Now a fifth grader, Olivia is planning to hold a second cut-athon in her school in December. She hopes her hair is long enough for another donation. What's her advice to others? ""Start something in your school or your community,"" Olivia told

, someone who designs and builds buildings, bridges, and other structures. But recently Simon traded in his old job for a new one--as a dinosaur hunter.
Simon, who says he loves dinosaurs, started a new business called Dinosaur Safaris. He takes people on dinosaur digs in Wyoming. Simon hopes that he can earn money with his company. ""If I could make a living doing this,"" he said, ""that'd be awesome.""
Simon is not the only fossil hunter who has given up another job in the hope of making a living finding fossils. Other people have started businesses in which they look for fossils. All of them hope to make a big find, which might mean big bucks. A

404,266,"Are Kids' Movies and TV Shows Too Violent?
have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content.
The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks.
One in five TV shows for kids has no educational content, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed.
Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was
. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said.
Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode.
Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota.
Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing.
You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life.
You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites.

405,205,"You've probably sat at a desk or on a bench on which someone had carved or scratched a message. Etching, or carving, messages is nothing new, however. People have been carving and painting messages on rock walls for thousands of years.
Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old.
The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling.
Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said.

406,806,"Earth Day encourages kids around the world to take action. From cleaning up local parks to testing local water, kids will be helping the Earth.
Eleven-year-old Michaela Piersanti from New Haven, Connecticut, thinks the environment needs to be protected all year long. ""We need to keep the Earth clean,"" she said. ""If we pollute, it can make animals sick and possibly kill them.""
occurs when harmful substances are released into the air, water, or land. Water gets polluted from sewage, factories, and chemicals. Pollution harms the plants and animals that live in the water. It also makes drinking water unsafe.
The theme of this year's Earth Day is ""Water for Life."" More than 1 billion people around the world do not have clean drinking water. Many children and their families will test the quality of their local water resources on Earth Day.
found underground. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
The burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air and water. Many scientists think that contributes to the overheating of the Earth.
The Earth Day Network wants people to rely more on clean sources of energy that don't pollute the environment. Some of those sources include sun, wind, and hydrogen power. For example, scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered cars that do not release harmful exhausts into the air the way today's gasoline-powered cars do.

407,501,"Just in time for Black History Month, President George Bush has signed a law to build a national museum honoring African Americans.
The National Museum of African American History and Culture will be part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It will include exhibits on slavery and other important periods in black history.
Getting approval for the museum was no easy task.In fact, politicians and leaders worked for almost 100 years to get the bill signed. ""This has been a long, hard effort, but we're here today,"" one government official told
. Planners estimate that building the museum will take about ten years.

408,691,"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans.
Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat.
In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement.
Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer.
Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer.
Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls.
When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that.
Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists.
By choosing pop tunes instead of the standard ringing sound, cell phone users can program their phones to match their personalities and moods, explained a company spokesperson.

410,568,"Ten-year-old Hunter York might have a fear of snakes, but that didn't stop him from picking up the two-headed creature that he found in his father's backyard.
The Kentucky boy used a stick to pick up the two-headed black king snake.
The snake ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" he said.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile.
, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad left the reptile with a snake expert because they couldn't get it to eat.
""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.

411,367,"The number of collisions between powerboats and manatees has been on the rise since 1976, according to the Save the Manatee Club. In that time, close to 1,000 manatees have died from collisions with powerboats. Thousands of others have been injured. In 2000, collisions caused 38 percent of manatee deaths in Florida.
To curb those collisions, Florida has already passed laws that limit a boat's speed to under 10 miles per hour in areas where manatees are found. Now, police are beefing up patrols and cracking down on waterway speeders.

412,421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

413,86,"Plans for an African-American history museum in Washington, D.C., have been in the works for more than a year. Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET).
The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money.
President George W. Bush authorizes the creation of a Smithsonian museum dedicated to African-American history and culture.
The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present.
""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members. The museum is expected to open in 2013.

414,160,"When you are at school or hanging with friends, do you wonder what your dog is doing in your house? If so, a new robot might be just what you need.
The robot, called Maron-1, is made by a company in Japan. Maron-1 looks like a cartoon copy of R2-D2. It weighs about 11 pounds and stands about 2 feet high. When it goes on sale in Japan next year, the robot will cost about $1,600.
The makers of Maron-1 say their robot is better than the other kinds of robots that you can buy at toy stores. ""Our robot is different from pet robots. It's useful,"" said a representative from the company that makes Maron-1.
Maron-1 can detect whether someone or something is moving in front of it. If it sees"" something moving, it says, ""An intruder found."" It can also call you on a cell phone to tell you about the intruder.

415,573,"Wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster.
The wildfires that recently swept through southern California have been called one of the Golden State's worst natural disasters. The raging wildfires destroyed homes, businesses, and forests. Nearly 750,000 acres burned-an area of land about the size of Rhode Island. ""The whole sky seemed as if it was on fire,"" said one California resident.
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames.
About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly
, or leave, their homes to escape the fire's destructive path. Many families lost their homes and belongings in the fires. At least 22 people died as a result of the fires.
President Bush declared several southern California counties disaster areas. Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger will work with officials to help homeowners and businesses rebuild.
Government officials say the wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster. They estimate rebuilding efforts will cost more than $2 billion.

A company has invented a perfume for cats that their owners can also wear. The perfume is called Oh My Cat. ""It is to promote harmony between you and your pet,"" said Nick Munafo, who works for the company that makes the perfume.
""On weekends, I put it on my cats, and they really seem to like it,"" he said. He added that he also wears a little of the perfume.

418,778,"A new tennis star has arrived. Andy Roddick claimed his championship trophy in early September. He won his first major tennis tournament at the U.S. Open in New York, defeating Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero.
""It hasn't sunk in,"" said an emotional Roddick after the match. ""I came to this tournament so many times as a little kid and watched from way up there [in the stands].
Along with his trophy, Roddick accepted a $1 million winning prize. Because of this championship win, Roddick has risen to number two in the tennis rankings, which is a career record for him. However, Ferrero, who won the French Open, still holds the top slot.
The four Grand Slam tournament in tennis are the Australian Open, Wimbledon the French Open, and the U.S. Open.
With Roddick's win, the torch has been passed to a new American tennis generation. Just days before Roddick's victory, American tennis star Pete Sampras announced his retirement from the sport. Sampras won the U.S. Open in 2002. He was just few years younger than the 21-year-old Roddick when he took home his first U.S. Open title in 1990.

419,759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

424,285,"Tone and style is about how you relate to other people, and this is vital if you want to make a good impression. For example, get it wrong and it seems as if you're talking down to others, or making fun of them, or even being rude and aggressive. So how do you get it right?
You've got tone and style. Work it!

425,80,"> Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as

as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.
Under pressure? See what happens when you cool down.

The current is the same everywhere in a

All three ammeters give the same reading in this series circuit
The current in a series circuit depends upon the number of cells. The more cells you add, the greater the current.
The more cells, the greater the current
You might think that the current gets less as it flows through one component after another. But it is not like this. The current is not used up by the components in a circuit. This means that the current is the same everywhere in a series circuit, even if it has lots of lamps or other components.

At the beginning of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, guards patrolling the castle wall at night are waiting for a ghost to reappear - they're afraid. They think it's the ghost of Hamlet's father who's just died. They call Hamlet's friend Horatio to come and see if the ghost will appear again.
What techniques could you use to create the right atmosphere for this scene? Think about:
You need to create an atmosphere that is spooky and frightening.
Here are some techniques you could use to create the atomsphere
The scene is set in a castle.
The scene is set at night, but the audience need to be able to see the guards.
Swords for the guards, dry ice for mist.
Dry ice will make it harder to see what's happening and create tension.
The audience need to recognise that these characters are guards.
No costume, you don't want the ghost to be seenjust a booming voice.
Sometimes things are more frightening when you can't see them! The booming voice will give the ghost power.

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14
3 weeks is 3  7 days = 21
4 weeks is 4  7 days = 28
So, the formula to work out the number of days is:
number of days = number of weeks  7

Character - First, second and third person accounts
A text can be written in the first, second or third person. This is all about who is telling the story. Here is a quick summary:
means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this.
means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.
Take a look at these three extracts. Decide which ""person"" each one is written in and check your answers to see if you are correct.

I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed (crossed) the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Original words
A sunny beach gives you all sorts of possibilities to use your senses. For instance:
The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach
. I looked down the beach towards the blue sea criss-crossed by the white triangles of sails
. The hot sun burned down onto my back and neck
, and the air was heavy with the smells of suntan oil, sea salt and ice cream
. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop
You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale.
Avoid clichs. These are phrases that are used so much that they have lost their power. For instance, if you are ""over the moon"" about something, or ""waiting until the cows come home"", then you are using clichs. Look for original phrases instead.
How could you improve the following sentences?
1) He was scared out of his skin.
2) The trees danced in the breeze.
3) She felt that her heart would break.
1) He felt his fingers uncontrollably tighten and clench together so that his nails dug deep into his palms.
2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling.
3) She knew that she wouldn't be able to speak or even look at him, and she kept blinking back the tears.
Hopefully, you'll find these second versions more accurate, creative and involving. So write down exactly what you see in your head when you imagine the scene. Don't take short cuts!

445,144,"Cutting the cake into six equal pieces and eating two is
to cutting the cake into three equal pieces and eating one. You eat the same amount of cake in both cases.
If the cake is cut into 12 equal pieces, how many will we have to eat in order to have the equivalent of 1/3 of the cake?
because the top and bottom numbers have been multiplied by 2.
because the top and bottom numbers have been divided by 4.
When writing equivalent fractions, do the same multiplication or division to the top and bottom numbers.
For example, if you multiply the top by 2, you must also multiply the bottom by 2.

446,429,"> Paragraphs - Why paragraphs are used
There are two main reasons why paragraphs are used:
To show a new speaker is talking.
Without paragraphs, texts would be very confusing.
Have a look at this extract from Louis Sachar's novel, 'Holes'.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign. ""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said. Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""

As you can see, the second version is far easier, and far clearer, to read.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The proposal
Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite.
The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too.
Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.

The Tempest first key extract - Language
When talking about the language, the things to concentrate on are:
The part that illusion has to play
The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

450,624," r  r. Only the 'r' is squared.
Find the area of the following (use
a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14  6  6 = 113.04cm
b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14  5  5 = 78.5cm
A dartboard has a radius of 20cm. The bullseye in the centre of the board has a radius of 1cm.
By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use
The area of the materials required is 10990mm
Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14  20  20 = 1256cm
The area of the small circle is 3.14  1  1 = 3.14cm
Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm
When calculating the area of a circle, remember to use the radius, not the diameter.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - The party
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course.
Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

453,365,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to advise
Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help.
For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help.
The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone.
You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this:
If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too.
It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice.

Food chains - Changes to food webs
Let's look at the food web again and ask some questions about its predator-prey relationships, with some possible answers.
What would happen if the grass died?
The grass is the producer, so if it died the consumers that feed on it - rabbits, insects and slugs - would have no food. They would starve and die unless they could move to another habitat. All the other animals in the food web would die too, because their food supplies would have died out. The populations of the consumers would fall as the population of the producer fell.
What would happen if the population of slugs decreased?
Slugs, rabbits and insects all eat grass. If there were fewer slugs there would be more grass for the rabbits and insects. With more food the populations of rabbits and insects would increase. However, the thrushes would have to eat more insects to maintain their population, so it is also possible that the population of insects could decrease. This is turn may reduce the populations of voles and frogs.
What would happen if the population of insects decreased?
There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks. However, there are likely to be more rabbits and thrushes for them to eat, so their populations are likely to stay the same.

In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

458,224,"A food chain shows the different organisms that live in a habitat, and what eats what.
A food chain always starts with a producer, which is an organism that makes food. This is usually a green plant, because plants can make their own food by photosynthesis.
A food chain ends with a consumer, which is an animal that eats a plant or another animal. Here is an example of a simple food chain:
Take care - the arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. If you get the arrows the wrong way round, instead of showing that humans eat cows, you are showing that cows eat humans, and that grass eats cows.
There are several words used to describe the organisms in a food chain. Study this food chain:
The plant is the producer and the animals are consumers.
Notice that the first consumer in the chain is also called the primary consumer, the next one is the secondary consumer and the one after that is the tertiary consumer.
A consumer that eats plants is called a
, and a consumer that eats other animals is called a
is an animal that eats both plants and animals.
A predator is an animal that eats other animals, and the prey is the animal that gets eaten by the predator. In the food chain above:
the frog is a predator and the grasshopper is its prey.
the hawk is a predator and the frog is its prey.

Acids, bases and metals - Bases and alkalis
Bases are substances that react with acids and neutralise them. They are usually metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates or metal hydrogen carbonates. Many bases are insoluble - they do not dissolve in water.

All alkalis are bases, but only soluble bases are alkalis
You will have used some strong bases and alkalis at school, such as

is also commonly used in cleaners. Ammonia can be recognised by its choking smell.
It is wise to wear gloves when using these substances, otherwise they will react with your skin and burn it.
Weak bases and alkalis are found in toothpaste, antacid tablets (to help cure an upset stomach) and baking powder.

Inform, explain and describe - The differences
, the writing tends to stick to facts - things you know about and things that can be checked elsewhere.
, the writing tends to be about facts and reasons, so you'd write about why or how something happened.
, it's like taking a photo of something - you need information, but also lots of interesting details. You can include your own thoughts and feelings as well, because that helps convey information to your audience.
So really, the ideas and topics you can write about are almost the same. It doesn't matter which of the three styles you are doing, you basically want to give information to your readers. What makes the difference is how you go about it.

472,127,"There are two main types of language: literal and figurative.
Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction.
Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.
Find out the difference between fact and fiction.

More on formulas - Changing the subject of a formula
Sometimes you need to rearrange the formula to find the value you're looking for.
The area of a circle (A) is
This is useful if we know the radius of the circle and want to know the area. But what if we want to find the radius?
We need a formula that has r = (some expression in A). We get this by rearranging the A =
[Then find the square root of both sides]
[Swap the sides to make it easier to read]
The formula has been rearranged. We say that now r is
Q1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle: C = 2
Rearrange the formula to make r the subject.
Q2. The formula to convert the temperature in F to the temperature in C is :
Rearrange this formula so that it will convert the temperature in C to the temperature in F (so that f is the subject). Write down your working, then check your answer.
r, so divide both sides by 2
9c = 5(f  32) [multiply by 9]
= f - 32 [divide by 5]

Measures of average - Mean from a frequency table
Sara wanted to know the ages (in whole years) of children on her school bus. She conducted a survey and her results are shown below:
To find the mean add all the ages together and divide by the total number of children.
If you type all those ages into a calculator it is highly likely that you would make a mistake or forget where you were up to.
It would be better if you could see these results displayed in a frequency table:
The frequency table shows us that there are six children aged 11, seven children aged 12, five children aged 13...etc.
To find the sum of their ages, calculate:
(6  11) + (7  12) + (5  13) + (7  14) + (3  15) + (2  16) = 390
The total number of children is 6 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 30
So the mean age is 390  30 =
You could also write this information into the table as shown below:
Mean = 390  30 = 13

476,31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

478,446,"The way sentences are used can be just as important as the language they contain. They can create a flowing, lyrical effect. They can build up tension and drama. They can put across anger or humour. They can make writing seem simple or complex.

479,395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

482,171,"> Explore, imagine and entertain - Short-stories
A short-story is easy to write if you:
Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more.
Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too!
Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer?
Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below.
Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this:
I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki?
The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - dont start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story.

483,182,"It is hard to answer this question just by looking at the fractions. However, if you write the fractions with the same bottom number, the question will be easy.
4 and 7 both divide into 28, so rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 28.
To compare fractions, first write them with the same number at the bottom.

Compounds and mixtures - The reactivity series
Magnesium burns very brightly when heated in air
Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame.
Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances.
Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame.
The reactivity series for some common metals
Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the
If you want to learn the reactivity series, you could try making up a mnemonic or silly sentence to help. Here's one - can you do better?

485,401,"> Listening - Showing you are listening
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it.
Good listeners show that they are listening by:
Making eye contact with the person that is talking to them
Using facial expressions to show that they understand or are reacting to what is said
Allowing the person who is speaking finish before they respond
Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand
Referring back to comments that have already been made
Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills?
In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background.
In a fight, right, who do you think would win -
(Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate.
There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold.
So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak?
No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week.
Because it would be four against one?
Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry.
We'd better be quiet. We're annoying her.
Choose the statement that is most true:
Emily is the best listener, because she says the least and she's just trying to get on with her work
Matt shows that he is listening because he asks questions to make sure that he understands what Abdul really means, and he is sensitive towards Emily's feelings.

488,544,"> Representing data - Constructing pie charts
To construct a pie chart you need to work out the fraction of the total that the sector represents. You can then convert this to an angle and draw the sector on the chart.
Constructing pie charts - using a table
The table below shows the grades achieved by 30 pupils in their end-of-year exam.
To show this information in a pie chart, take the following steps:
Work out the total number of pupils
: 7 + 11 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30
To work out the angle of each segment,
work out the fraction of the total that got each grade
There are 360 in a full turn, so to work out the angle,
The grade A sector has an angle of 84
Repeat this process to find the angle of the segments for the other grades
Once you have calculated the angles of the segments, construct the pie chart
Copy and complete the following table, then use the data to construct a pie chart.

492,174,"To divide a large number by a 1-digit number you can set it out like this:
7 goes into 9 once with 2 remaining (remainder 2), so put a 1 above the 9 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
7 goes into 26 three times, remainder 5, so put 3 over the 6 and carry 5 to the hundreds column.
7 goes into 54 seven times, remainder 5 so put 7 over the 4 and have a remainder of 5.
So 964  7 = 137 remainder 5
We write this with an 'r' for 'remainder', so it looks like this:
964  7 = 137 r 5

494,547,"Probability is often based on surveys, because you get a more accurate measure of probability by basing your calculation on a large number of results.
Alex is doing some reporting for his local paper. The subject of his article is 'holidays'.
As part of his report he decides to question 10 of his friends whether they prefer caravanning or camping holidays. Seven out of 10 say that they prefer caravanning, so Alex writes the dramatic headline you see above.
Alex has based his probability on a very small survey. This is equivalent to throwing a die 10 times, throwing a 6 nine times by chance, and stating that the probability of obtaining a 6 is
! To estimate probabilities from the results of surveys, you must gather a large number of results.

Collecting and recording data - Two-way tables
Aled carried out a survey to see how many of his classmates are left-handed. His results are shown in the table below:
This is an example of a two-way table and it is used to show two different features in a survey.
You can find out lots of information from this table. For example, you can see that there are 2 left-handed boys in the class. You can also see that there are 13 girls in the class (1 left-handed and 12 not left-handed)
Q1. How many right-handed children are there in the class?
Q2. How many children are there in total?
A1. There are 14 right-handed boys and 12 right-handed girls, so 14 + 12 =
This is the total of all the numbers in the table.

Food chains - Toxic materials in the food chain
Toxic materials are poisonous. Some quickly break down into harmless substances in the environment. Others are
and do not break down. Instead, they accumulate in the food chain and damage the organisms in it, especially the top predators.
Mercury compounds were used until quite recently to make
(chemicals that kill the insects that damage crops) and special
that stop barnacles growing on the hulls of ships.
Unfortunately, when it gets into the food chain mercury damages the
of mammals, including humans. The diagram shows how mercury can accumulate in the food chain.
Tiny plankton in the sea absorb the mercury compounds. When the plankton are eaten by small fish, the mercury they contain stays in the fish. As the fish need to eat a lot of plankton, the concentration of mercury in them becomes higher than its concentration in the plankton.
The small fish are eaten by larger fish, and these are eaten by still larger ones, such as tuna fish. This creates a high concentration of mercury in the tuna. People eating contaminated tuna may get mercury poisoning. Mercury is now banned from many chemical products and mercury use in industry is carefully regulated.
DDT is an insecticide that can pass up the food chain from insects to small birds, and then from the small birds to birds of prey, like hawks. It can accumulate in the birds of prey, giving them a large amount of DDT. Concentrations of DDT in birds causes weakness in their eggs, and reduces their population. DDT is now banned because of this.

502,441,"We can see why variety is important by looking at this list below. It is taken from a story called ""You are now entering the human heart"", by Janet Frame, and is actually one of her paragraphs broken down into simple sentences:
None of them had ever touched a live snake.
They were waiting for the drama to begin.
The attendant took a green snake out of a basket.
He draped the snake around the teacher's neck.
She did not have a chance to protest.
He stepped back to admire the sight.
It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book.
Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied.
So the key points to remember about sentences are:
You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write.
Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point.
Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do.
Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

503,344,"We need to get oxygen from the air into the blood, and we need to remove waste carbon dioxide from the blood into the air. Moving gases like this is called gas exchange. The alveoli are adapted to make gas exchange in lungs happen easily and efficiently.
Here are some features of the alveoli that allow this:
they give the lungs a really big surface area
they have moist, thin walls (just one cell thick)
they have a lot of tiny blood vessels called capillaries.
from where they have a high concentration to where they have a low concentration:
Oxygen diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood.
Carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the air in the alveoli.
In order to see this content you need to have both
is also lost from the surface of the alveoli into the lungs - we can see this condensing when we breathe out on cold days.

Take a look at the extract below from Tricia Holford's book, 'Fly Away Home'. The extract describes a pair of lions in two settings, their natural home in Africa and in captivity at a rooftop bar in Tenerife.

It was a dramatic contrast to my first encounter with them on a Tenerife rooftop in 1994. That image of two
lions pacing back and forth in their

. For five years Raffi and Anthea had mentally survived in these conditions  how? I never believed I would one day see them in their ancestral home.
Explain the differences between the two lions':
Try to use quotations to support your ideas.
Very stressed and unhappy. 'Pacing back and forth' and barely surviving.
Relaxed and peaceful. Lying in the shade and roaring to mark their territory.
In a 'tiny cage' with no water, a rubbish bin and 'narrow sleeping shelves'.
In an 'ancient African valley', their natural habitat.
Stressed and horrible. The lions are cruelly treated and are 'thin' and 'grubby'.

If an inequality isn't as straightforward as x > a, or y > b, you need to rearrange the inequality to be able to solve it.
First, you need to get the y values on their own, so minus 1 from each side to give:
To find y, divide both sides by 5 to give:

Energy transfer and storage - Saving energy
Electricity can be generated in many ways, including:
in power stations using fossil fuels or biomass fuel
Most of the UK's electricity is generated in power stations using
energy released from the burning fuel is used to boil water to make steam, which expands and turns turbines. These drive the generators to produce electricity.
the fuel is burned to boil water to make steam
the spinning turbine turns a generator which produces electricity
the electricity goes to the transformers to produce the correct voltage
when they burn, we are aiming to produce more of our electricity using other,
energy resources. This will reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up.
We can also reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up by saving energy. For example, we can:
walk to instead of getting using cars where possible
turn off the lights when leaving the room

Although we only need small amounts of the different vitamins in our diet, we become ill if we don't get enough. For example,
deficiency causes scurvy, which makes the gums bleed, and

Food is a store of chemical energy. If you look on the side of food packets you will see the food's energy content. This is usually measured in
. If we eat too little food, we will use up our store of fat and become too thin. If we eat too much food, especially foods rich in sugar and fat, we will increase our store of fat and become too fat.
It is important to balance the amount of food we eat with who we are and what we do. The amount of energy we need from our food depends on our age, our height and how much exercise we get.
For example, a one-year old baby needs 3850 kJ each day to continue to grow, whereas an adult Olympic swimmer in training needs 15,600 kJ each day. Someone who sits at a desk all day will need less food than their twin who climbs ladders all day to wash windows.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy transfer diagrams
Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of
. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below.
We can show the transfers like this:
the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the
energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms.
But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by
. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this:
Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

513,262,"When using trial and improvement guess what the answer might be, then improve on it until you get close to the correct answer.
A square has an area of 20 cm
. Use a method of trial and improvement to find the length of its side, correct to 1 decimal place (1 d.p.).
4 is too small, so try 5:
4 is too small, and 5 is too big, so the answer lies between 4 and 5.
between 4.4 and 4.5, but it is closer to 4.5
The question asked us to find the length of the side correct to 1 d.p., so you only need to try values with 1 d.p.
If, however, the question had asked for values correct to 2 d.p. you would have got a more accurate answer. For example:
Round up, round up and try this activity!

519,278,"Behaviour can be investigated in the field or in the laboratory.
It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.
Is it instinct or conditioning that makes you study science?

520,125,"Here's a brief outline of the different types of sentences (if you want more details, look at
A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example:
There can be several words in the verb, so
- has two words in the verb.
- has three words in the verb.
However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand.
A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example:
It was cold but we still went to town.
It was raining and we stayed indoors.
This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand.
A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence:
You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try.
We can take away the first part, but then we are left with:
Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense.
We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

523,129,"Certain texts, especially non-fiction, will be laid out in ways that
, to make information clear, or to help you find what you want to read. You will not be asked to write in detail about how a text is laid out until GCSE, but your teacher may ask you a short question on layout.
Scan over the following text and note down at least four things the writer has done to make it look more interesting and easy to read.
Red Mount Chapel is on a mound on ""The Walks"" in the park.
Red Mount Chapel is a superb example of the Gothic style in architecture and even boasts its own musical ghost!
Built in 1485 at the time of Henry VII, the first Tudor king, it was a stopping-off place for pilgrims on their way to Walsingham via the port of King's Lynn. Octagonal in shape, it is very small, and had three floors. The top floor is a chapel with fan tracery much like that in Cambridge's King's College.
Underneath the chapel building there is reputed to be a long tunnel (not unusual), running to Castle Rising - a distance of 18km/12 miles (very unusual). An unfortunate, drunken fiddler once decided to explore the dark passageway with his instrument, his dog and his pint! He never reached the end of the tunnel, wherever it went, but his spirit remains and can be heard on occasions playing his tunes and singing, accompanied by the whining of his poor dog!
writing of the heading and unusual font catches our attention.
writing is used for the subheadings, which list the location details.
These details are separated from the rest of the text so they are easy to follow.
The most interesting fact, about the haunting, is mentioned first, and kept in a short paragraph of its own.
An image of the haunted tunnel is used to draw the reader's attention.
subheading is used to draw attention to ""Places of Interest in the Neighbourhood"".
These places are listed, using bullet points to make them clear.

529,592,"> Constructing triangles and bearings - Bearings
Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60 and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place?
One way of describing direction from a point is to use
A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the
So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120 and start walking.
The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is 30. We say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of 030 from Heathrow Airport.
Click 'Play' to see the direction change in the diagram below. Click 'Pause' to see the bearing.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Bearings are always described using three figures. So for less than 100 put an appropriate number of 0s in front. Eg 020, 037, 002, 007.

531,101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =

the same as breathing (which is properly called ventilation).
The glucose and oxygen react together in the cells to produce carbon dioxide and water. The reaction is called
because oxygen from the air is needed for it to work.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration:
(Energy is released in the reaction. We show it in brackets in the equation because energy is not a substance.)
Now we will look at how glucose and oxygen get to the cells so that respiration can take place and how we get rid of the carbon dioxide.
, obtained through digestion of the food we eat. Digestion breaks food down into small molecules. These can be absorbed across the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream.
Glucose is carried round the body dissolved in blood plasma, the pale yellow liquid part of our blood. The dissolved glucose can diffuse into the cells of the body from the
. Once in the cell glucose can be used in respiration.
When we breathe in oxygen enters the small air sacs, called
, in the lungs. Oxygen diffuses from there into the bloodstream.
Oxygen is not carried in the plasma, but is carried by the red blood cells. These contain a red substance called
, which joins onto oxygen and carries it around the body in the blood, then lets it go when necessary. Like glucose, oxygen can diffuse into cells from the capillaries.
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body
Carbon dioxide from cells to the air
The carbon dioxide produced during respiration diffuses out of the cells and into the blood plasma. The blood carries it to the lungs. It then diffuses across the walls of the alveoli and into the air, ready to be exhaled.

537,595,"> The Tempest Summary - The shipwreck
Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship.
Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned.
Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant.

Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers.
As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"". It is clear, too, from the names he calls him, that Prospero has not forgiven Caliban for an attack he once made on his daughter.

538,210,"> Food chains - Pyramids of numbers
The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it
Fleas are very small and lots of them can feed on a rabbit

539,353,"The commonly used metric units of length include:
To find a suitable unit to measure something in, you should first estimate how big it is. So, for example, do you think it's better to measure the distance between London and Manchester in metres or kilometres? Or, should an insect be measured in metres or millimetres?
Imagine the length of the objects you are estimating or imagine measuring them in relation to other objects. For example:
Imagine a metre ruler next to a tall man. You would expect him to be taller than 1 ruler, but not as tall as 3 rulers.
Imagine a bag of sugar on some scales. You would expect the needle to move round a little, but not to whizz round to 50kg.
Imagine a 1-litre bottle of cola. You would expect it to hold approximately the same amount as a large flask.
Q1. Which unit of measurement (km, m, cm or mm) would you use for the following?
b) the length of a football pitch
d) the distance from London to Manchester

540,136,"> Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly.
Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them.
So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so
cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its

Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge.
The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360.
Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360.
In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.

543,51,"> Measures of average - Comparing distributions
Complete the following table. The data shows the scores in two tests, English and Maths, across a set of ten students.
In order to see this content you need to have both
If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why?
The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4).
The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case.
If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too).
If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students.
So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information,
a combination of the median and the range would be best.
So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.

Variation and classification - Inherited & environmental
Some variation within a species is inherited, and some variation is due to the environment.
Variation in a characteristic that is a result of genetic inheritance from the parents is called
Children usually look a little like their father, and a little like their mother, but they will not be identical to either of their parents. This is because they get half of their inherited features from each parent.
Each egg cell and each sperm cell contains half of the
needed for an individual. When these join at fertilisation a new cell is formed with all the genetic information needed for an individual.
Here are some examples of inherited variation in humans:
Gender is inherited variation too, because whether you are male or female is a result of the genes you inherited from your parents.
Characteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will will grow taller as it tries to reach more light.
Variation caused by the surroundings is called
. Here are some other examples of features that show environmental variation:
flower colour in hydrangeas - these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soil.
Some features vary because of a mixture of inherited causes and environmental causes. For example, identical twins inherit exactly the same features from their parents. But if you take a pair of twins, and twin 'A' is given more to eat than twin 'B', twin 'A' is likely to end up heavier.

> Changes in the environment - Humans
Humans are very successful living things. We compete with other organisms for many natural resources. These include:
The worlds population of humans is increasing all the time. In the year 1800 it was about
, and now it is more than
More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years.
Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use.
We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out.
The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result.
Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worlds forests are steadily shrinking.
The maps below show the loss of forest across the world over the last 10 thousand years.

1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter:
During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely.
Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely.
2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies:
As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them.
Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.

> Astronomy and space science - Introduction
The solar system contains planets, their satellites, asteroids and comets. The planets orbit the Sun and take different amounts of time to do this.
We have night and day on Earth because the Earth spins on its axis. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the seasons to change as we orbit the Sun in one Earth year.

552,403,"> Reproduction - Fertilisation and foetal development
During sexual intercourse the man's penis releases semen into the woman's vagina. Sperm cells travel in semen from the penis and into the top of the vagina. They enter the uterus through the cervix and travel to the egg tubes. If a sperm cell meets with an egg cell there, fertilisation can happen. Fertilisation happens when an egg cell meets with a sperm cell and joins with it.
The fertilised egg divides to form a ball of cells called an
. This attaches to the lining of the uterus and begins to develop into a
The foetus relies upon its mother as it develops. These are some of the things it needs:
It also needs its waste substances removing.
The foetus is protected by the uterus and the
, a liquid contained in a bag called the
is responsible for providing oxygen and nutrients, and removing waste substances. It grows into the wall of the uterus and is joined to the foetus by the
with the foetus's blood, but the placenta lets substances pass between the two blood supplies:
across the placenta from the mother to the foetus
waste substances, such as carbon dioxide, diffuse across the placenta from the foetus to the mother.
After nine months the baby is ready to be born. The cervix relaxes and muscles in the wall of the uterus contract, pushing the baby out of the mother's body.

Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties.
Solid (except mercury, which is a liquid)
About half are solids, about half are gases, and one (bromine) is a liquid
High (they feel heavy for their size)
Low (they feel light for their size)
Brittle (they break or shatter when hammered)
Poor (they are insulators, apart from graphite)
They make a ringing sound (they are sonorous)
Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others
For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

554,473,"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it.
The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class.
You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below.
Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?""
If you speak too quickly, you won't be clear. If you speak too slowly, your audience is likely to go to sleep. Vary your pace for effect and use dramatic pauses where appropriate.
If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions.
You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either.
Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make.
Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind!
Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand.
If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.
Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves:
Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content.
Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills!
Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them.
On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it.

556,497,"> Atmosphere and setting - Implicit meaning
- it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting.
Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race...
This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time.
In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold.
. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger.

559,185,"To multiply 237 by 4 without using a calculator, you can set it out like this:
Start with 4  7, which is 28, so write the 8 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
4  3 = 12, but remember to add the carried 2 to get 14. Write the 4 and carry the 1 to the hundreds column.
4  2 = 8, and we add the carried 1 to get 9.

561,1911,"Forum theatre is a technique you can use while acting out a scene. The group watching is encouraged to
. At other times, the actors themselves can stop the action, and ask for help. Sometimes someone else can step in and take over a role - or even introduce a new one.
Why use forum theatre? What can it add to a drama?
Sometimes it is hard, when devising drama, to imagine what a character might
at a particular moment. If you stop the drama when in role, and ask for help from your group, someone will probably give you a
of what to do or say next. They might also offer to take over the role to try out their idea - or even join the scene as another character altogether, to take things in a new direction.

For your exam, you will need to feel confident when dealing with fractions. This section will help you to recognise equivalent fractions and practise simple calculations.
It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.
To multiply fractions, you need to multiply the top numbers together, and multiply the bottom numbers together. Remember that you cannot cancel numbers that are both on the top of a fraction. Have a look at the example below.
OR cancel between the top and the bottom then multiply:
The 5s do not cancel because they are both on the top of the fraction.
Dividing a fraction by a whole number
of the original fraction, which would make the answer
The rule to remember when dividing fractions is that you
turn the fraction you are dividing by upside down, and multiply.
So going back to the previous example we can work this out by turning the

563,1066,"Fold mountains occur near convergent or compressional plate boundaries. Examples of fold mountains include the Alps, Rockies, Andes and Himalayas.
Where an area of sea separates two plates, sediments settle on the sea floor in depressions called geosynclines. These sediments gradually become compressed into sedimentary rock.
When the two plates move towards each other again, the layers of sedimentary rock on the sea floor become crumpled and folded.
Eventually the sedimentary rock appears above sea level as a range of fold mountains.
Where the rocks are folded upwards, they are called
. Where the rocks are folded downwards, they are called
. Severely folded and faulted rocks are called
High mountain ranges, eg Mont Blanc which is 4810m above sea level.
Contrasting microclimates on north facing (ubac) and south facing (adret) slopes.
Geologically young (30  40 million years old).

564,5167,"Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.

565,1375,"Martin Parr talks about why he loves using a camera and how he decides what to take and which photos to use.
Martin Parr was born in Surrey in 1952 and is an acclaimed documentary photographer and photo-journalist.
He studied at Manchester Polytechnic and since then has used photography and film to take a critical look at mass tourism, food and the family amongst other subjects.
Martin Parr still shoots in medium-format colour but has experimented with fill-in flash and a 35mm ringflash camera.
His work can be poignant and joyful at the same time and conveys his natural curiosity:
Photography is the simplest way of articulating how I feel about the world.
I don't crop my pictures. I just move in and out with my feet. So if I want to get closer I won't change lens I'll just get nearer to the subject.

566,2494,"We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on
we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence.
We might want to say Don John is an aggressive and angry character. We can then support this view by looking at his language. He says that if he had a mouth he ""would bite"", and that he only has his unhappiness to make use of.
Here we are using two ways to provide evidence: words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks, for example, ""I am a plain-dealing villain."" The second way is to describe what is said in your own words, for instance, Don John plans to stop Claudio's marriage to Hero. It is often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, Don John despises Claudio and calls him a ""start-up"" (an 'upstart' in modern English).
The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation. Many students write out whole chunks of the play. This is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it, and you will not get any marks for it.

You also need to be able to describe a feature's location on a map by giving a map reference. From a map you should be able to pick out key information on natural features and types of human activity (eg, is this an rural or urban location?)
Maps are representations of the world. Maps are written by people called
the world. Maps contain information tailored to a specific purpose.
, for example, contains information that helps the reader get from one place to another using a vehicle.
will contain information of less interest to a road user, such as how the land in a place is used, the population density and the political boundaries that exist between regions, states and nations.
There are five fundamental things you need to be familiar with to read a map successfully:
Compass directions are vital for finding your way around a map. There are many ways to remember where each direction goes. You probably learnt a rhyme or a phrase to help you remember - if not, here's one now. Starting at the top and moving clockwise the directions on a compass or map are:

maps are divided into numbered squares. These squares can be used to give a place a four or six-figure grid reference. It is important that you know both
Easting are lines that run up and down the map. They increase in number the further you move east (or right). You can use them to measure how far to travel east.
Northings are lines that run across the map horizontally. They increase in number the further you move north (or up the map). You can use them to measure how far to travel north.
numbers along the bottom of the map come first and the numbers up the side of the map come second

Just like a key to a door, the key on a map helps you to unlock the information stored in the colours and symbols on a map. You must understand how the key relates to the map before you can unlock the information it contains. The key will help you to identify types of boundaries, roads, buildings, agriculture, industry, places of interest and geographical features.

Make sure you read the title of a map before you start to use it. This will give you a general idea about the information it stores. While it may appear a straight-forward thing to do, under exam conditions, it is easy to confuse different maps or not use the one that is most useful.
The scale of a map allows a reader to calculate the size, height and dimensions of the features shown on the map, as well as distances between different points. The scale on a map is the ratio between real life sizes and how many times it has been shrunk to fit it on the map.
The scale below is for a 1:50,000 scale map. At this scale, 1 cm on the map represents 50,000 cm on the ground (= 500 metres or 0.5 kilometres).
maps, the most common type of map in the UK, come in several scales.
Travel maps have a scale of 1:125,000. This means 1cm on the map represents 125,000 in the real world or 1 cm = 1.25km. These are used by drivers going long distances.
Landranger maps are 1:50,000 (1cm = 500m). These are useful for drivers going shorter distances.
Explorer maps are 1:25,000 (1cm = 250m). These are useful for walking and other outdoor pursuits.
Landplan maps are 1:10,000 (1cm = 100m). These show individual streets clearly and might be used by town planners.
You will be asked to interpret maps to find out specific information. Being able to distinguish between different types of land use on an Ordnance Survey (OS) map will help you interpret maps during your exams. Here are some things you should brush up on:
Make sure you can tell the difference between urban and rural land use. Start by looking at the key. Are the features in the key related to the countryside or to towns?
Look out for features of the urban landscape that are represented in symbols on the OS map. Start by looking at modes of transport (eg junctions of main roads, railways, ports and airports).
Look for rural features. Study the key carefully to see what different areas of shading on the map represent. For example, different types of farmland will be shaded differently.
Study the relief of the land on your OS map by looking for the
lines on a map joining points of equal height above sea level - thus representing the slope of the land
. Contours will show you where the hills (elevations) and valleys (depressions) are on the map. Contours will often show changes in height of 5 or 10 meters. The closer the contours are together the steeper the slope is. If the contours are far apart, you might be looking at a flat flood plain. On the map below the contours in square
are quite close together - indicating a fairly steep
Make sure that you know how to interpret different types of map. Read keys and grid references carefully.
When drawing maps be sure to include the following:
- stating what the map shows (eg land use or vegetation cover)
- so the reader knows what the symbols on the map represent
- showing which way is up (North)
- so the reader can translate distances shown on the map into distances on the ground
: In the case of map skills the internet is
. The best way to practise map skills is to use real OS maps. If possible look at a number of different types of map - this will help you identify urban and rural landscapes, different human activities and human influences on the landscape.

are unstable. They break down and change into a completely different type of atom. This process is called
Over time, as the unstable atoms in a source of radiation change, the activity of the source goes down because there are fewer unstable atoms present to decay.
It is not possible to predict when an individual atom might decay, but you can measure how long it takes for half the atoms to decay. This is called the
There are two definitions of a half-life, but they mean essentially the same thing:
The time it takes for the number of atoms in a sample to halve.
The time it takes for the activity of a source of radiation to fall to half its starting level.
Different radioactive isotopes and types of radioactive material have different half-lives. For example, the half-life of
is nearly 6000 years, but the half-life of
It is possible to find out the half-life of a radioactive substance from a graph showing the count rate against time. The graph shows the
The decay curve for a radioactive substance
The count rate drops from 80 to 40 counts per minute in two days. So the half-life is two days. In the next two days, it drops from 40 to 20, ie it halves. In the two days after that, it drops from 20 to 10, ie it halves again, and so on.

570,3698,"etwork) capable phone line can provide connection speeds of up to 64Kbps (single channel) or 128Kbps (dual channel) using a terminal adapter often referred to as an ISDN
a piece of hardware that connects a computer to the Internet
. The terminal adaptor removes the need to convert
data measured at discrete intervals, eg a digital watch typically moves from displaying one second to the next without displaying the values in-between
signals to analogue signals before theyre sent down the telephone line, this results in a more reliable
a computer's or another internet-enabled device's connection to the Internet
ine) provides connection speeds of up to 24
and uses a telephone line to receive and transmit
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
The speed that data can be transferred is dependent on a number of factors:
Phone lines were designed to carry voice signals - not data. Signal quality can vary between lines and whilst it doesnt affect voice signals, it
The distance between your house and the
a system of electronic components that connects telephone calls and has been adapted and expanded to facilitate connections to the Internet too
has an effect on the speed at which data is transferred. A distance of 4Km is considered the limit for ADSL technology, beyond which it may not work.
a device for connecting computers and other network capable devices together to form a network
Internet access over ADSL. This is usually provided by your
Internet Service Provider - needed in order to access the Internet, they also provide services such as web space and email
Phone calls can still be made whilst connected.
Cable companies do not use traditional telephone lines to provide broadband Internet access. They have their own
, a combination of co-axial copper cable and
cable that carries data transmitted as light
With their purposefully built infrastructure cable companies are able to provide speeds of up to 50Mbps - considerably faster than the highest available ADSL speed (24Mbps).
modem/router is needed for broadband Internet access over cable. This is usually provided by your ISP.
The making and receiving of phone calls is not affected because the telephone line is not used.

Perhaps Clarke chose this structure because, in a way, it reflects what the poem suggests about memory - the main points are fixed but the details are looser.
Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey her ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is the scene of the near-tragedy, Cold Knap Lake, an artificial lake in a park in Glamorgan. It is haunting that the name of the lake includes the word Cold - it is a word we associate with fear and death, ideas that are explored in the poem.
The poem is written in the past

, dealing with events in Clarke's memory. Certain details, those that made a big impression on her, such as the appearance of the girl when she was pulled from the water
(line 3) are described in detail, while other aspects are left vague. What effect does this give? What does it suggest about memory?
Apart from the poet's family, the characters are

The first stanza initially makes us believe that the child is already dead,

The person given the most vivid description is of Clarke's mother, since this is the scene that Clarke remembers most clearly. She was the

Just when we have been led to believe we are reading a 'happy ever after' story of rescue, we are told the girl was taken home and
(line 14). We are not told specifically why she was beaten - perhaps her parents were angry with her for the trouble she had caused, or found that hitting her was a way of venting the anxiety they had when they realised she was missing. Either way, the beating troubled Clarke so much that she wonders whether it actually happened -
There are a number of overtones of a fairy story in the poem - a miraculous rescue, a heroine, a poor family. Clarke explores this idea even further in

4, where she wonders about memory and what affects it. She says, ""When you recapture a memory from early childhood, you're sometimes not sure if you were really there, if someone told you about it, or if you read it in a story. I'd read fairy stories and legends about people drowning in mysterious lakes. I'd seen a famous painting of a drowned girl floating in a brook ..""
""All lost things lie under closing water""

576,3778,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice, and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
, you need to think about the ideas and attitudes in the poem, and then decide how you would read it aloud.
in a bitter way, suggesting Robin is angry that Batman prevented him from growing up for so long
in a thoughtful way, suggesting that Robin is reflecting on his experiences with Batman
triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last.
Most readers will probably feel that the tone should be mainly triumphantly, showing Robin's delight that he is free of Batman at last, yet it could be read thoughtfully.
Robin is mocking the fact that the 'good' Batman had an affair with a married woman and exclaims about it in an over-exaggerated way, using a comically inappropriate phrase for sex.
Batman always had Robin close by him, like a shadow, but Robin also felt as insignificant as a shadow. Now that the shadow is gone, Batman seems almost unreal - only ghosts leave no shadows...

578,5734,"In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!

580,1862,"A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse.
A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing.
for trust in real life situations. In the exercise, the person falling trusts that they will be caught by those behind them. In the minefield of personal relationships, you rely upon family and friends to 'catch' you.
The second stanza is full of colour. The jacket is canary-yellow (line 5) and becomes blackened (line 7). The child see[s] red - Armitage chose a phrase that uses colour to depict anger - and Blue murder is threatened. Yellow, red and blue are the primary colours: perhaps Armitage used these to show how vivid and 'colourful' the child's memories of the row are - it is obviously still important to him many years later.
The mother is described as the very model of a model of a mother (line 8). Does this suggest that she is a typical mother figure (as if like a child's model toy, reproduced in a factory) or a more-than-perfect mother (model as an adjective can mean 'ideally perfect')? Either way, she makes the wrong assumption about how the jacket got dirty - in the child's eyes, as least.
It is midnight when the child escapes to the phone box - always a time when special things may happen! This call seems to have been a symbolic attempt to get in touch with his future adult self.
The father figure (line 17) is in silhouette: the child can see his shape, but not his whole body. Does this suggest that their relationship with him is not now as 'rounded' as a result of the row? It is not definite that he is the child's actual father - only a father figure. The fact that he is waiting outside shows that he is concerned for the welfare of the child, but also that he wants to set things straight (line 17) - perhaps implying that the argument is not over yet!
The final stanza is an extended metaphor. The embrace between the child and the family is likened to putting on the yellow jacket that caused the row in the first place. Parts of the body become parts of the jacket, to show us how warm and loving the hug is. The poet does not know exactly what the jacket looks like -
""these fingers make a zip / or buckle, you say which""
(line 20), but it does not matter as
(line 23). In other words, continuity is restored, the family is whole again.
We can 'hear' some of the family row. Stanza two has many short phrases, showing tension rising in the household. Armitage uses
that the child and the mother may actually have spoken.
(line 11) could be the order of a furious parent: we can imagine their finger pointing towards the door!

586,212,"The formula for the relationship between currents in a transistor is
Determine the value of the emitter current (Ie) flowing through a transistor if the base current = 0.015 amps and the collector current = 0.16 amps.
Ie = Ib + Ic = 0.015 + 0.16 = 0.175 amps
The formula for calculating a transistor's current
the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage
A transistor has a current of 0.2 amps and 0.09 amps flowing through the collector and the base respectively. Determine the value of the current gain. Note that gain has no units because it is a ratio.

is the shaking and vibration of the Earth's crust due to movement of the Earth's plates (plate tectonics). Earthquakes can happen along any type of plate boundary.
Earthquakes occur when tension is released from inside the crust. Plates do not always move smoothly alongside each other and sometimes get stuck. When this happens pressure builds up. When this pressure is eventually released, an earthquake tends to occur.
The point inside the crust where the pressure is released is called the focus. The point on the Earth's surface above the
Earthquake energy is released in seismic waves. These waves spread out from the focus. The waves are felt most strongly at the epicentre, becoming less strong as they travel further away. The most severe damage caused by an earthquake will happen close to the

589,5959,"Calculating the number of sides in a regular polygon, given the interior angle
We already know the following facts about polygons:
The interior and exterior angles add up to 180 (a straight line - eg, a + f = 180), and
The sum of the exterior angles is 360 (a + b + c + d + e = 360).
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 120. Calculate the number of sides.
The interior angles are 120, so the exterior angles are 180 - 120 = 60. The exterior angles add up to 360, so if we divide 360 by 60 we find there are 6 exterior angles. Therefore, there are
The interior angles of a regular polygon are each 150. Calculate the number of sides.
If not, remember that the exterior angles are each 30 (180 - 150).
360  30 = 12, so there are 12 exterior angles, and 12 sides.

592,6438,"Despite efforts to 'turn metric', it is obvious that there are still many imperial units in use today. For example do you know your height in
? It is therefore helpful to know how to convert between the two.
Converting from one metric unit to another
Perhaps the most common metric conversions are between mm, cm, m and km.
1 m = 100 cm = 1000 mm
1 km = 1000 m = 100 000 cm = 1 000 000 mm
, so 1 km = 1000 m
Once you are confident with conversions between mm, cm, m and km, converting units of mass and capacity is eaier.
1 km = 1000 m, so 1 kg = 1000 g
1 m = 100 cm, so 1 l (litre) = 100 cl (centilitres)
1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 g = 1000 mg (milligrams)
A packet of biscuits weighs 150 g. Find the weight of 12 packets of biscuits:
12  150 = 1800, so 12 packets of biscuits weigh 1800g.
Remember that 1 kg = 1000 g. To convert from g to kg, we divide by 1000.

593,7331,"One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906-1914. Many historians label this period the beginning of the
A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:
Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the
. This imposed severe punishments for neglecting or treating children cruelly. It was made illegal to sell cigarettes to children or send them out begging. Separate juvenile courts were set up, which sent children convicted of a crime to

was passed. Part 1 of the act gave people the right to
of 10s a week for 26 weeks in return for a payment of 4d a week. Part 2 of the Act gave people the right to unemployment pay (
) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.

Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The squat pen rests: snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God the old man could handle a spade.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Over his shoulder, going down and down
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.

In this poem Heaney sees his father, an old man, digging the flowerbeds. He remembers how his younger, stronger father used to dig in the potato fields when Heaney was a child - and how his grandfather, before that, was an expert turf digger. Heaney knows that he has no spade to follow men like them - he is a writer, not a farmer - so will dig with his pen. He will 'dig' into his past.

uses helps to convey his ideas. Here are some points to consider:
The title is blunt. It is only when we have read the poem carefully that we realise that all three generation are involved in digging: his grandfather dug turf, his father dug up potatoes, Heaney is digging up his memories and his past.
The verb formation which describes the time at which the action occurred, eg past, present or future.
as Heaney describes seeing his elderly father straining among the flowerbeds, then goes into the past tense when he remembers his father and grandfather at work. The last two stanzas return to the present, when Heaney realises that his work is to write. The final line, however, is in the future tense, to emphasise Heaney's determination -
Heaney remembers his own role in the digging: he and other children would gather the new potatoes that his father dug up, and he was responsible for taking milk to his grandfather on Toner's bog. It was this involvement that enabled him to watch his father and grandfather at work and describe their movements so precisely.
His father was clearly skilled at his work. Heaney remembers him
(line 8) and his boot and his knee fitted the spade perfectly (lines 10/11). He uses technical terms (lug, shaft) to stress that the spade is a precise tool.
""By God, the old man could handle a spade""
(line 15) is a simple, loving exclamation of pride.
He was also proud of his grandfather, who was so keen to work that he hardly stopped when Heaney brought him some milk. His work was precise -

Heaney does not explain exactly why he has
""no spade to follow men like them""
(line 28). Do you think he feels he is not physically strong enough for this type of work? Or that he is no longer emotionally equipped for it, having broken the family tradition of working the land? Does he fear his grandfather and father might not approve of his having left the land?

of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a regretful tone, because Heaney is not outside digging too, and feels he somehow ought to be?
in a proud tone, as Heaney is displaying the skills of his father and grandfather for everyone to appreciate?
in a loving tone, as if the poem is a gift to his father and grandfather?
Well, Heaney's description of his father and grandfather is very loving. He values his sense of connection with them, and he is clearly very proud of the work they did, even though he has
them. Far from regretting his break with the family's traditional work on the land, Heaney asserts that he is continuing their work, by digging with his pen.
The ideas in this poem concern our relationship to our forebears, and to work. Heaney describes his relationship to his father and grandfather purely in terms of their work on the land. He takes the idea of digging, the commonest form of work in any rural community, and uses it as a

Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
There is a sense of Heaney's love of the earth throughout the poem. His father and grandfather seem to be in harmony with the earth; he himself, as a child, loved picking up the potatoes that the earth produced.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
This reminds us that Heaney's father is now an old man, but also shows his fondness for him: old man is a common term of affection. Heaney is clearly proud of him too.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day / than any other man on Toner's bog.
Heaney boasts about his grandfather's skill - he presents him as a champion digger. Perhaps the young Heaney boasted as a child to his friends about his grandfather's ability.

These roots are both actual roots the grandfather's spade cuts through, and Heaney's metaphorical roots in the land and in his family. Even though he doesn't dig with a spade like his father and grandfather, these roots are still alive in his mind.
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems deal with the bonds between the generations - in Clarke's poem a mother addresses her child, while in Heaney's a son talks about his father and grandfather.
Both poems make us think about the relationship between parents (especially fathers) and their children
But in Heaney's poem the relationship is very specific and particular, while in Blake's poem it is not so much a real father, as a symbolic one...
Both poems deal with the relationship between generations, and both describe hard, physical work
But the Old Mother is bitter about the drudgery which she must do; while Heaney's poem celebrates the work as creative.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas, and attitudes and tone
Compare Digging with two other post-1914 poems and one pre-1914 poem of your choice that present the relationship between a parent and child. How do the poets show the nature of the relationships?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Gillian Clark's Catrin, Seamus Heaney's Follower, and William Blake's Little Boy Lost/Little Boy Found.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing Digging with each of these three poems.
Catrin is from mother to a child, while Digging is from a child to a father (and grandfather).
Catrin suggests that relationships between parents and their children are not always harmonious, but Digging shows no conflict.
Catrin explores how a mother and child are bound together through the actual birth; Digging suggests that different generations are bound by sharing the same occupation - Heaney, his father and grandfather all 'dig'.
Both of Heaney's poems show the contrast between his father as an old man and his younger self.
Both describe his expertise in farm work as a means of illustrating Heaney's admiration for is father.
In both poems, the young Heaney is present in the fields, but in Digging he was helpful, gathering in the potatoes, while he was a nuisance in Follower.
There is a determination at the end of Digging to work and explore the past, but there is a hint of frustration in Follower - today It is my father who keeps stumbling Behind me, and will not go away.
Heaney gives us a detailed description of his father and grandfather at work, but we are given no visual impression of the father in Blake's poem.
Blake's boy becomes lost as no father was there, which suggests he was irresponsible, but Heaney shows that his father worked hard to provide food for his family.
Digging suggests a close family relationship. Blake, though, shows the love of the boy's weeping mother and the ever nigh love of God.
Blake's poem implies praise of God ' the father' of us all, while Heaney's poem shows his personal love and respect of his father and grandfather.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

596,2851,"You should know the different types of
The table summarises the main types of electromagnetic radiation and a typical use for each of them.
Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the
of empty space. In a vacuum, they all travel with the same very high speed: 300 000 000 m/s.
A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.

an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
HTML is typically written (or generated) in two ways:
) editor, eg Dreamweaver, iWeb, SeaMonkey Composer etc
An editor like Notepad offers greater control over the code when compared to a WYSIWYG editor because each and every character that forms the HTML and the resulting web page is hand typed. The disadvantage is its a slow process.
The web page is designed, and the content written and styled, using a series of tools. The page can be previewed in the default browser from within the
applications serve a specific purpose, eg Microsoft Word is used for word processing
. This makes building a web page much faster because only a limited knowledge of HTML is needed as its automatically generated. However, the code can still be edited by hand.
Not all browsers render (display) web pages in the same way. Common browsers include:
a web browser developed by Opera Software
W3C is responsible for standardising HTML and releasing updated specifications that revise existing tags, introduce new tags and identify deprecated tags and should be the first reference point for any matters concerning HTML.

598,5617,"Any large-scale economic activity may have a negative impact on the natural environment. Manufacturing industries in particular can cause air, water and noise
The presence of a potentially harmful substance that can reduce quality of a natural resource, such as water, and have knock-on impacts on the environment.
. Industrial pollution can affect the environment in a number of ways:
It may damage the well-being of humans and other species - for example, it can pollute drinking-water supplies or poison plants and animals.
It may interfere with natural processes - for example, it could change local climatic conditions or destroy wildlife habitats.
It may impact on people's livelihoods - for example, pollution of the sea will hurt people who are involved in fishing and tourism.
Some governments have introduced legislation to try to cut down on avoidable pollution and to encourage industries that are more
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
. These laws need to be enforced by courts.
A recent example of courts taking action against a company for causing pollution was in 2004 when a US court ordered the oil company
to pay 2.5bn for an oil spill in 1989.
ran aground while off course. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil contaminating over 1,300 miles of the coast of Alaska. It is estimated that the spill killed as many as 250,000 seabirds, 3,000 sea otters, 300 seals and 22 killer whales.
The court wanted Exxon to pay to help compensate those people in Alaska whose livelihoods were hurt the worst. The 2.5bn pay out is the latest ruling in a long-running court case.

599,3255,"Exam questions on data security will usually ask about methods for keeping data safe and secure.
In a local doctor's surgery, data about the patients is stored in a database on a computer.
Consider two physical precautions that should be taken to keep the data secure.
- the question is asking for the physical precautions you can take to protect data. Keeping the computer area secure and keeping backups in a safe place are both physical precautions. Swipe card entry, locking
a point of access, eg to a computer system
or controlling access to computer areas would also have been good answers.
The doctor needs to see all the information about patients. The receptionist only needs to see some of the information.
Describe one way in which software could restrict access to patient information.
Make it so users must enter a password to gain access to certain areas of the database.
The question is looking for detail about different types of access for different users. This answer clearly highlights the need for having passwords for different levels of access.

600,3656,"These are standard tests to assess how well particular types of
a general term used to describe an application or a program
work. They are used to evaluate new software and hardware releases using a series of scored tests. Many computer magazines publish the test results. A typical test for a printer might be how long it takes to print a page of text.
It's a good way of getting cheap advice on the suitability of one product when compared to what else is available.
Benchmark tests may not include a feature that is really important to a particular end user. In fact they may be based on features the user may not be interested in at all.

604,4312,"The development of steam power was crucial to the Industrial Revolution because it was the main source of power that operated the machinery used in industry.
The developments in equipment helped to increase production, formed the basis of railway transport and introduced new machinery for agriculture.
The Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the steam engine.
in 1696, as many books claim. Saverys engine filled a cylinder with steam, and then cooled it, thereby condensing it. This created a vacuum that sucked up water from the mine.
first used in a mine in Dudley in 1712. He used the vacuum created by condensing the steam to power a piston. The piston was attached to pump rods, which worked a pump to pump out the mines.
took the steam engine and developed it further. The improvements he made created the machine that became the basis of all the power in the Industrial Revolution. Watts inventions included:
cooled the steam by exhausting it into a separate chamber
. The cylinder could, therefore, always be kept hot and the separate condenser always cool. This meant huge amounts of fuel were saved.
Turned the up-and-down motion of the piston into a rotary motion
, which allowed the steam engine to be used to power machinery and wheels.
and used steam pressure to force the piston both ways. This invention became the basis of the steam train.
Regulated the admission of steam into the cylinder
, which not only made the engines safer, but meant they could be kept at a regular speed.

607,1676,"Despite the loss of political and religious freedom,
life improved in Germany for many ordinary people
who were prepared to 'toe the line' and look the other way.
Everybody had a job, and a wage. To people who had been unemployed and starving, 'work and bread' was a wonderful blessing worth every civil liberty they lost.
The Nazis set up KdF (Strength through Joy), which gave workers rewards for their work - evening classes, theatre trips, picnics, and even free holidays.
The Nazis devised a scheme to allow workers to buy a Volkswagen Beetle car for a small weekly payment.
People appreciated the public works - eg new schools and hospitals.
The streets were safe and there was no crime.
Germany was strong and successful in world affairs.
Nazi Youth groups provided activities and holidays for young people.
Nazi ideology gave people hope and confidence.

608,1307,"You will need to use your Ideas about science to:
Distinguish questions that can be answered using a scientific approach from those that cannot. For example, science can answer the question, ""What are the chances of my child having cystic fibrosis?"". However, it cannot answer the question, ""Should I have my pregnancy terminated?""
State clearly what the issue in any debate is. For instance, in a debate about treating genetic diseases with gene therapy, some people think that altering our

is against nature or God. The ethical issue is whether scientists should be allowed to use
treating or preventing disease by introducing or replacing specific genes inside human cells
You will also need to summarise the different views that different people might hold. For example, if gene therapy saves lives, it can only be a good thing. Or, we should not use gene therapy because we do not know the long-term outcomes.
Identify arguments that are based on the right decision, ie a decision that produces the best outcome for most of the people involved. So, if a certain type of gene therapy involves a risk of causing harm, but 90 per cent of the people who have the therapy are cured, is it worth taking the risk?
Identify when certain actions are never justified because they are unnatural or wrong. For example, we could wipe out cystic fibrosis in one generation if we made sure that anyone who was a carrier was not allowed to have children. However, most people would consider this action to be immoral and wrong.

610,2914,"Metals are extracted from ores. An ore is a rock that contains enough of a mineral (metal compound) for the metal to be extracted from it. Most metals are extracted from an ore by reduction with carbon or by electrolysis.
Metals such as zinc, iron and copper are present in ores as their
. Each of these oxides is heated with carbon to obtain the metal.

(s) + 3C(s)  4Fe(l) + 3CO
The source of carbon for this reduction is
, obtained by heating coal in the absence of oxygen. Note that the iron is
when it is formed, due to the very high temperature at which the reaction takes place.
Some metals, such as aluminium, are so
that their oxides cannot be reduced by carbon.
. For example, copper(II) chloride contains positively charged copper ions and negatively charged chloride ions. Ionic substances can be
into the elements they are made from by electricity, in a process called
For electrolysis to work, the ions must be
, the ions break free from the ionic lattice. These ions are then free to move.
For example, if electricity is passed through copper(II) chloride solution, the copper(II) chloride is broken down to form copper metal and chlorine gas.
There is a similar result if electricity is passed through molten copper(II) chloride.
The solution or molten ionic compound is called an
. The negative electrode is called the
, while the positive electrode is called the
Positively charged ions move to the negative electrode. Metal ions are positively charged, so metals are produced at the negative electrode (cathode).
Negatively charged ions move to the positive electrode. Non-metal ions, such as oxide ions and chloride ions, are negatively charged, so gases such as oxygen or chlorine are produced at the positive electrode (anode).

, largely because of the amount of
. The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder, aluminium oxide, from which aluminium can be extracted.
. But first the aluminium oxide must be made
so that electricity can pass through it. Aluminium oxide has a very high melting point (over 2,000C), so it would be expensive to melt it. Instead, it is
, an aluminium compound with a lower melting point than aluminium oxide. The use of cryolite reduces some of the energy costs involved in extracting aluminium.
The diagram shows an aluminium oxide electrolysis tank. Both the negative electrode (cathode) and positive electrode (anode) are made of
forms at the negative electrode and sinks to the bottom of the tank, where it is tapped off.
forms at the positive electrodes. This oxygen reacts with the carbon of the positive electrodes, forming carbon dioxide, and they gradually burn away. Consequently, the positive electrodes have to be replaced frequently, which adds to the cost of the process.

Given the equation for the extraction of a metal, it is possible to calculate the mass of
What mass of iron metal can be made from 5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide?
(s) + 3C(s) = 4Fe(l) + 3CO
C = 12, Fe = 56, O = 16
These relative atomic masses can be used to find the
has the formula mass = (2 x 56) + (3 x 16) = 160
produces 4Fe. Working this out in tonnes gives:
= (2 x 160) = 320 tonnes produces 4Fe = (4 x 56) = 224 tonnes of iron metal.
5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide produces 5 x 224/320 = 3.5 tonnes of iron.
It is also possible to calculate the maximum mass of a metal that can be obtained from a specific mass of ore by comparing their formulae.
contains 2 x 56 = 112 tonnes of Fe
5 tonnes of iron(III) oxide produces 5 x 112/160 = 3.5 tonnes of iron.
During electrolysis, metal ions, which are positive, gain electrons from the negative electrode (cathode) to form
In the extraction of aluminium, this is the equation for the reaction at the
At the positive electrode (anode), non-metal ions, which are negative, lose electrons to form neutral atoms. These atoms join to make molecules of the non-metal element, such as a molecules of oxygen gas.
In the extraction of aluminium, this is the equation for the reaction at the
The removal of electrons from the cathode and addition of electrons to the anode means that an

Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.
fhrt in die Stadt abends, um sich zu unterhalten.

is about a boy walking with his father through marshy land at night. He becomes separated from his father and is obviously in danger. Even the
that might have provided him with some light disappears, so he is left alone in total darkness.
is about the finding of the lost boy, who has been following a 'wandr'ing light'. God appears and leads him back to his mother, who has been searching for him. Strangely, she was searching for him in the dale, not the fen. This could be interpreted as meaning she was in the wrong place and would not have found him without God's help.

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.

is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

616,6002,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.
Clouds of smoke and other combustion products are emitted from chimneys
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
to produce electricity are one of the main contributors of carbon dioxide in the air.
One way to reduce the air pollution caused by power stations is to
. Some ways to do this are:
turning off lights when you leave a room
using a microwave instead of an electric oven
from 2006 about saving energy in the home.
Power stations give out sulfur dioxide which is a cause of
Acid rain is rain that contains a high level of acids. These acids can contaminate drinking water, damage plants and water creatures and buildings. It is believed to be caused by pollution and, maybe, natural activity such as volcanic eruptions.
. The amount of sulfur dioxide given off by a power station can be reduced by:
removing sulfur from natural gas and fuel oil
removing sulfur dioxide from the flue gases emitted by coal-burning power stations
Coal-powered stations give off solid particulates. These can also be removed from the flue gases.
Atmospheric pollution caused by the exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles can be reduced by:
Exhaust gases given out by motor vehicles causes atmospheric pollution
burning less fuel by having more efficient engines
using catalytic converters, which convert nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen and oxygen, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide

622,2893,"There are different opinions about what the Industrial Revolution actually consisted of and what caused it. This Revision Bite will look at some of the arguments that question the definition and timing of the Industrial Revolution.

""The steam engine was one of the most important of mans inventions for without it the Industrial Revolution could never have taken place""
confusion about the nature of the Industrial Revolution
, and where the revolution in the British economy started.
Recently, certain economic historians have claimed that there was
revolutionary change only in the cotton and iron industries
, and that change in other areas of the economy was much slower  so much so, that one economic historian has argued that the period as a whole no longer deserves the title ""Industrial Revolution"".

623,589,"Inspector Goole announces that he has come to investigate the suicide of a young working-class girl who died that afternoon. Her name was Eva Smith. After seeing a photograph of her, Birling admits that she used to be one of his employees: he discharged her when she became one of the ring-leaders of a strike asking for slightly higher wages. Birling justifies sacking her by saying he paid his workers the usual rates; he cannot see that he has any responsibility for what happened to her afterwards.

624,3815,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

many Greek ideas about medicine. These factors slowed down their progress, but they continued to explore new ideas about the causes and prevention of disease.
Roman doctors learned a lot about the human body as they tended gladiators wounded in the amphitheatres. However, dissection of humans was forbidden in the Roman empire, so Roman anatomists such as
to further their knowledge. Galen recommended dissecting monkeys that walked on two legs, like men.
Galen as depicted in a book by the 16th-century French surgeon Ambroise Par
He did manage to work a little with the human body, and described how he had
to dissect when he found a hanged criminal, and when a flood washed some bodies out of a cemetery. Despite this, he made various errors in his analysis of how bodies work.
Galen's books show a good knowledge of bone structure. He also studied the lungs, the muscles, the heart and blood and the nervous system. He conducted experiments on pigs, and when he cut the spinal cord in different places he realised how the
takes messages from the brain to the muscles.
Galen accepted the Greek theory of the
Four bodily fluids - yellow bile, black bile, blood and phlegm - used in ancient times to analyse and describe people's state of health.
as the cause of disease. However, the Romans did not continue the Greeks' investigations into disease and rejected Greek ideas, so Roman knowledge of disease did
Roman ideas about disease were muddled. For example:
Crinas of Massilia thought illness was caused by the stars (astrology).
Varro blamed creatures too tiny to be seen.
Columella blamed poisonous vapours in the swamps.
All these ideas survived until the 19th century.
Galen based most of his information about anatomy on what he saw when he dissected the bodies of animals. This led him to make mistakes. Some of his errors were:
He thought that muscles attach to the bone in the same way in humans and in dogs.
He thought that blood was created in the liver. He realised that it flowed round the body, but said it was burned up as fuel for the muscles.
He thought he saw holes through the septum, which allowed the blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other.
He made mistakes about the blood vessels in the brain.
He thought the human jaw-bone was made up of two bones, like a dog's.

during winter and dry up during summer months.
did not always link the major towns
A rapidly growing population also needed a more efficient method of transport because
canals would be the next step forward
Read this Revision Bite and then attempt to write down the information that you consider to be

628,3160,"(Mishnah and Gemara collected together) describe different roles for men and women.
Traditionally women have a sacred role - they bear children, run the home and take responsibility for their childrens Jewish upbringing. The woman passes on Jewish values and it is because of the mothers Jewish faith (not the fathers) that a child is born Jewish.
While Jewish law excuses women from some religious duties (eg, they dont have to wear the
Fringes on the corners of the Tallit (prayer shawl).
Small leather boxes containing passages from the Torah, strapped to the forehead and arm for morning prayers on weekdays.
) there are some duties that women are obliged to carry out like the lighting the
is the day of spiritual renewal and rest commencing at sunset on Friday, terminating at nightfall on Saturday.)
. Men and women sit separately in Orthodox services and women cannot take an active part in this worship. Some Jewish women today accept these limitations, but they are as well-educated as men and choose to combine a career with family responsibilities.
Progressive Jews (which includes Jews of both liberal and reform traditions) think that this attitude is wrong and treat women equally in all respects, so they too can become rabbis (Jewish teacher) if they choose to do so.

, since poems communicate their meaning in a number of different ways - not just the everyday meaning of the words.
Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
'I rise in the dawn, and I kneel and blow
Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;
And then I must scrub and bake and sweep
Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;
And the young lie long and dream in their bed
Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,
And their day goes over in idleness,
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'
The poem is about a hard-working, poor old woman who compares herself to the young women of the house who spend their days dreaming of love and worrying about their appearance. It is not clear whether these young women are her own children or the children of people she works for as a maid. The poem is written in the

This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

633,1949,"In your German exam you will have to show your reading skills. This exercise will help you understand an article where some students describe where they live.
Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.
fhrt in die Stadt abends, um sich zu unterhalten.
fhrt abends in die Stadt, um sich zu unterhalten.
Eva travels to town to go to the cinema.
Read the text through once, aiming to get a general sense of each paragraph. Don't worry if there are words that you don't understand - look for similarities with English words, for example:
Look for words to do with feelings and comparisons.
Read the question carefully, before you read the text. Look for key words that may give you clues to the answers you need.

You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.
Is minteoir scoile  fosta ach n bheidh s ag obair sa scoil i mbliana. Beidh s ag obair leis an pheil i mbliana. Deir daoine nach mbeidh s ag imirt peile ar an bhliain seo chugainn.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.
- acla; suim mhr sa pheil; Earagail Chiarin agus Tr Eoghain; peileadir iontach maith, sciliil; dograiseach; ag traenil gach l.
- minteoir corpoideachais, menscoil i gCo. Thr Eoghain; N bheidh s ag teagasc i mbliana; obair leis an pheil; an bhliain seo chugainn; r-aosta.
- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.
Sa chur i lthair seo beidh m ag caint ar Pheadar  Ceannabhin. T Peadar  Ceannabhin tr bliana is trocha d'aois. T s measartha beag agus tana ach t s iontach lidir.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

635,2527,"Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
Think about all the different things you need to do for each task, and the order they need to be done in, and add them to your overall plan. Allocate a number to each main task and give each sub-task a number or letter to show which main task it is part of, and where it is in the order. For example:
Task 3: Produce a formal letter to a newspaper explaining why animal experiments might be necessary.
Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
You could write this plan on paper and scan it before saving it on your computer. You could also write it straight onto the computer using a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mind mapping application or other suitable software.

636,707,"Line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams
For the exam, you will need to know how to draw and interpret statistical diagrams including two way tables, line graphs, frequency polygons and stem and leaf diagrams.
Below is an example of a two-way table showing the number of boys and girls in a 6th form college:
We can find out lots of information from this table, for example:
There are 260 girls in the college (120 + 140)
of the boys are in U6 (100 out of 240)
48% of the pupils are boys (
If a girl is chosen at random, the probability that she is in class L6 is
(there are 260 girls, and 120 of them are in L6, so
If a boy is chosen at random, what is the probability that he is in U6?
There are 260 pupils in L6 (140 boys and 120 girls)
Line graphs are made by joining up points plotted on a graph.
This table shows a country's grape production (in thousands ['000s] of tonnes) for the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980 and 1990.
This data can be represented in the form of a line graph as shown below.
Frequency polygons can be used to represent grouped data.
Fifty bags of sweets were opened. The number of sweets in each bag is recorded in the table below:
Represent this information in the form of a frequency polygon.
The frequency polygon is plotted at the
A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below:
This data can be more easily interpreted if we represent it in a
This stem and leaf diagram shows the data above:
The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case, tens and units.
The tens form the stem and the units form the leaves.
This information is given to us in the
It is usual for the numbers to be ordered. So, for example, the row
shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25 and 27 in order.
From the stem and leaf diagram how many children scored more than 40?
6 people had a score of more than 40
To find this look down the ""stem"" to the the column labelled 4, and don't forget to include the child who scored 50!
As well as providing valuable evidence to support your finding, statistics can be misleading. They are often used to prove a point, and can easily be twisted in favour of that point.
Here are some examples of misleading graphs.
What is wrong with this bar chart? How should the information be represented?
From this graph, it looks as though house prices have trebled in one year! It is misleading because the vertical axis does not start at 0. Look at the 'improved' version of the same graph. This gives a much more accurate picture of what has happened.
Although the vertical scale starts at 0, it does not go up in even steps. This distorts the graph, and makes it look as though the biggest jump is between 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4.
Also, there are no labels on the axes, so we have no idea what this graph represents!
What is wrong with this 3D bar chart?
This 3D bar chart might look very attractive, but it is also very misleading. There is no scale on the vertical axis and, because of the perspective, it looks as though sales for 1995 were far greater than those for any other year. In fact, they were identical to those in 1997.
The data would be better represented on a 2D-bar chart, with appropriate labelling on each axis:
What is wrong with this pictogram showing the number of people who own different types of pets?
On this pictogram, there is no category for people who do not own a pet. The pictures are different sizes, and it appears that more people own a horse than any other animal.
An improvement would be to redraw the pictogram, with each of the animals the same size and aligned with one another like this:

Can be used to send out tailored advertisements. For example, someone who regularly buys garden magazines might be sent special offers on garden products.
When customers sign-up they provide their address. This information can be used to see where the customers come from and identify opportunities for new stores.

638,824,"Electricity is a very convenient form of energy that can be generated using different energy resources. Some of these resources are renewable and some are non-renewable. Each resource has advantages and disadvantages.
Energy transfer for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel
when they are burned. They are fossil fuels because they were
formed from the remains of living organisms
About three-quarters of the electricity generated in the UK comes from power stations fuelled by fossil fuels. To the right is an energy transfer diagram for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel such as coal.
Their supply is limited and they will eventually run out
. Fossil fuels do not renew themselves, while fuels such as wood can be renewed endlessly.
, which adds to the greenhouse effect and increases global warming. Of the three fossil fuels, for a given amount of energy released, coal produces the most carbon dioxide and natural gas produces the least.
release sulfur dioxide gas when they burn
, which causes breathing problems for living creatures and contributes to acid rain.

639,5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

641,211,"A 'tropism' is a growth in response to a stimulus. Plants grow towards sources of water and light, which they need to survive and grow.
Auxin is a plant hormone produced in the stem tips and roots, which controls the direction of growth. Plant hormones are used in weedkillers, rooting powder and to control fruit ripening.
to help make sure they grow towards sources of light and water.
 growth in response to the direction of
 growth in response to the direction of
Responses of different parts of the plant
is a plant hormone responsible for controlling the
of root tips and stem tips in response to
of stems and roots. It's moved in solution to older parts of the stem and root where it changes the elasticity of the cells. More elastic cells absorb more water and grow longer, causing bending in the stem or root. It's thought that light and gravity can interfere with the transport of auxin causing it to be unevenly distributed.
3 groups of seeds are grown in a cardboard box.
- when the tips are removed, no auxin is made so the stems do not grow
 when the tips are covered, auxin moves to all parts of the stem causing all parts to grow

643,7121,"The alkali metals - trends in reactivity
As you go down the group, the atomic number of the alkali metals increases, and their properties change:
You will probably see lithium, sodium and potassium at school, but rubidium and caesium are considered to be too reactive to use in the classroom. Francium is radioactive and very rare - there are only a few grams of it in the whole of the Earth's crust at any time.
Reactions of lithium, sodium and potassium with water

646,1147,"The human population is increasing rapidly. This is increasing the use of finite resources such as fossil fuels and minerals. As a result, the amount of waste and pollution is also on the rise. Certain species are endangered - if they are not helped, they are likely to become extinct.
for resources. Before the beginning of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, small groups of humans wandered across large areas, hunting and gathering just enough food to stay alive. Population numbers were kept low because of the difficulty of finding food.
The development of agriculture led to a population explosion that has accelerated enormously during the past 500 years. Unlike other species, humans can
Human population growth over the past 10,000 years
People in the developed world enjoy a high standard of living, with abundant food, cars and comfortable housing. People in the developing world have a lower standard of living, but many countries are catching up quickly.
The worlds human population has passed 6 billion and continues to increase. The growth in the human population and the increase in the standard of living are putting strains on the global environment. Here are some of the ways in which this is happening:
non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, oil and natural gas, are being used up rapidly
raw materials are being used up rapidly
A mountain of household and industrial rubbish
Pollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. Population growth and increases in the standard of living cause more waste to be produced. If this waste is not handled correctly, it leads to pollution. The most obvious form of pollution is often simply just litter on the ground, but pollution can affect the air and water too.
Most rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even common household items can contain
such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium.
is also discharged onto the land. Many farmers apply
chemicals used to kill insects, weeds and micro-organisms that might damage crops
to improve their crops, but these can damage living things. Toxic chemicals can be washed from the land into rivers, lakes and seas.
Spilled crude oil causes a lot of harm to the environment, both sea and land
Water pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas.

animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.
The most common source of air pollution is the combustion of
Fossil fuels, such as coal, gas and oil, are mined from the earth. They are formed from broken down animals and plants that died a very long time ago. Fossil fuels are burnt to produce energy. Often they are used to create electricity. As they can only be used once, these are called finite fuels.
. This usually happens in vehicle engines and power stations.
Deposits soot on buildings and trees, causing them damage. Permeates the air, making it difficult for living creatures to breathe.
greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming
depletes ozone in the upper atmosphere, so damages the ozone layer
Lichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there, and rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens, and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution. For example:
leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution
crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air
In places where no lichens are growing, it's often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.
Individuals that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce than those that are well adapted. Similarly, it is possible that a species that is poorly adapted to its environment will not survive and will become extinct.
Here are some of the factors that can cause a species to become extinct:
changes to the environment, such as a change in climate
since life on Earth began. Extinction is still happening and a lot of it occurs because of human activities. We compete with other living things for space, food and water, and we are very successful predators.
The dodo was a large flightless bird that lived on Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean. The island was uninhabited and the dodo had no natural predators. Then Mauritius was colonised by the Dutch in 1638. Dodos were
and easy to catch because they were not afraid of people. New competitors were brought onto the island, including pigs, cats and rats, which ate the dodos' eggs and their young. Within 80 years, the dodo was
The panda and gorilla are endangered, and may become extinct. Some species in Britain are endangered, too, including the red kite, red squirrel and osprey. They could be helped by measures such as:
legal protection and protection of their habitats
making artificial ecosystems for them to live in
These measures are difficult to implement when dealing with certain organisms, such as whales. These animals live in international waters, so international laws and agreements are needed to protect them.
Fish are an important part of the human diet, accounting for a worldwide average 15% of humans' protein intake. Most of these fish are caught wild, and if fish are caught at a faster rate than the remaining fish can reproduce, the stock of fish will obviously decline. Trying to harvest more fish than the sea can produce is an example of
an activity which uses up resources or damages the environment so that it cannot be continued in the future
Since the 1960s North Sea cod have been overfished, as more and more - and bigger - fishing boats caught more and more cod. At first, catches continued to increase each year. But then - surprise, surprise! - they started to decline, as there were not enough breeding fish left to maintain the cod population. Today, North Sea cod are in danger of extinction.
Humans have now been cutting down trees for around 10,000 years - for wood to burn or build with, or to clear land for farming.
Sustainable means using something or doing something in a way that minimises damage to the environment and which avoids using up natural resources, eg by using renewable rather than scarce resources.
as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after harvesting - but often this is not done. The result is that the area of forest is steadily shrinking - a process called
Deforestation is the destroying of forests by cutting down trees (for timber) or by burning. Often the purpose is to make way for agricultural land.

Particularly worrying is the rapid destruction of
. This type of forest is often referred to as 'the Earth's lungs' because it produces around 40% of the world's atmospheric oxygen. It is also home to an estimated 50% of all species on Earth - once lost, the original habitats can never be replaced. Tropical rainforest is being cut down at the rate of 17 - 20 million hectares a year.
Humans reduce the amount of land and resources available for plants and animals. This happens because of farming, quarrying, dumping waste and building.
Urbanisation means the growth of cities. About
half the worlds population live in cities
, and most of the population growth in the future is expected to take place in cities. It is predicted that by 2015,
the worlds six largest cities will each have more than 20 million inhabitants
. These are some of the effects of urbanisation:
land no longer used for food production
decline of rural towns and villages as people leave them to live in cities
means improving our quality of life without damaging the quality of life of future generations. It is important to all of us, not just the other inhabitants of the planet, that sustainable development is achieved. This involves each of us as individuals, and careful planning at local, regional and global levels.

647,3753,"The arrival of the railway network had a huge impact on Britain. The railways gave people the ability to travel around the country quickly and made different areas more accessible.
The railways brought social, political and economic changes.
Once railways were established as Britain's newest and fastest communication and transport system, they started to have a number of effects on Britain. These effects can be put into three main categories:
- people becoming more aware of political movements and national news.
- improving the financial side of Britain.
Within 40 years, the arrival of trains had made a big impact on Britain and some of these changes can still be seen today.
The rail construction industry created new jobs

648,7341,"When there is a chemical reaction, air pollutants are produced. You can understand how these pollutants are formed by looking at what happens to atoms during these chemical reactions.
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
tells you how many atoms of each element the molecule contains. The table below shows the formulae of some compounds, together with the number of atoms of each element in each molecule and a diagram of each molecule.
The table shows the formulae of some compounds, with the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
A small (subscript) number after a symbol tells you how many atoms of that particular element are in the molecule. If there is only one atom of an element in a molecule, we do not write the number 1 after the symbol. For example, the water molecule H

649,6210,"Evidence for the Big Bang - higher
There are two key pieces of evidence for Big Bang theory. Theses are
You may have noticed that when an ambulance or police car goes past, its siren is high-pitched as it comes towards you, then becomes low-pitched as it goes away. This effect, where there is a change in frequency and wavelength, is called the Doppler effect. It happens with any wave source that moves relative to an observer.
This happens with light too. Our sun contains helium. We know this because there are black lines in the spectrum of the light from the sun, where helium has absorbed light. These lines form the absorption spectrum for helium.
When we look at the spectrum of a distant star, the absorption spectrum is there, but the pattern of lines has moved towards the red end of the spectrum, as you can see below.
This is called red shift. It is a change in frequency of the position of the lines.
Astronomers have found that the further from us a star is the more its light is red shifted. This tells us that distant galaxies are moving away from us, and that the further a galaxy is the faster it is moving away. Since we cannot assume that we have a special place in the universe this is evidence for a generally expanding universe. It suggests that everything is moving away from everything else. The Big Bang theory says that this expansion started billions of years ago with an explosion.
Scientists discovered that there are microwaves coming from every direction in space. Big Bang theory says this is energy created at the beginning of the universe, just after the Big Bang, and that has been travelling through space ever since.
A satellite called COBE has mapped the background microwave radiation of the universe as we see it. Big Bang theorists are still working on the interpretation of this evidence.
A summary of some of the evidence of the Big Bang and its interpretation
The light from other galaxies is red-shifted.
The other galaxies are moving away from us.
The further away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.
The most likely explanation is that the whole universe is expanding. This supports the theory that the start of the universe could have been from a single explosion.
The relatively uniform background radiation is the remains of energy created just after the Big Bang.
For an activity that is out of this world!

The Birling family are holding a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of Sheila to Gerald Croft, the son and heir of Mr Birling's rival in business. Although there are a few signs that not
is perfect (Mr Birling is a bit too anxious to impress Gerald, Eric seems rather nervous and Sheila playfully rebukes Gerald for not having come near her the previous summer) there is a happy, light-hearted atmosphere.
When the ladies leave the men to their port, Mr Birling has a 'man to man' chat with Gerald and Eric, advising them that a man needs to look after himself and his own family and not worry about the wider community. As he is telling them this, the door bell rings. Inspector Goole enters, an impressive, serious man whom none of them has heard of.

Renaissance knowledge about the body and disease
The Early Modern Age was an exciting time for medicine, with knowledge of the human body progressing in fundamental ways - although the causes of disease remained a mystery.
Two key practitioners moved knowledge forwards in the Early Modern Age:
Follower of Vesalius in graveyard, searching for bodies to dissect
, whose patron was Charles V of Spain. He trained at Louvain, Paris and Padua universities, and ransacked cemeteries and gibbets for bones and for bodies to dissect.
. He also realised that the famous doctor Galen could be wrong, when he discovered that the great man was mistaken about there being two bones in the jaw, and about how muscles were attached to the bone.
He became professor of medicine at Padua University. He said that medical students should perform
""... our true book of the human body is man himself.""
He published 'Fabric of the Human Body' (with high-quality annotated illustrations).
- who discovered the principle of the
through the body. He trained at Cambridge and Padua universities, and became doctor to James I and Charles I of England.
He calculated that it was impossible for the blood to be burned up in the muscles (as Galen had claimed).
He published 'Anatomical Account of the Motion of the Heart and Blood', which scientifically proved the principle of the circulation of the blood. This book marked the end of Galen's influence on anatomy.

have limited amounts of the resources needed by the living organisms who live in them. Animal (including humans) and plant organisms can only survive if they can get enough resources from their habitat, and they must compete with other organisms for these resources. If they are unsuccessful and cannot move to another habitat, they will die.
Here are some of the resources that animals compete for:
Animals may also compete for mates, so that they can reproduce.

Human beings are very successful organisms. We compete with other animals and with plants all over the world. For example, our farmers compete with animals and plants for water and space, and with animals for food.

655,5867,"Using life cycle assessments (Ideas about science)
The use of a life cycle assessment, or LCA, may involve studying social and economic circumstances, sustainability, regulations and laws. These can help you to make an informed decision about the use of a material or product.
When using a life cycle assessment to make decisions about the use of a material or product, it is important to:
know that some questions can be addressed using a scientific approach, and some cannot
be able to identify the groups of people who may be affected, and the main benefits and costs of a course of action for each group
be able to explain whether the use of the material is sustainable
recognise that there are regulations and laws that control scientific research and applications
Read on if you are taking the
Feasibility and course of action - higher only
When using a life cycle assessment to make decisions about the use of a material or product, it is important to be able to:
distinguish what should be done (values) from what can be done (feasibility)
explain why different decisions, or courses of action, may be taken in different social and economic contexts

656,1135,"These are the steps in selective breeding:
from parents to breed the next generation
wheat by crossbreeding wheat plants with disease resistance and wheat plants with a high yield.
by selecting bulls from high yield herds and breeding them with cows that have the best milk production.
Selective breeding can also be used to modify other characteristics of cattle.
Aberdeen Angus bull - bred for beef
Problems with selective breeding - higher tier
Future generations of selectively bred organisms will all share very
more dangerous as all the organisms would be affected. Also there's increased risk of genetic disease caused by
Some genes would be lost, making it more difficult to produce new varieties in the future. In scientific language this would be described as inbreeding can lead to a reduction in the size of the gene pool.

657,5674,"When chemicals react with each other, different chemicals are made. One of the best ways to describe what is happening is by writing a chemical equation.
A chemical equation tells you which chemicals reacted together (the
) and the new chemicals that were made in the reaction (the
The simplest equation is a word equation. For example:
A symbol equation gives more information about what is happening in the reaction:
Each of the reactants and products is shown as a formula. This formula shows how many atoms of each element are present.
The formula for sodium is Na - the same as its symbol.
, because the halogens exist as molecules of two atoms (
Each of the Group 1 halides has a formula with one symbol for the metal and one for the halogen. So, for sodium chloride the formula is NaCl.
The numbers in front of the formulae are there to
the equation. This gives the same number of atoms of each element on each side of the equation.
For the exam you will be expected to know the following formulae:
Halides of Group 1 metals - for example:
Hydroxides of Group 1 metals - for example:
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

There are many types of adhesives to suit different materials. When you are choosing the right one for your product you will have to take into consideration the type of material, the strength of the bond required and the environment the product will work in - for example if you are gluing timber for outdoor use, you would not use polyvinyl acetate (PVA), because it is water soluble.
will join almost anything to anything. It is widely used in industry, for example, many parts of aircraft are held together with double-sided tape!
Joining wood 1: screws, nails, glues and knock-downs
There are many different ways of making joints in wood. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength required and the quality of the product. Temporary fixings will often be done using fastening components such screws or bolts. More permanent joints can be achieved with glue, or with nails - though these may lack strength and be rough-and-ready in appearance.

of the screw - so that the core fits tightly into it.
Screws come with different types of head. They can be flat or round-headed, and be fitted with a slot (for traditional screwdrivers), crosses (for Phillips or Posidrive screwdrivers) or square holes (for square drivers). If the screw head is to lie flush with the surface of the wood, the hole must be enlarged or
are made from very hard steel. They have a thread which goes all the way up to the head, and cut an internal thread as they are screwed in. They can be used in metal and plastic as well as wood. Machine screws are used for joining metal and plastic components.
Nails come in different shapes and sizes. Nails are much cheaper than screws and quick to put in. You do not need to drill holes in the wood first, except sometimes when using hard wood or to prevent the wood splitting.
When using wood glue, make sure you:
Get the surfaces to be glued to fit well - no gaps!
Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.
Get everything ready before you start - glue, brush, damp cloth, clamps and blocks to protect your work.
Don't start to glue up unless you are sure you have enough time - you can't stop half way through!

As with wood, there are many ways of joining metal permanently. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength needed and the quality of the product.
Brazing is a way of bonding materials (usually metals) by melting a filler metal or alloy between the components you want to join. The filler metals used in brazing usually have melting points between 450C and 1000C, but must have a lower melting point than the material being joined. Brazing forms very strong, permanent joints.

The solder flows into the heated metal along the joint, distributes itself by capillary action, and grips the two pieces together when it all cools.

Welding is different from soldering in that the two pieces of metal are themselves melted along the joints, fusing together as they cool. In

660,4377,"Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide.
Steel and aluminium have advantages and disadvantages when used to make cars, which are recycled to re-use valuable materials and cut down on waste.
Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. Both water and oxygen are needed for rusting to occur. In the experiment below, the nail does not rust when air - containing oxygen - or water is not present:
Calcium chloride absorbs water in the right-hand test tube
Salt dissolved in water does not cause rusting, but it does speed it up, as does acid rain.
Aluminium does not rust - corrode. Its surface is protected by a natural layer of aluminium oxide. This prevents the metal below from coming into contact with air and oxygen.
Unlike rust, which can flake off the surface of iron and steel objects, the layer of aluminium oxide does not flake off.
reaction. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to form
, which we see as rust. Here is the word equation for the reaction:
iron + water + oxygen    hydrated iron(III) oxide
Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.
Cars are complex machines. Many different materials are used in their manufacture.
The main materials used in the manufacture of cars
tough and easily moulded to desired shape

European Union law requires that at least 85 per cent of a cars materials can be recycled, rising to 95 per cent by 2015. Recycling reduces the amount of waste, and the use of natural resources.

661,1835,"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to
microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses
, and therefore its ability to stay fresh.
Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.
Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

662,3606,"In a bid to improve roads, the first Turnpike Trusts were set up in 1663. These organisations introduced tolls on roads and aimed to use the money raised to maintain the roads. However, the Turnpike Trust scheme still had its problems.
The first attempt in Britain to improve roads started in 1663. This was when the Turnpike Trust was set up. The trusts had one simple aim:
to charge people to use newly improved roads
and then the money raised from the tolls was used to pay for the upkeep of the roads.
who were sometimes more interested in making a profit than maintaining the good condition of roads for their customers. The businessmen had to get an Act of Parliament passed to build their turnpike and had to employ professional road surveyors, treasurers and reputable road engineers.
A carriage passes through the toll gate while engineers survey the road
As you can see from the illustration, the road engineers built
gates across the entrance of the roads
and then toll keepers collected tolls from people using the roads. People were charged different tolls depending on the method of transport they were using. This money was then meant to be used to maintain the roads.
Some trusts did maintain their roads and
(such as Thomas Telford) to build straighter and better roads. However, people who had always used local roads did not like suddenly having to now pay for the same route. For example, during the Rebecca Riots in Wales (1842-44) rioters dressed as women burned down toll keepers' cottages and tollgates in protest at road tolls.
out of a possible 120,000 miles were improved by Turnpikes.
and many minor roads were still in a bad condition.
Trusts began to care more about making a profit than the upkeep of road surfaces and often tried to charge
along routes to make extra money and this began to slow down people's journeys.
from roads as Britain's quickest and cheapest form of transport.
To make sure that you are clear about the changes that took place with roads look back at the diagram and then try to recreate it on a piece of paper.
As part of your revision, think about the
the toll money was meant to be spent on roads.
local people may have been upset about the new Turnpikes.

667,1227,"There are already ways in which we can reduce the air pollution caused by the burning of fuels, and others may be developed in the future. New applications that result from scientific research are subject to official regulations and laws.
Coal is an example of a fossil fuel
The fossil fuels include coal, natural gas and the products from the fractional distillation of crude oil, such as petrol and diesel. When any fossil fuel is burned, one of the combustion products is carbon dioxide.
amounts of fossil fuels have been burned each year. This has led to an increase in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. Many scientists believe this is causing
Global warming refers to the rise in the average temperature of the Earth's surface. In the last 100 years it is believed to have risen by 0.6 degrees C. There are estimates that in the next 100 years, the global temperatures could rise by as much as 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.
One way to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is to burn
fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we depend on the burning of fossil fuels for heating, electricity generation and transport. If we are to burn less fossil fuels, we will need alternatives for these essential activities.

670,7504,"Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA).
The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.
in the same places. But there are different versions of the same gene.
Different versions of the same gene are called
, which is pronounced al-eels. For example, the gene for eye colour has an allele for blue eye colour and an allele for brown. For any gene, a person may have the same two alleles, or two different ones.
Alleles may be either recessive or dominant.
allele only shows if the individual has two copies of it. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of this allele to have blue eyes.
allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of it. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of it to have brown eyes. Two copies will still give you brown eyes.
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Only individual C will have blue eyes, because the allele for blue eyes is recessive.
because, even though they have brown eyes, they still carry the allele for blues eyes and can pass this allele on to future generations.

672,7523,"Listen to the poem and watch the slideshow
The poem seems to be spoken by a BBC newsreader.
He or she explains why the BBC thinks it is important to read the news in a 'BBC accent': no one will take the news seriously if it's read with a 'voice lik/wanna yoo/scruff'.
He or she speaks here in the accent of an ordinary speaker/viewer - just the kind of voice the newsreader is rejecting.
A newsreader would never really reveal his or her prejudices directly to the viewer in this way. So what the newsreader 'says' in this poem perhaps needs to be seen as the unspoken message (or
) of the way the news is presented.
Formal, official, 'book-English'. The opposite of dialect or slang.
. Would it carry the same 'trooth'?

673,6205,"The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases. They belong to the right-hand column in the periodic table. The noble gases are all chemically unreactive which means they are
The noble gases have the following properties in common:
they exist as single atoms (they are monatomic)
The main uses of the noble gases
Used in balloons and airships. It is much less dense than air, so balloons filled with it float upwards.
Used in advertising signs. It glows when electricity is passed through it, and different coloured 'neon lights' can be made by coating the inside of the glass tubing with other chemicals.
Used in light bulbs. The very thin metal filament inside the bulb would react with oxygen and burn away if the bulb were filled with air instead of argon. As argon is unreactive, it stops the filament burning away.

For your exam, you will need to feel confident when dealing with fractions. This section will help you to recognise equivalent fractions and practise simple calculations.
It is easy to add fractions when the numbers on the bottom are the same.
All you need to do is add the tops of the fractions together.
Sometimes you need to cancel down the answer to its simplest terms.
When the numbers on the bottom are not the same to start with, you use equivalent fractions to make them the same.
The numbers on the bottom of the fractions are not the same. You can use equivalent fractions to make them both equal 20.
You subtract using the same methods you use for adding.
8 and 10 both divide into 40. So re-write the fractions using 40 as the number on the bottom of each one.

675,2210,"Public health is about avoiding the spread of disease within a particular society - often through providing water to help people keep themselves, their animals and their surroundings clean. The Egyptians stressed the importance of cleanliness, but this was for
reasons, not in order to keep the population at large healthy.
Archaeologists have discovered that the Egyptians had simple baths and toilets. Egyptian men and women took great care over their
and appearance, and there is evidence that they used eye make-up that helped protect their eyes from diseases. They slept under mosquito nets.
, kept themselves scrupulously clean. They regularly washed themselves, their clothes and their cups.
The Egyptians didn't use cleanliness to ward off disease, however, but instead
a public health system in the modern sense of state-organised sewers, public hygiene or medical care.

are the dominant factors in determining which crops will grow and which animals are suited to the landscape.
Arable farming is common in the south-east where the summers are warm and the land is low, flat and fertile. The south-east also has good transport links and farms are close to markets in towns and cities such as London.
Human factors such as finance and proximity to markets are important to market gardening. It is common in East Anglia where fruit, vegetables and flowers are grown.
Hill sheep farming takes place in the north and west of Britain in highland areas such as Snowdonia and the Lake District. There are cool summers and high rainfall. The climate and steep land make these areas unsuitable for growing crops.
Dairy farming is common in the south-west and the west of England where the climate is warm and wet. There are also good transport links and good access routes to markets in these areas. The land may be flat or hilly, but not too steep.
Mixed farming is found in areas where the climate and relief suit both crops and animals. It needs to be warm, but not too wet, and the soils need to be fertile and flat. Mixed farms need good transport links and accessibility to markets.

680,1822,"You should know some of the factors affecting the stopping distance of a car.
It takes a certain amount of time for a driver to react to a hazard and start applying the brakes. During this time, the car is still moving. The faster the car is travelling, the greater this thinking distance will be.
The thinking distance will also increase if the driver's reactions are slower because they are:
The braking distance is the distance the car travels from where the brakes are first applied to where the car stops. If the braking force is too great, the tyres may not grip the road sufficiently and the car may skid. The faster the car is travelling, the greater the braking distance will be.
The braking distance will also increase if:
The weather conditions are poor, such as an icy or wet road.
The car is more heavily laden, for example, with passengers and luggage.
The stopping distance is the thinking distance added to the braking distance. The graph shows some typical stopping distances.

In India people hope to have their funeral at the burning ghats on the shores of the sacred river Ganga (Ganges). Here the body is placed on a large pile of wood, then the eldest son says the appropriate Vedic prayers and lights the fire. Incense and ghee (cooked and clarified butter) are poured into the flames.
Prayers are said for the dead person:
O Supreme light, lead us from untruth to truth, from darkness to light and from death to immortality.
Afterwards the ashes of the deceased are sprinkled on water. Many people take the ashes to India to put on the waters of the Ganga; others may take them to the sea near to where they live.
After the funeral the widow or widower will wear white as a sign of mourning. The close family may mourn for twelve days.

. During this, riceballs and milk are offered to the deceased to show the gratitude of the family for the life of that person. After this, the mourners can continue with their normal lives. It is not wrong to mourn for too long, as Hindus believe that each death brings the

682,4269,"On October 29 1929, millions of dollars were wiped out in an event that became known as the Wall Street Crash. It led to the Depression in America which crippled the country from 1930 - 1936. People lost their life savings when firms and banks went bust, and 12 - 15 million men and women - one third of America's population - were unemployed.

683,4254,"The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]
See if you can do it better than Einstein!

685,1264,"The French Wars between 1793 and 1815 had a knock-on effect on British agriculture. The price of wheat soared when the French blockaded ships carrying supplies to Britian, but what were the social, economic and political effects of the French Wars on British agriculture?
Between 1793 and 1815 Great Britain went to war with France. British farmers experienced a time of
during the war because French wheat was no longer imported into Britain. This was because Napoleon was attempting to starve the country by stopping (blockading) ships delivering wheat to Britain.
Britain had not been able to grow enough food to feed the growing population under the open-field system. From 1750 onwards, the country had been forced to rely on
mainly from France to feed the population.
During the French Wars, the price of bread in Britain rose because there was not enough wheat coming from abroad.
made landowners and tenant farmers realise that if they could change their farming methods and grow more food, then they would be able to sell more wheat and make more profits.
During the French war, Britain relied on home-grown wheat
Effects of the French Wars on agriculture
The French Wars had social, economic and political effects on British agriculture:
- the British population almost doubled during the French Wars and this created a higher demand for food. During the war years, early wheat yields could not satisfy British demand and farmers had to change their farming methods to make a profit.
- landowners were certain that the more grain they produced, then the more profit they would make. They borrowed money from banks to improve their land and used new techniques, which increased their crop yields. Farmers paid high interest rates to get loans, but their profit made it worthwhile. The amount of British grain produced increased by 40 per cent during the French Wars.
- during the French Wars, the price of British bread rose much faster than wage increases. Rising food prices and the loss of common land caused by enclosures left squatters and labourers with hardly any food to survive on.
Remember - the French Wars made British landowners and tenant farmers very rich, but when the war ended, they became very worried that cheap grain exports would start to arrive from France once again. This would cost them money.
To help remember the effects of the French Wars try to sort them into the social, economic and political ways that they affected different areas of Britain:

So in Act 2, Scene 1 Iago sees Cassio take Desdemona's hand and his asides tells us he has decided to 'ensare' Cassio with 'tricks', which is exactly what he does later on.

690,5727,"The poem is about the experience of crossing Westminster Bridge early in the morning and seeing the calmness and beauty of the city of London. The poem describes the city in a very positive way, communicating its power and 'splendour'.
Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.

691,1989,"Electricity is a convenient source of energy and can be generated in a number of different ways. You will need to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of other ways of producing energy, such as the use of nuclear power stations.
Coal, oil and natural gas are primary energy sources. Electricity is a secondary energy source because we use primary energy sources to produce it. These primary sources can be non-renewable or renewable. Electricity itself is neither non-renewable nor renewable.
it is transmitted easily over distance, through electricity cables

692,5421,"There are two types of timber: softwood and hardwood.
usually come from coniferous trees - that is, evergreen, needle-leaved, cone-bearing trees such as fir and pine. They do not have the hard cell structure that gives hardwood trees their name.
come from broad-leaved, deciduous trees, and are more important in Design and Technology than softwood timbers. The main hardwood timbers are ash, beech, birch, cherry, elm, iroko, mahogany, meranti, oak, obeche, sapele and teak.
The table lists the properties and uses of these hardwood timbers.
Light, creamy brown. Europe & North America
a wood with visible large pores - eg oak
able to withstand blows or sudden shocks without breaking.
capable of being bent or flexed many times without breaking
a wood with no visible large pores - eg beech
able to resist wear, scratching and indentation.
able to withstand a force without breaking or bending.
bends or twists out of shape, this is common with wood
Some furniture, especially chairs; toys; wooden parts of tools
Fairly soft and easy to work. Open grain
the grains have a weave like structure, the wood is often suitable for bending
able to withstand wear, especially as a result of weathering.
Pink-to-reddish brown. Central & South America, West Africa
Fairly strong and durable. Splits easily when sawing
Light brown. Europe, Japan & North America
Very strong, hard and tough. Open grain. Will corrode steel screws and fittings
Soft, light, not very durable, straight, open grain
Some parts of furniture; the core of plywood
Hard and closed grained, often stripy grain pattern
Golden brown. India & South Eastern Asia
Hard, very strong and durable. Very resistant to acids and moisture

693,168,"In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 2, Scene 1 (which finishes with Macbeth killing Duncan). You would probably want to include details from the plot like:
How Macbeth and his wife have secretly agreed to kill Duncan
How trouble is predicted at the start of the act (with Banquo saying he can't sleep and having 'cursed thoughts')
How Macbeth greets Banquo as a 'friend' when he is really a traitor
How Macbeth denies he has been thinking of the witches and their predictions (so we already know he is a liar)
How leaving Macbeth alone puts the focus directly on him and his thoughts
How Macbeth is relying on his wife for the signal to kill Duncan (just as he relied upon her for the courage to kill him)
How we do not see the murder, so are in the same position as Lady Macbeth - can we be sure Duncan is dead?
How the murder affects all the other characters in the play

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.
Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

698,6456,"Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs.
point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level.
The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable.
Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. These include:
Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance.
Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs
These change according to output eg raw materials.
include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced.
By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the
Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs.
The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs.
You need to establish how many units are to be produced.
You need to know the selling price of the units.
Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation.
These do not change as output changes, eg rent.
These change according to output eg raw materials.
You may find it helpful to work through the
Here is how to work out the breakeven point, using the example of a firm manufacturing compact discs. You can assume the firm has the following costs:
You first construct a chart with output (units) on the horizontal (x) axis, and costs and revenue on the vertical (y) axis. On to this, you plot a horizontal fixed costs line (it is horizontal because fixed costs don't changewith output).
Then you plot a variable cost line from this point, which will, in effect, be the total costs line. This is because the fixed cost added to the variable cost gives the total cost. To do this, you multiply:
variable cost per unit  number of units
In this example of the CD manufacturing firm, you can assume that the variable cost per unit is 2 and there are 2 000 units = 4,000
Once you have done this, you are ready to plot the
The value of sales at a given output ie sales price multiplied by output.
sales price  number of units (output)
If the sales price is 6.00 and 2.000 items were to be manufactured, the calculation is:
6.00  2,000 = 12,000 total revenue
Where the total revenue line crosses the total costs line is the breakeven point (ie costs and revenue are the same). Everything below this point is produced at a loss, and everything above it is produced at a profit.
Fixed costs: 10,000, Variable costs: 2 per unit, Sales price: 6 per unit
If you read downwards, it tells you how many units you need to produce and sell at this price to breakeven: 2,500 CDs
If you read across, it tells you how much money you must spend before you recover your outlay: 15,000
As with any calculation, it is easy to make a mistake. There are two simple equations you can use to double-check your answer. You can calculate the breakeven point in:
Either way, the result should be the same.
For the breakeven point in costs/revenue, you then multiply the breakeven point in units, which you have just calculated, by the sales price.
If you look at the breakeven chart, you will see this is the correct answer.
Breakeven analysis is a favourite exam topic. In an exam, you could be asked to complete a breakeven chart. With these two equations, you'll be able to double check your calculations, get them right and improve your marks.
Use the example of the CD manufacturer above and plot your own chart with the same costs, but this time with a different total revenue line:
You should have calculated a breakeven point of 2,000 units and a costs revenue of 14,000.
If you have made a mistake, calculate the breakeven point in units, and then in costs/revenue again and double check your calculations again.

699,4317,"Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
