Both the United States and Russia are worried about polar bears. Russia is a large country in Europe and Asia. Many polar bears are hunted each year. Some people eat polar bear meat. Others sell polar bear fur to be used for rugs. The United States and Russia fear that the number of polar bears is dropping too quickly.
Recently, both countries agreed to protect polar bears. People in each country can hunt only a small number of polar bears each year. They can no longer hunt female bears or
Now that both countries have signed the agreement, there may soon be more polar bears.

9,198,"Learn about a woman who followed her dream
Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A
is a small bird that is usually yellow.
Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.
What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?

10,399,"For kids in parts of Africa, it is also a way to get clean water to their communities. How? The merry-go-rounds pump water out of the ground. They are called PlayPump water systems.
Kids in Africa play on a PlayPump merry-go-round. It pumps clean water out of the ground.
People need clean water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Many people around the world do not have clean water. In some parts of Africa, women and girls have to walk miles to get clean water.
People are raising money now for more PlayPump systems. By 2010, they hope to have 4,000 PlayPumps in Africa.
The PlayPump water is stored in a tank. Now it is easy for people to get clean water.

11,96,"Do you wear headgear when you play soccer? Some parents think you should. That is because many kids use their heads to hit soccer balls. This is called ""heading.""
Some doctors say that heading can hurt your brain. A group of parents has made special helmets and headbands to protect kids' heads. A middle school in Wisconsin is having its soccer team wear the special headgear while playing soccer.
Soccer coaches give these tips for safely heading a ball:
Keep your eyes open and on the ball.
Head the ball with your forehead, which is the thickest part of your skull.
Be careful not to let the ball hit your face.

12,446,"Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina.
The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees.
The event was a great success, says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.

15,472,"Scientists from the United States are studying elephants in Africa. They say elephants make sounds that cannot be heard by humans. Now those scientists have found a way to study the sounds and what the sounds mean.
In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear.
Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help.
Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled.
Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest.
The African elephant is the largest animal that lives on land. African elephants can weigh up to 16,000 pounds.
An elephant's trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles. The trunk is used to smell, breathe, touch, eat, drink, and bathe.
An angry or frightened elephant can run about 25 miles per hour.
Move over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia.
The elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants. Workers will buy milk to feed elephants that have lost their mothers.

18,5,"Some ants live in special plants known as ant plants. Those plants have
parts where the ants can live. Something that is hollow has empty space inside. The ants help the plants by killing insects that eat the plants.
Scientists recently found that some ants can harm plants. The ants attack plants that do not have hollow parts. The ants dig tunnels in the plants to make nests. Why? Scientists say that when the ants run out of space in ant plants, they make room in other plants.
This ant and plant get along well. The ant lives inside the plants hollow parts. The ant kills insects that eat the plant.

19,377,"Lighters are not toys. Some lighters are made to look like toys, though. They are dangerous. Kids have played with them and started fires. Some kids have gotten hurt.
This may look like a toy, but it is not a toy.
Fire officials want to keep kids safe. They want states to
the sale of the lighters. To ban is to stop with a rule or a law. Maine became the first state to pass such a law, in 2008. Since then, about 13 other states have done the same.
Lighters should only be handled by adults, says Tom Olshanski. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Fire Administration. That group focuses on fire safety. Fire burns, he says. We will continue to work until all 50 states ban the sale of these lighters.

Grab your raincoat and boots! Spring is here. That means warmer, rainy weather in some parts of the United States. Read the answers to some questions about wet weather.
A few wet drops land on your head. Its raining! Rain falls from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny bits of water and ice. The bits grow bigger as they join together. Some get so heavy that they fall to the ground. The ice melts if the air is warmer along the way. The raindrops reach the ground as water.
. Those are storms with heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. As lightning strikes, it heats the air around it. That causes the air to
, or get bigger. When that happens, you hear a loud sound called thunder.
When it rains, you may see a rainbow. It appears when sunlight passes through drops of water in the air. The drops break up the sunlight into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Why? Sunlight is always made up of those colors. They look white when they are together. The drops of water separate each color.

26,269,"The Pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock, December 1620.
landed at the place that is now Massachusetts. There were 101 Pilgrims aboard the ship. After some time, the Pilgrims built a town called Plymouth. Read below to learn more.
The Pilgrims landed near the area where the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg) people already lived. The Wampanoag people knew how to stay safe during cold winters. They made homes called
(weh-TOOZ) to protect themselves from the cold. They also made warm clothing from deerskin.
The Pilgrims arrived close to wintertime. That winter was very cold, and many Pilgrims died. When spring came, a Wampanoag man named Squanto helped the Pilgrims. He showed them where to hunt, and he taught them how to grow corn. This helped the Pilgrims get food to eat.
When the fall harvest came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food to eat! They were very thankful for Squanto's help. Together, the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people had a harvest celebration. For three days, people ate, played games, and told stories to celebrate and give thanks.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division [reproduction number LC-USZC4-4961]
That harvest celebration helped start the American tradition of Thanksgiving. Today, people still share food with their families and friends on this holiday. People also play games, tell stories, and spend time together to show they are thankful. Many people travel to be together on Thanksgiving too.
How do you show you are thankful?

31,247,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.

33,113,"Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii.
is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.

37,210,"What is the difference between the two groups?
A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells.
Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards.
Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes.
An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians.
Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land.
For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land.

40,595,"How do stinkbugs and burrower bugs send messages? They use plants like telephone lines! That is what a new study shows. The insects drum on leaves and stems. They also shake their bodies. That makes the plants vibrate. Other insects hear the vibrations.
To do the study, scientists watched 21 species of stinkbugs and burrower bugs. The scientists measured the tiny vibrations using a laser. They learned that different species have their own vibration patterns. Males and females of the same species have different patterns too.
A stinkbug uses a leaf to send vibrations to other stinkbugs.

41,545,"Tagging horseshoe crabs increases our understanding of their migration, survival, and abundance.
The horseshoe crab population in the United States is going down. Scientists say that too many horseshoe crabs are being caught by fishermen. Fishermen use horseshoe crabs to catch fish.
Scientists fear that many animals will be endangered if there are too few horseshoe crabs. Many animals eat horseshoe crabs.
To help the horseshoe crab, the government has made a rule saying how many crabs each state can catch. States must not catch more than that number. Scientists say the rule may mean there will be more horseshoe crabs soon.

44,66,"Hundreds of butterflies will spend the winter in New York City. The butterflies will live in the American Museum of Natural History. The museum has a special room for the butterflies. There are trees, grass, and plants in the room.
Many of the butterflies are from warm rain forests in places like Africa and Asia. So the temperature in the butterfly room is kept at 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Powerful lamps shine down from the ceiling like the sun shines in a rain forest.
Visitors to the museum can walk along a pathway through the special room. The butterflies often land on the visitors. People get a close-up look at the butterflies.

47,578,"Gauri Nanda had trouble getting up in the morning. Her alarm clock would ring, and she would press the snooze button. Then she would not wake up on time.
One day, Nanda had an idea. She invented an alarm clock with wheels. She named it Clocky. Now people can use Clocky to help them wake up on time.
 A person hits the clocks snooze button, and the clock moves away.
 It can roll off a night table and move across the bedroom.
 As the clock moves, it beeps its alarm! That means that a person must get out of bed to find the clock.

49,388,"Just where the mighty Amazon, a river located in South America, starts had been a mystery. But a team of explorers has found the answer.
The team says the Amazon begins on a mountain named Nevado Mismi. The mountain is in the country of Peru and is 18,363 feet high. It is part of the Andes mountain range.
Freezing temperatures, strong winds, and rocky land made the mountain trip difficult for the explorers. They traveled by foot, car, bicycle, and even horseback. Even though the trip was hard, the team is happy to have solved the mystery.

50,393,"Casey Martin is a professional golfer. But Martin has a disease that makes walking painful for him. So he would like to ride in a golf cart between shots during golf games.
Members of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) think it would be unfair to let Martin ride in a cart. They say that part of the competition in a golf match is walking the golf course. Some matches last four days, and players walk about 25 miles.
Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether Martin can use a golf cart. The Supreme Court is the most important court in the United States. In January, the justices of the Court listened to what Martin and the PGA had to say about using the golf cart. The Court plans to make a decision by July.

51,510,"Goats are helping to prevent forest fires.
Goats are doing their part to help prevent forest fires. Goats eat tall grass, weeds, and small branches. Those plants often spread forest fires in places such as California and Florida.
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.
In 1999, there were about 94,000 forest fires in the United States.
Forest fires in 1999 burned nearly 9,500 square miles of land in the United States.
Most forest fires are started by people. People are sometimes careless with cigarettes and campfires.
Lightning is another cause of forest fires. When the forest is very dry and lightning strikes it, a fire can start.

53,566,"April 22 is Earth Day. That is a day for people to take action and help Earth. This year, Earth Day is 40 years old. To celebrate, 40 events will take place in cities around the world. The events were the idea of Earth Day Network. That group is trying to get more people to take care of Earth.
The main event is going to be held in Washington, D.C. People can go there to learn more about ways to help Earth, says Sean Miller. He is the education director at Earth Day Network.

54,205,"invented in 1906 by Frank Henry Fleer
invented in 1948 by George de Mestral
People have been inventing things for years. Paper was invented about 2,000 years ago. The wheel was invented more than 5,000 years ago. What would life be like without paper to write on or bikes to ride? Those inventions have made life easier.
The Wright brothers invented the first airplane in December 1903. That makes 2003 the 100th anniversary! Before the airplane was invented, most people traveled by cars, boats, and trains. Today, airplanes help people travel faster. How do airplanes help you?
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. Before the telephone was invented, people kept in touch by writing letters or talking in person. Today, the telephone makes it easier for people to talk to one another. How do telephones help you?
The first four-wheeled gas-powered car was invented by Karl Benz in 1891. Before people had cars, they couldn't travel easily. They walked or rode horses for short trips. They took trains or boats for long trips. Today, cars are one of the main ways people travel. How do cars help you?
What are some other inventions that have changed our world?
People worked for years to make the first computer. It was built in 1946. The first computer was called ENIAC. Today, computers are an important part of many people's lives. People use computers as tools to write, get information, and much more. How do computers help you?

55,340,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.

62,563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.
Recently, Hubble took a photo of the Cone Nebula. A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nearby hot stars cause the Cone Nebula to glow red.

65,610,"We live in a jam-packed world. In fact, more people live here than ever before. The population recently hit a whopping 6.5 billion! The big news was reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.

to Mars in the next few weeks. A rover is a robotic spacecraft. It is expected to land on the planet next August.
. It will help find out whether life was once possible on Mars.
cameras will give researchers close-up views of the planet. They can show details smaller than the width of a human hair. The spacecraft also has a 7-foot-long robotic arm. It holds tools, such as a drill and a scoop. The tools will collect rocks and soil.
Researchers will study the materials to learn more about Mars, scientist Joy Crisp told

69,101,"Hello! My name is Jasmine Padilla. I'm 8 years old and in the third grade. I live in a town called Tusayan. It is a town next to Grand Canyon National Park. My family has lived here a long time. I go to Grand Canyon School.
The Grand Canyon has very tall cliffs for walls, and it is so wide that the trees on the other side look like trees for ants! The rocks are shades of pink and brown.
My favorite time of year in the Grand Canyon is winter. I like the winter because we play in the snow and can make a snowman. I also like to play with my friends and hike. I have seen rabbits, deer, and elk. Sometimes I can hear coyotes howling.

72,602,"A new study says chimps want to help.
Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return.
In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test.
The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of
in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful.
So the saying ""Kindness is its own reward"" may not be true just for humans.
Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos.
The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa.
uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa.
The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia.
is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa.
What does the expression ""Kindness is its own reward"" mean?

The insects use the sun to make their way south. Their antennae track the suns location. That helps the butterflies stay on the right path.
Butterflies without antennae dont fly in the correct direction, Steven Reppert told
. He was the leader of the study. That was a real surprise to us.
The discovery may help monarchs. People are cutting down trees in their habitat in Mexico. We might be able to guide the butterflies to ... different areas, Reppert says.

74,143,"Scientists are teaching whooping cranes to fly south.
Dressed in a white costume, scientist Joe Duff pretends to be a whooping crane. He may look silly, but he has an important job to do. Duff is training a flock of whooping crane chicks in Wisconsin to think he is their mother. ""It's like becoming a bird yourself,"" he told
Joe Duff is the team leader of a group called Operation Migration. Members have been teaching ""whoopers"" to
to Florida since 2001. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called
. Each aircraft is flown by a pilot in a whooping crane costume. In six months, the birds will be ready to follow the aircraft and migrate to Florida for the winter.
The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out.
Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall.
""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves.""
In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida.
Joe Duff spends a lot of time pretending to be a whooping crane. If you could be any animal, what would you be? Why?

75,64,"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis knows how popular wristbands have become as a way of raising money. She thought,
Sydney Davis has had diabetes since she was 5 years old. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this illness. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no
. Insulin helps the body use the sugar in food for energy.
Sydney came up with the idea to put the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today"" on blue wristbands. She and her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, sold the wristbands in their New Jersey community. After only a month, they had sold 10,000!
Soon after, the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York began selling the wristbands on its Web site. The bands became an even bigger hit! ""We made over $100,000 already,"" Sydney told
. ""I didn't think we'd make this much money, so I'm very happy."" The money will pay for research to find a cure for diabetes.

76,744,"Write a letter to the next president!
What advice would you give to the next president of the United States? Hundreds of kids had a lot of ideas. They wrote letters of advice to George W. Bush and John Kerry.
The letter program is taking place at a library in Massachusetts. Kids who can't go to that library can write letters online.
The kids had many things to say. ""Please make world peace and stop world hunger,"" wrote Luke, 9, from Florida. Eight-year-old Megan from Georgia wrote, ""I hope you try your hardest to help our country.""
A selection of letters will be sent to each candidate. ""The kids want to be heard,"" said one library staff member.

77,99,"Aibo is a robot. It is a dog that can bark and wag its tail!
Imagine it is the year 2014. After dinner, your robot clears the table and loads the dishwasher. Another robot tells jokes to make you laugh.
Does that sound like a scene out of a movie? It's not! Scientists predict robots will be very common in homes across the country in the near future.
Many robots are already being sold today. Sony's QRIO and iRobot's Roomba are two of these robots. QRIO is a humanlike robot that can talk, walk, jump, and dance. Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner.

78,179,"Scientists fear that monarchs may become endangered.
Catching monarch butterflies is no easy task. ""You have to sneak up behind them and then slip your net on them,"" said 8-year-old Evan Shauer from Wisconsin.
Before freeing the butterflies, Evan had a job to do. He placed a tiny numbered sticker on each monarch. Those black-and-orange butterflies were among thousands that kids across the country tagged.
Monarch butterflies do something very unusual for an insect: They
, or travel to a new location when the season changes. Each fall, millions of monarchs from North America head south. Most fly more than 2,000 miles to forests in Mexico.
Volunteers in Mexico look for the monarchs wearing tags. The tags help scientists figure out which butterflies reached Mexico and how far they flew.
, or at risk of dying out. People are cutting down trees in Mexico where the butterflies spend the winter.
""Our goal is to save the monarch migration,"" said butterfly expert Chip Taylor. ""To do this, we have to learn as much as we can about how the number of monarchs changes from year to year."" Kids like Evan are helping scientists do just that!
Why might it be important to save monarchs from dying out?

79,328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

80,548,"Why are so many frog species disappearing?
Why did dozens of harlequin frog species start vanishing 20 years ago? Scientists studying the brightly colored frogs might have solved the mystery. The experts blame a skin
for causing the frogs to die off. A fungus is a form of plant life that can cause disease in animals.
Harlequin frogs are not the only creatures in danger of dying out because of the disease. ""This fungus is killing amphibians all over the world,"" scientist Cynthia Carey told
is an animal with a backbone that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians. They are
which means their body temperature depends on their environment.
Scientists are working to save the worlds amphibians. Many of these creatures have already become
or died out completely. Disease is not the only danger for amphibians. Their habitat is being destroyed as people cut down trees in the areas where the animals live. Hunting, pollution, and weather changes are also contributing to the problem.
Is there any good news for frogs and other amphibians? The new findings will lead to more research, says Carey. The research could help scientists save the remaining animals before the fungus spreads. ""Weve identified the disease and how it works,"" scientist Karen Lips told
""Now we can try to stop it.""
What might happen if amphibians become extinct?

82,509,"More and more kids are using their heads. A recent study found that 73 out of every 100 kids wore a helmet while riding a bike. The bad news is that most of the kids did not wear the helmet the right way.
A helmet protects your head and brain if you fall. To work, the helmet must fit and be worn correctly. The helmet should rest on your head and cover your forehead. Helmet straps should always be tight. If the helmet is too loose, it wont protect your head. In-line skaters and skateboard riders should listen up too! Helmets are not just for biking. Experts say that kids should wear helmets for other wheel sports as well. Be smart and put safety first!

84,264,"Why do some plants and animals die out?
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water.
The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city.
The gates would take about ten years to complete. If the plan is a success, Venice will be saved from being swallowed by the sea.

85,100,"Overfishing and melting ice spell trouble for penguins.
Life is good for penguins in Antarctica at the end of the movie
Real-life penguins, though, have little to celebrate.
Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming
or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins.
""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told
Her wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins.
Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called
Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat.
Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill.
Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns
such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""We can and must reduce gas emissions to keep penguins safe in the future,"" says Siegel.

86,635,"The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
One at a time, visitors take turns crawling into a wooden box at a new museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. The museum is the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. The box is like the one in which a slave hid in the 1840s so he could be shipped to freedom.
The museum teaches visitors about the Underground Railroad. It was not actually a real railroad. It was a secret system of routes used to help slaves in the South escape to freedom in the North.
Most runaway slaves traveled hundreds of miles. They hid during the day and fled at night. Along the way, they stopped at safe homes called
. People at the stations provided slaves with food, clothing, and a place to rest.
""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it weren't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" museum official Stephen DeVillez told

90,387,"A military dog missing in Afghanistan returns to her troops.
Sabi is one smart pup. The dog knows how to sniff for bombs and protect soldiers. Recently, the black Labrador learned another skill: how to live on her own in Afghanistan for more than a year.
Afghanistan is a country in the Middle East. U.S. troops are at war in Afghanistan. They are fighting people who supported the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
About 70,000 U.S. troops are currently fighting in the war in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama recently announced that hes sending 30,000
The United States is not the only country fighting. Soldiers from more than 40 other countries are involved in the war. Sabi is part of a
of soldiers from Australia. A unit is a group. The military dog helps troops by
, or finding, bombs with her nose.
In September 2008, Sabis unit was fighting in Afghanistan. During the battle, she became separated from the soldiers. For months, Sabis unit searched for her without any luck.
Finally, a U.S. soldier spotted Sabi in November 2009. With the soldiers help, Sabi was
with her Australian unit. To reunite is to bring back together.
The troops will probably never know what their furry friend was up to all that time on her own. Theyre just glad to have found her. Says Australian leader Kevin Rudd, Sabi is back home in one piece.
The dog probably wouldnt mind lending another helping handor pawif soldiers need it.
251,827 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
28.4 million; about half are kids younger than 15
mostly mountains and deserts; only about 12 percent of the land can be farmed
What are some other ways dogs might help troops serving overseas?

91,339,"A rover like this one is making its way across the surface of Mars in search of life.
Is there life on Mars? Was there once life on Mars? People have been trying to answer those questions for years. Since 1960, scientists have sent spacecraft to explore the Red Planet.
NASA* recently launched two rovers into space. Scientists chose the launch date carefully. In August, Mars and Earth were closer than at any time in the past 60,000 years.
The rovers are on a mission. They are looking for signs that water once existed on Mars. Scientists say that water is the key to life. If they find evidence of water, that could mean there was once life on Mars.
The rovers each have a parachute and an airbag to help them bounce to a safe landing. Once the rovers land, they will drill into rocks and take photos of them. Then, the rovers will send the photos back to Earth.
Distance from Earth on August 27, 2003:
Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in our solar system. Mars has mountains, valleys, and ice caps. It also has seasons.
Scientists are hoping the rovers will provide clues to the Red Planet's past. The mission may also give scientists clues to Earth's future. ""We think Mars used to be more like Earth,"" said one scientist. ""Now look at it: It's harsh and cold. We know Earth is changing; this might help us understand how it has changed, and will [change] in the future.""
The names of the rovers are Spirit and Opportunuty. They were named by 9 year old Sofi Collis of Arizona. She was the winner of a rover naming contest.

On January 20, a group of kids and their families in Palmetto, Florida, will be doing a service project. Their goal is to clean up an old cemetery to make it beautiful again. Thousands of other kids will also do special projects in their cities and towns. Those acts of kindness will honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968).

King devoted his life to making the United States a better place. He believed that Americans should work to improve the lives of others. ""Everybody can be great because everybody can serve,"" King said.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day was first observed as a national holiday in 1986. It is celebrated each year on the third Monday in January. By helping others on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, kids and adults honor his dream for a better country.

spacecraft showed ditches on Mars. Scientists believe the ditches could have been made by flowing water.
Scientists think the ditches were made when water seeped from underground. There is no water on the surface now. Scientists say it probably froze or turned to a mist. No one is sure when the ditches were created. They could be as old as a million years or as young as one week.

94,343,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Does your backpack ever feel as if it's filled with bricks? If so, you are not alone. Many kids tend to overload their backpacks.
A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad
(POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk.
Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert.
What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!

About 5,300 years ago, a man walked along a mountain path. He stopped to rest and set down his copper ax. The man died there. In time, his body froze in the mountain's ice and snow. Now, scientists are trying to solve the mysteries this frozen man left behind.
In 1991, two climbers discovered a frozen body in the tztal (OETS-tahl) Mountains in Italy. Italy is a country in Europe. Scientists learned that the body was of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago. The ice had preserved his body, making it a
or warmed, the body so they could study the man's remains.
Scientists have nicknamed the mummy tzi, after the mountains where he was found. They have studied tzi's hair, teeth, skin, and clothes. So far, scientists have learned that tzi was probably a shepherd. He was wearing a grass cape, goatskin leggings, a bearskin cap, and fur-lined shoes. A
or guess, is that tzi was leading his herd of animals over the mountains when he died.
When he is not being studied, tzi is kept in a special freezer in a museum in Italy. His body is kept frozen so it does not
or rot. tzi's remains are helping scientists learn how much the world has changed in 5,300 years.

101,316,"Koalas eat about a pound of eucalyptus leaves each day.
The koala is a picky eater. To choose what to eat, it just follows its nose.
The menu for koalas is always the sameleaves! They eat only the leaves of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhs) trees. Sound boring? Not to a koala! There are thousands of these trees in Australia. The only problem is that leaves from some trees can make koalas very sick.
How does a koala know which leaves to choose? Scientists recently discovered that koalas learn from experience. After eating leaves that make them sick, the animals use their sense of smell to remember to avoid that type of leaf.
Scientists were not surprised to learn that koalas
means ""to like better."" Large trees have more leaves and offer better shelter to koalas.
A mother koala sits in a eucalyptus tree and holds her joey.
A marsupial is an animal that has a pouch in which to carry its young.
It looks like a small pink jellybean.
After a joey is born, it crawls into its mother's pouch. The joey drinks only its mother's milk for the first six months.
However, no matter how large the tree, koalas will not eat from one that makes them sick. They would rather go hungry than eat leaves from these trees, say scientists.
A koala napping in a eucalyptus tree.
To a koala, a forest is a tricky mix of good and bad leaves. Scientist Ben Moore says, ""It's like having to choose between 1,000 restaurantsor trees, in the koala's casespread all over town, without a restaurant guide.""

102,552,"Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide!
Scientists arent quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea.
The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets.
The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

The Colima (koh-LEE-mah) Volcano in Mexico has roared to life again. The 12,500-foot volcano is also called the ""Volcano of Fire."" Over the past few months, its eruptions have been larger and more frequent. It has been shooting hot gas and ash high into the sky.
The Volcano of Fire is Mexico's most
volcano. It has erupted many times over the years. What scientists are most worried about is the next big eruption. The volcano has had huge eruptions about every hundred years. The last one took place in 1913.
Scientists have noticed a pattern in recent activity that is very much like the pattern before the 1913 eruption. ""Most scientists are expecting a large, explosive eruption in the next 10 years or so,"" volcano expert Jim Luhr told
The volcano is 20 miles north of the city of Colima. To make sure no one is in danger, officials created a safety zone around the volcano. People aren't allowed in that area.
Scientists use special equipment to track changes within the volcano. ""We're looking for clues of another large, explosive eruption,"" says Luhr. ""That way, we can be prepared.""

106,236,"A penny now costs more to make than the coin is worth.
Pennies are not small change to Sylvester Neal. The Washington man is on his way to collecting a million of them. ""Sometimes I walk with my head down looking for pennies"" Neal, 62, told
Will the penny collector have that chance much longer? The U.S. Mint reports that it costs more to
or make, a penny than a penny is worth. Is the penny worth it? Both sides of the debate put in their two cents.
Lawmaker Jim Kolbe from Arizona recently presented a plan to get rid of the penny. He told
that his plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel."" Here is why Kolbe and others say we should lose the penny:
Pennies cost more to make than theyre worth.
Pennies are hard to spend. Many places, such as vending machines and tollbooths, dont accept them.
Cashiers get annoyed when people pay with pennies.
Mark Weller leads the group Americans for Common Cents. Its members are working to save the penny. ""Americans want to keep the penny,"" he told
Heres why Weller and others support keeping the coin:
The penny is part of American history.
Rounding up sales will cost people more money.
Alyssa Mayorga is known as the ""Penny Princess."" The 11-year-old from California saves pennies to buy bulletproof vests for police dogs.
She recently raised money to buy vests for seven police dogs in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Each vest cost $400. ""I feel like Im helping the dogs when theyre on duty so they wont get hurt,"" Alyssa told
The penny was first minted in 1787. Benjamin Franklin suggested its original design.
President Abraham Lincoln first appeared on the penny in 1909. That year marked his 100th birthday.
A copper penny has very little copper in it. The penny is mostly zinc.
Should the penny stay or go? Discuss in class.

107,19,"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses
vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.)
The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message.

Today, about 1,200 seals live near the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Experts fear that the population will drop in the next five years. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer.
Experts worry that the seals are not getting enough food. Many of the pups are thin and are not living past their first few years. Scientists are trying to figure out why.
Other scientists are monitoring the monk seals habitat for pollution. A

109,581,"Orangutans have babies only once every eight years.
Orangutans (aw-RANG-oo-tanz) eat and sleep high in the treetops of rain forests. However, these great apes are not safe.
When she was 8 years old, Misha liked to jump up and down on her nest. She played with her food. Sometimes she needed her mothers help to cross from one tree to another.
Misha is one of thousands of orangutans that live in Asia. They are found on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra.
Scientists are worried about the survival of these red-haired apes. They are in danger of becoming
, or dying out. Scientists say orangutans could be extinct in the wild within ten years.
Why are orangutans in such danger? Their
is being destroyed. A habitat is the area where an animal makes its home.
People are the main threat to these apes. Some people cut down trees in the areas where orangutans live. The trees are sold as lumber. In addition, people steal baby orangutans from the forest and sell them as pets.
Do you think it is important to save orangutans? Why?
""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" scientist Cheryl Knott told

112,299,"Talk about lost and found! A team of scientists recently discovered some tiny critters in Indonesia. They are called pygmy tarsiers (PIG-mee TAWR-see-uhrss). Indonesia is a country in Asia.
Pygmy tarsier: Sharon Gursky-Doyen; Map: Leigh Haeger
Scientists thought this little creature was lost forever.
, or completely gone. Thats because no one had seen the animals alive for about 70 years.
. Primates are an animal group that includes humans, apes, and monkeys. The little fur ball is less than 4 inches long. It weighs about 2 ounces. It has wide eyes, big ears, and a long tail.
Scientists caught three pygmy tarsierstwo males and one female. They attached radio collars to their necks. Then they released the animals. When scientists return to Indonesia, they will track the collars to find and study the creatures.
Professor Sharon Gursky-Doyen helped find the critters. She told
, Its very exciting knowing that the animal does still exist.

113,367,"Maddie Siegel signs a copy of her new book.
When Maddie Siegel encountered bullies at school, she didnt get mad. She got writing! To encounter is to come across. The 10-year-old from Marietta, Georgia, recently wrote a book with her dad called
named Meredith. A character is a person in a story.
When Meredith starts school in a new town, she is teased by bullies on the school bus. As Meredith makes friends, she learns how to stick up for herself.
The book is based on Maddies own experiences. If youre having problems with [bullies], you need to stand up for yourself and let adults know, she told

114,141,"Scientists in Canada are playing Go Fish. They recently counted sharks that swim in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada.
Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to
or watch, the sharks in the coming months.
Scientist Steve Campana took part in the shark count. He says not all sharks are safe like those near Canada. ""Worldwide, sharks are in trouble,"" he told

115,267,"There will soon be a place in Washington, D.C., fit for a King. U.S. officials recently gave the OK for construction to begin on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial (right). The statue will be built on the National Mall.
King (19291968) was born in Georgia. At that time, people in the southern United States were separated by race. Under the law, black people could not attend the same schools as white people. They also had to use separate public restrooms.
King worked to change the rules in the South. He led peaceful marches and gave speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. Thanks to King and some other leaders, Congress passed
. Those laws make sure that all Americans have equal rights.
Martin Luther King Jr. gives an important speech in Washington, D.C., in 1963.
Officials hope to complete the King memorial in 2011. Christine King Farris is Kings sister. She says the memorial is important because it will remind people of the good work her brother did.

116,239,"You were fine a moment ago. Now you're tired and achy. The school nurse takes your temperature. You have a fever. Bad news-those are all symptoms of the flu, or
Hang in there; you are not alone. This flu season started early, and the virus spread quickly. The good news is that flu season appears to have slowed down.
Some health experts say this flu season was most harmful to kids. Doctors' offices and hospitals have been flooded with sick kids.
Schools in several states have closed for ""sick days"" because so many kids had the flu. To keep the virus from spreading, many teachers have asked students to wash their hands often. School officials want to make sure healthy students don't get sick.
Along with washing your hands, what else can you do to stay healthy?
The best way to stay flu-free is to get a flu
(vak-SEEN), or shot, say experts. ""If you get the flu, don't panic. Most kids will recover just fine,"" Dr. Carol Baker of Houston, Texas, told
. ""Taking medicine to lower the fever and drinking lots of liquids will help. Plenty of rest will also help fight the nasty flu virus.""

120,300,"If two heads are better than one, a newly discovered turtle is head and shoulders above other turtles. May Toro found a two-headed turtle in Florida. ""I was shocked. I couldn't believe it,"" Toro said after she picked up the turtle.
Toro works for Mary Kraus, who studies turtles. Kraus says she has seen the eggs of two headed turtles before. However, she has never seen a living two-headed turtle. ""This is the first time I've ever seen one alive, fully developed, and hatched,"" Kraus said.
The two-headed turtle is a loggerhead turtle. The U.S. government says the loggerhead turtle is an endangered species. Loggerhead turtles can grow to be 3 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds!
After studying the turtle for a couple of days, Toto and Kraus let the turtle go. ""We didn't want it to become a freak in a freak show"", Kraus said.

121,340,"Astronomers have decided that eight is the magic number when it comes to our solar system. The eight planets now include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto belongs in a new class referred to as dwarf planets. The decision was made to create the new category because powerful telescopes have let scientists find more and more Pluto-like objects in space.
Jupiter is the largest planet. It is 88,846 miles wide.
Mercury has the fastest orbit around the sun. It moves almost 30 miles a second.
Venus is the hottest planet. Its average surface temperature is 867 degrees.
the largest asteroid, was discovered in 1801. Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun. Most lie in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
the frozen dwarf, is located 4 billion miles from the sun. Charon, Plutos largest moon, was found in 1978.
2003 UB313 is a large object discovered in 2003. Nicknamed ""Xena,"" it is larger than Pluto and orbits in the Kuiper belt, an outer area of our solar system.
OK, now that Pluto is gone from the planet lineup, what memory trick will school kids use to remember the names and order of the eight planets? Heres one mnemonic device: My Very Excellent Mother Just Sent Us Nachos. Now its your turn. E-mail your ideas to ed4@weeklyreader.com and well post some entries online.

122,735,"Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face
When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal.
""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told
. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down.""
Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of
. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told
Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territorycyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work.
Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class.
For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab.
Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being
, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face.
Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online.""
To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others.
TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most.""
, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution.""
Online safety experts offer the following tips to protect yourself from cyberbullying:
Don't give out your passwords or any private information to anyone, even close friends.
Don't post any information online that you don't want others to read.
Don't answer a mean or threatening e-mail, block the person who sent you the offensive message, and tell a trusted adult. That person can help you take action.
Don't react to a mean message. Walk away from the computer and do something else that you enjoy for a few minutes.
Run your name through search engines, such as Google, to check whether there is information that you don't want on the Internet. Some search engines let you set up alerts that send you an e-mail if a new posting includes your name.
How is face-to-face communication similar to or different from sending a message by e-mail or IM?

123,150,"Thanks to Harry Potter, kids everywhere are enchanted with magical worlds.
Muggles, beware! Harry, Ron, and Hermione have cast a spell on kids everywhere, including fifth grader Jake Lisakolsky from Naugatuck, Connecticut.
Jake and millions of other Potter fans lined up this summer for
. That is the sixth title in the seven-book series. More than 100 million Potter books are in print in the United States alone. ""The Harry Potter series is a thrilling tale,"" Jake told
. ""And Book 6 is one of the best!""
But it's not just Harry and his friends who are enchanting children around the globe. Kids are devouring other fantasy books too. Fantasy lovers are escaping into the imaginary worlds of
(ZHAN-rah), or type, of book or movie that is set in a world completely different from our own. Fantasy is nothing new, although it has become all the rage again, thanks to author J. K. Rowling's brave boy wizard.
""Hats off to Rowling,"" English professor Alida Allison of San Diego State University told
. ""She probably didn't expect this, but she started a [new] wave of fantasy reading.""
for the second timeand he is almost halfway through J.R.R. Tolkien's
. A trilogy is a series of three related books or movies that tell a story. What's the draw of fantasy? ""Fantasy is full of action and excitement,"" says Jake.
It's not surprising that fantasy has turned millions of kids into book-worms. ""Fantasy allows children to think about other worlds and contrast them to their own,"" says Allison. ""It stretches their imaginations.""
What exactly makes a story a fantasy? Traditionally, a fantasy tells the story of a single character, the hero, such as Harry Potter. Like Harry, the hero is often unaware of his or her power. After crossing into a different world, the hero is faced with a series of tests.
In a fantasy story, a teacher often shows the hero the tricks of the trade. In
, wise Gandalf protects the hobbit Frodo. Harry, too, is taught by Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.
Fantasy books typically end with a battle between the hero and the villainand the hero ultimately wins. If Rowling sticks to the fantasy formula, will Harry defeat Lord Voldemort in Book 7 of the series?
The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen, with many books being made into films. Fans of
movies turned out in record numbers. This December, a film version of the classic C. S. Lewis book
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
will hit theaters. It tells the story of four children who enter Narnia, a world filled with strange creatures.
On November 18, the fourth Harry Potter film
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
hopes to work its magic on fantasy fans again. Jake can't wait to see it and compare it with the book. He is especially looking forward to the Quidditch World Cup scene. He says the filmmakers had ""better not mess it up!""
caught up with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) on the set of
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
. Daniel, now 15, plays the boy wizard on screen.
: How would you describe Harry these days?
Daniel: He's grown up quite a bit. In this story, everything is being taken away, and it's out of his hands. Harry struggles to get a grip on the situation.
: Are you shy, as Harry is with Cho Chang [his Goblet of Fire crush], in real life?
Daniel: I'm quite shy, but I'd like to think that I'm not. Sometimes I find myself not knowing what to say to [girls].
: Which scenes did you most enjoy filming?
Daniel: The underwater scenes were the most interesting and the most fun. Mike [Newell, the director] told us, ""Don't try to actually speak your lines underwater. Just move your mouth.""
: If you could have any magical power of Harry's, what would it be?
Daniel: [I would want to do] everything with the wand, like cast spells.
Is it better to read the book first or see the movie? Explain your answer.

124,96,"Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith was recently honored at the United Nations in New York City for her courage during last years tsunami. Two weeks before the December 26, 2004, disaster, she had studied tsunamis in her geography class at her school just outside London, England. Her teacher showed the class a video of a tsunami. Tilly paid very close attention.
When her family was vacationing on a beach in Phuket, Thailand, Tilly immediately recognized the warning signs of a tsunami. Her quick thinking saved the lives of about 100 people in the area.
""I saw this bubbling on the water, right on the edge, and foam sizzling just like in a frying pan,"" Tilly says. ""The water was coming in, but it wasnt going out again.""
Tilly knew the waves would pound the shore within minutes. With the help of a security guard and a chef, Tilly spread the warning. People
or fled, the beach just minutes before the tsunamis devastating waves struck.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton praised Tillys smart and courageous act. At the U.N. ceremony, President Clinton said, ""Tillys story is a simple reminder that education can make a difference between life and death.""

125,72,"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago.
The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake
, which means ""place of the long boats.""
The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes.
The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks.

126,628,"Drinks like soda have caffeine and lots of sugar.
Soft-drink companies are in fizzy competition. Many people in the United States are overweight. In the face of the nation's growing health and nutrition problems, many schools have banned soft drinks and other high-sugar snacks from vending machines.
As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools.
Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word
in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them.
is a mineral found in milk and other dairy products that helps build strong teeth and bones.
Soft-drink giants aren't the only beverage companies trying to find their place in school districts. As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks.
Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert.
Why is it important to read food labels carefully?
Other nutritionists disagree. They say the new juices and milk products are an improvement over previously available choices.

127,212,"Sometimes its OK to play with your food. People created hundreds of sculptures from food cans and entered them in a yearly competition called Canstruction. The contest is held in dozens of cities across North America to help collect food for people who are
For their projects, teams can create anything they want as long as they do it with cans, bottles, and bags of food. Wire, string, and rubber bands are also allowed. Glue is forbidden.
Past sculptures that have made it into the winners circle include a hot dog, a castle, and sea creatures, such as an octopus and a shark. The number of cans used to build those structures ranged from 1,000 to 13,000.
Elementary school students in Tampa, Florida, recently built spooky sculptures with everything from cans of black beans to boxes of spaghetti. Eleven-yearold Ashley Weaver, who helped construct a haunted house, thought her project looked ""cool.""
Canstruction prizes are awarded to the sculpture with the most cans, the most creative sculpture, the best use of can labels, and the ""best meal""the tastiest combination of food.
Canstruction is about more than creativity, though. All the food used to make the sculptures is donated to shelters and food banks. To view the artwork, visitors have to bring canned goods as their admission fee. That food is also donated. Some food banks have helped feed evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. Last years contests raised more than 1 million pounds of canned goods.
""[Canstruction] is an opportunity to bring in much-needed food,"" says Burma Rai, the executive director of an Ohio food bank. Rais food bank recently received donations from a Canstruction event held in Dayton, Ohio.
The students in Florida understand the importance of helping people who need food. ""Youre helping someone get a can of food,"" Alexis Carrasco, 10, told reporters as she and her classmates worked on their sculpture. ""This is fun for us and helpful to them.""
To find out when a Canstruction event is coming to a city near you,
Although the United States is the richest country in the world, more than 37 million Americans live in poverty. That is more than the population of California, the most populous state. Many of those impoverished Americans are kids. About one in four American children is born poor. What else can be done to fight the poverty problem?

In 1977, Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement.
Judges award the Nobel Peace Prize to a person or a group working for peace. Nobel Prizes are also given for achievements in science, medicine, and literature. Those prizes are presented on December 10 as well, but in Stockholm, Sweden.
Maathai has dedicated her life to helping the environment. In 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement. This organization has helped plant more than 30 million trees across Africa, which has suffered from the loss of forests.
The judges awarded Maathai the prize for growing more than trees. They said she has planted the seeds of peace by making sure that people have natural resources so they don't fight over them.
This year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient joins a group of well-known winners. Have you heard of any of them?

133,488,"Our sun is a seething ball of hot gases. The sun is always active, but for the rest of this year, the sun will be more active than usual, scientists say.
Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the
, which are shifting curtains of colored light.
When the sun is very active, dark spots, called
, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface.
Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows.
When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called
, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere.
When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites.
The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth.
A car traveling at 55 miles per hour would take 193 years to get from Earth to the sun.
It takes a beam of light eight minutes to travel from the surface of the sun to Earth.
When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights.
The northern lights can be many different colors: red, blue, green, or a combination of colors.
Scientists say the best time to see the northern lights is when the sun is active. People in many parts of the United States should be able to see the northern lights in the night sky this fall. People who live in the northern part of the United States have the best chance of seeing the dancing lights. To see them, the sky must be very dark.
senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful.""

134,246,"Explorer Brge Ousland likes challenges. He currently holds four polar records. He set his last record in 1997 when he became the first person to walk across Antarctica without help.
Now Ousland is taking on a new challenge. At the end of February, he was scheduled to begin a 1,100-mile Arctic trek from Siberia to Canada via the North Pole. Siberia is a region of eastern Russia.
If successful, Ousland will be the first person to cross the top of the world alone and without help. Although he was not sure how long the trip would take, the explorer planned to pull a 340-pound sled with food and supplies for 90 days.

Toucans and other creatures hold on as their rain forest home dissappers.
fly among the forest. Emerald tree boas curl up on branches to stalk prey. Endangered jaguars slink through the thick brush in search of food. These are just a few of the thousands of animals that call the Amazon rain forest home.
A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world.
Yet the Amazons future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape.
has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate.
Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forests
or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush.
Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered.
Deforestation affects people too. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines we need come from the rain forest.
The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a
Greenhouse gases trap the suns heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earths climate would become much hotter.
Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazils government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governments efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland.
Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told
""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive.""
Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""

136,98,"Scientists are testing Columbus's bones to settle a dispute over where he is buried.
Christopher Columbus may be going on one more journey. Scientists have opened a tomb in Spain that they believe contains his bones. The bones are traveling to a laboratory in Spain for testing.
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer.
In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips.
When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.

137,45,"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values contest. The U.S. Army and the Pentagon sponsored the contest. Nearly 14,000 kids in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest.
The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army.
David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values.""
David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery.

140,686,"The cheetah cubs born recently at the National Zoo will reach their top speed of 70 miles per hour when they are about a year old.
It was a big day at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. First the mother cheetah came out of her cage. Then came one, two, three, four, five cubs. The babiesborn this summerleaped and played around their mother. The cubs, then just 10 weeks old, weighed only 9 pounds and were about the size of house cats.
The litter was the second born at the zoo in seven monthsand in its 116-year history. Cheetahs are extinct in the wild except in Africa, where only between 8,000 and 10,000 remain.
""They're pretty quick,"" Lauren Afdahl, an animal keeper at the National Zoo, told
. ""Whenever they see something moving, they take off and run."" The cubs will reach their top speed of 70 miles per hour when they are about a year old. That is as fast as a car speeding on the highway.
The cubs will stay with their mother for at least a year. When they are fully grown and weigh about 100 pounds, they may be sent to other zoos.

141,339,"Some experts question rewarding reading with pizza.
Everyone loves pizza, but should it be used as a reward for reading?
Should kids be reading for pizza? A nationwide reading program is drawing criticism for putting pizza front and center. Since 1985, the restaurant chain Pizza Hut has been running the Book It program, which rewards students for reading with personal pan pizzas. Now some people are taking a slice at Book It. They say the program promotes poor eating habits and gives Pizza Hut free advertising in public schools.
""It's clear that Pizza Hut's Book It has no place in public schools. ... It promotes junk food,"" says Susan Linn, a cofounder of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The group has called for schools to stop participating in the Book It program.
Nearly 22 million children in 50,000 U.S. schools take part in Book It. Since the program began, more than 200 million pizzas have been given away. Each year, from October 1 through March 31, students read books to meet monthly reading goals set by teachers. When students meet their goal for the month, they get a certificate for a personal pan pizza.
""We're really proud of the program,"" says Leslie Tubbs, the director of Book It. ""We get hundreds of e-mails from [past participants] who praise it and say it helped them get started with reading."" In 1988, President Ronald Reagan honored the program for promoting
But critics say schools can teach students to enjoy reading without the help of a fast-food company. ""Schools need to realize that they are undermining their students' well-being,"" says nutrition expert Jane Levine. She explains that the Book It program is a problem not just because it rewards kids with fast food but also because it makes a large company a regular part of the school day.

143,182,"Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools?
If you're like most schoolkids, you've recited the Pledge of Allegiance more times than you can remember. But now students in three public school districts in California are no longer allowed to say those historic words.
A federal judge in California ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance is
because it contains the phrase ""under God."" If something does not uphold the rules of the U.S. Constitution, it is considered unconstitutional.
For years, Michael Newdow of California has fought to have the phrase removed from the pledge. He continually argues that because of the pledge's reference to God, his elementary school daughter should not have to listen to it recited daily.
Last year, the case did not make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the recent lower court's ruling, it is unclear whether the Supreme Court will now hear the controversial case.
Should the Pledge of Allegiance be banned from public schools because of the phrase ""under God""? Discuss in class. Then cast your vote at
According to the federal court, the phrase ""under God"" suggests that the government supports religion. That violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to part of this amendment as the separation of church and state.
Newdow provides the reverse argument for removing the reference to God from the pledge. He says, ""Imagine you send your kids to school every day, and the teachers [make] them stand up and say, ""We are one nation that denies God exists.""
The pledge represents a way for many Americans to express their
, or loyalty to the country. ""Our school board has long supported [the pledge] as an appropriate patriotic exercise for willing students,"" says Steven Ladd, the superintendent from one of the California school districts affected by the ruling.
Others point out that the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem contain religious references. Critics of the ruling argue that saying the pledge is
. Kids don't have to say the pledge if they don't want to participate.

144,291,"Crews restart construction on the space station.
Mission completed! On September 21, astronauts returned to Earth aboard the space shuttle
The six-person crew had come back from a successful journey to the
about 220 miles above Earth. The astronauts added new solar panels to the giant space lab. The solar panels will power the station, which
or travels around, Earth. It was the first major delivery to the space station since 2002.
Once completed, the space station will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. It will measure 361 feet end to end.
The space station is being built as a joint effort by 16 countries, including the United States. Construction began in 1998, and the first crew arrived in 2000. The diagram shows when parts of the space station were added.

145,747,"Students are spending more time studying at home, but is that a good thing?
Homework is on the rise! Nine- to 12-year-olds are spending 20 percent more time studying at home than they spent in 1997, according to a recent study from the University of Maryland. ""Kids spend an average of 50 minutes to 75 minutes studying every day,"" says the studys author, Sandra L. Hofferth.
But is taking schoolwork home a good thing? Two recent books have education experts asking, is homework helpful?
writers Nancy Kalish and Sara Bennett write that homework keeps kids from participating in school sports and other after-school programs. ""Its the youngest kids who seem to be getting the most homework,"" Bennett told
""and theyre the least ready to do it.""
that ""no scientific studies have shown that kids
from homework in any way before high school."" (
means ""to receive help."") Kohn thinks that too much homework can take the fun out of learning.
Many education officials say homework is good for learning. ""Its important [for kids] to get used to doing homework,"" Harris Cooper of Duke University told
Cooper is one of the countrys leading researchers on homework. He says practicing homework now will help kids in high school. Cooper suggests that students should expect to do 40 minutes of homework each day.
Many teachers see the value of homework as well. ""I think homework is helpful to most kids. It gives them more responsibility,"" fourth-grade teacher Pepper Schrock of Orlando, Florida, told
""I try to give meaningful projects as homework.""

146,669,"One morning in February, 75,000 kids woke up to find that they had become U.S. citizens. The kids, who were all adopted from other countries, became citizens because of the Child Citizenship Act.
The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

150,752,"The National Museum of the American Indian opened on September 21, 2004.
Drumbeats echoed. Songs and cheers filled the air. Spirits soared. More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.
They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.
""[The new museum] is a living tribute to the first Americans,"" museum director W. Richard West Jr. told the crowd. West is a member of the Southern Cheyenne tribe.
Native Americans from Alaska to South America
, or came together, for the museum's opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling.
The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.
Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""

152,646,"Recently, Judy Leden strapped a pair of wings on her back. Then she ran as fast as she could down a hill. As she ran, the wings slowly lifted Leden off the ground. Soon she was soaring through the sky.
The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A glider based on drawings made by Leonardo da Vinci recently flew.
Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance.
A glider does not have an engine.
Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds.
No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

154,111,"Tsunemi Kubodera stands before a giant squid on Display at National Science Museum in Tokyo.
A team of Japanese scientists snapped the first photographs of one of the deep sea's most mysterious creaturesa giant squid. It was the first time a giant squid was photographed in the wild! The researchers took more than 500 pictures of the sea creature off the coast of the Bonin Islands in Japan.
How did scientists nab pictures of the 26-foot-long sea monster? They tracked down the squid by following the only creatures that feed on itsperm whales. Once they determined where the whales dined, the scientists attached a robotic camera to a fishing line with bait. Then they took pictures of the purplish-red squid attacking its prey nearly 3,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The squid became caught on the camera but eventually swam away after one of its tentacles broke off.

155,541,"Steve Cantees is a high school principal. He always worries about his students' grades and behavior. This year, he is also concerned about their school clothes.
His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees.
Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans.
For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds.
Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.
Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist.""
Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

156,228,"History is getting ready to repeat itself. This summer, the Olympic Games will return to their birthplace--Greece.
This year's Summer Olympics will take place from August 13 through August 29 in Athens, the capital of Greece. The Summer Games are held every four years.
""This Olympic homecoming will be an opportunity to reawaken the true spirit and meaning of the Olympic Games,"" said an Athens organizing committee member.
The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens.
The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves.
Over the years, more events were added, such as wrestling, discus throwing, and chariot racing.
As times changed, the Olympics evolved. In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games began in Athens. At that time, 312 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports.
Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis.
Since 1896, the Olympic Games have journeyed around the world and have been
by, or held in, many cities. In keeping with tradition, the Olympic torch was
, or lit, this March in an ancient stadium in Olympia.
, or worldwide, Olympic Torch Relay. It is the first time in history that the Olympic torch will journey through all continents except Antarctica. The torch will travel nearly 48,000 miles before reaching the opening ceremonies in Athens.
As runners carry the torch around the world, people in Athens are having a race of their own. They are busy preparing for the estimated 5.3 million
, or viewers, who are expected to flood the city in August.
Construction workers are feverishly working to finish building the
. Those are the places where Olympic athletes will compete in different events.
At press time, the roof still had to be put on the Olympic Stadium. That is the site where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held. It is also where track-and-field events will take place.
Around the rest of the city, workers are completing a railway system and tearing up narrow roads to widen them for traffic. Hotels and restaurants are getting ready for an influx of tourists. Topping the Olympic planners' list is making sure the city is secure for athletes and visitors.
Some people are concerned that Athens might not be ready for the Olympics. But the Greek government was quick to reassure: ""We will have everything ready when it matters. We will offer what the world expects of us.""

157,25,"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny.
The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an
. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news.
Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election.
The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing.
to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols.
A forecaster is someone who predicts the weather. Why does the artist depict Bush and Kerry as weather forecasters?
What point is the cartoonist making about the candidates and the economy?
How do the symbols help convey the message? What do the suns represent? What do the hail and thunderstorm clouds represent?
Do you think the cartoonist prefers one candidate over the other? Why or why not?
What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and
between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party.
To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons...""
Why might the Bush and Kerry campaigns be ordering mud?
What message do you think the cartoonist is sending about the election campaign?
When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue.
Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the
Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told
What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!""
If you think you'd like to be an editorial cartoonist, Markstein has some tips:
Draw well and write well. (Yes, there is writing in most cartoons!)
Read the newspaper to learn what is going on in the world.
Be creative, use your imagination, and have a good sense of humor!

158,118,"Nine-year-old Hannah Niles loves poetry! The fourth grader especially enjoys reading poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. ""He uses a lot of expression and detail in his poems,"" she told
Hannah belongs to the Basketball Poets. That is a group of 40 fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in Supply, North Carolina. The students meet once a week in the gym, where they read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball.
Poetry lets kids express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said 10-year-old Douglas Mitchell.
The Basketball Poets also had the opportunity to meet two published poetsKenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's authors visited the school and gave the students advice on writing poetry. ""They were professional, and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said Hannah.
Who came up with the idea for the Basketball Poets? It was the school's physical education teacher, Marty Mentzer. She sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""It's cool to be a reader and a writer,"" she said, ""and basketball teaches them teamwork.""

159,123,"Students from Camden's Promise Charter School in New Jersey recently finished both a canned-food drive and a clothing drive. And they are currently helping a local literacy agency reach its goal of collecting 20,000 books.
Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3).
This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers.
""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!""
""Volunteers learn important skills like teamwork and responsibility,"" said Melissa Helmbrecht, founder of the volunteer organization Champions of Hope.
Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters.
Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day,
star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told
, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others.""
Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him.
Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have.""
""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book,
!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference.
Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in
. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences.
The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place.
In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering.
Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person.""

160,696,"History in the Making: Three Days of Peace and Music
Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

The theme of this year's Earth Day is ""Water for Life."" More than 1 billion people around the world do not have clean drinking water. Many children and their families will test the quality of their local water resources on Earth Day.
found underground. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
The burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air and water. Many scientists think that contributes to the overheating of the Earth.
The Earth Day Network wants people to rely more on clean sources of energy that don't pollute the environment. Some of those sources include sun, wind, and hydrogen power. For example, scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered cars that do not release harmful exhausts into the air the way today's gasoline-powered cars do.

163,510,"There are cameras almost everywhere. They watch us in banks and in stores and when we're riding in cars. They watch us at concerts and at sporting events. On reality TV, video cameras follow celebrities and ordinary people as they go about their lives. Now cameras are even popping up in public schools.
Students in Biloxi, Mississippi, have found themselves under the watchful eye of Web cameras. Their school district is one of the first in the country to have cameras located in all public-school classrooms.
The school superintendent says that the use of cameras helps make sure students behave and prevents crime. The cameras, which don't record sound, are not open to public viewing.
Only the superintendent and school officials, such as principals, can watch.
Before watching the class on computers, officials are required to enter a password. Parents, teachers, and students would need court permission to watch.
Many teachers and students say they feel safer with cameras and are pleased to have them in the classrooms. Others say they don't feel the same way. They are concerned that Web cameras may interfere with teaching and distract students from learning. They also point out that the use of cameras is an invasion of privacy.
the cameras have been placed in classrooms for safety purposes. The cameras are meant for ""supervision, not snoopervision,"" he said.

or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months.
Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration.
Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2.
The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold.
No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure.""

165,788,"Jonas Salk invented the vaccine that has almost wiped out polio.
Entire communities used to shut down each summer between 1930 and the early 1950s as families kept their kids indoors. Parents feared their children would be exposed to a disease called
. The disease crippled many people and sometimes caused death.
Thanks to Jonas Salk, polio has been almost wiped out worldwide. Salk was a doctor who invented a
to prevent the disease. Vaccines are shots or medications that protect people from getting certain diseases.
Salk's vaccine was officially declared safe on April 12, 1955. In honor of the 50th anniversary of that event, a new exhibit will open on April 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The exhibit is called ""Whatever Happened to Polio?""
disease. That means it can be passed easily from person to person. Polio can strike at any age but mainly affects kids.
The disease spreads when a virus attacks the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain that control muscles in the arms, legs, and stomach. It can
people, causing them to lose movement in different parts of their body.
The museum's exhibit will look at the history of polio and the development of the vaccine. Included among the objects to be displayed are the leg braces worn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease.
""The introduction of a successful polio vaccine in 1955 was one of the most significant events of the 20th century,"" said museum director Brent Glass.
Although polio has disappeared from much of the world, it still threatens children in Africa and Southeast Asia. The new exhibit will focus on current efforts to
, or give vaccines to, children in those places.
One of the most famous victims of polio was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted polio and was confined to a wheelchair, although he was able to stand and take a few steps while wearing leg braces. The president declared a war on the disease.

166,658,"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years.
The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the
, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year.
On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort.
The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old!
When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers.""
The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty.
Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point.
Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate.
George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives.

168,679,"This will be a very different school year for Rand Amir. The fifth grader is among millions of schoolchildren who went back to school in Iraq in early October.
On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""
A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq.
that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said.
The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told
that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

170,701,"Imagine ordering an ice cream cone and knowing that it's improving your health. That might be possible in the future. Scientists are experimenting with ways to add extra nutrients to ice cream. Nutrients are the parts of food that the body uses for growth and energy.
One type of nutrient that scientists want to add to ice cream is the group of fatty acids called omega-3. They are found in fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for circulation and help prevent heart disease.
The challenge for scientists is developing a final product that tastes more like ice cream and less like fish. ""It's easier to get people to eat what they're used to than to get them to change their eating pattern,"" said food scientist Bob Roberts.
Roberts wants to provide people with more types of foods from which they can get their omega-3s. Ice cream may just be one fun way to do that!

171,235,"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked.
Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed.
""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate.""
Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old
, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times.
Along with many valuable objects, the vase was stolen from the museum after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April.
At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or
, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues.
One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind.""
. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization.
Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad.
Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned.
Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy.
The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing.""
Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek,
means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there.
Here are some of the Iraqi National Museum's valuable artifacts and their status at the time
This 5,000-year-old stone statue of a woman praying was still missing.
This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting.
How did looters steal from world history when they ransacked the museum?
Originally thought to be missing, this tablet is a record of the world's earliest writing. It was found on the museum's second floor, away from the riots.

Researchers say the rising whale population is causing the collisions. Today, an estimated 10,000 humpbacks roam the Pacific Ocean. That's good news for the endangered humpbacks. However, boaters will have to slow down to avoid hurting the many humpback whales.
or jumping out of the water. Scientists think breaching is how whales play or show off to attract a mate.

Humpback whales eat from 2,000 to 9,000 pounds of fish and krill (small, shrimplike creatures) each day.
Scientists have identified 622 ""words,"" or repeated sounds, in the squeaking noises made by humpback whales. Scientists call the sounds ""songs,"" because many of them rhyme! On a separate sheet of paper, write what you imagine those whale songs might be about.

173,718,"New evidence suggests the famous ship sank faster than previously thought.
A new discovery has surfaced surrounding the worlds most famous shipwreck. The Titanics plunge to the ocean floor might have been faster than previously thought, say researchers.
Scientists once believed that the luxury liner broke into two main piecesthe
The bow is the front of the ship, and the stern is the back of the ship. The sinking was depicted that way in the 1997 movie
The discovery of more wreckage suggests that the

On April 14, 1912, the luxury liner struck an iceberg on its very first voyage and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Before the ship departed from Southampton, England, on its way to New York, it was hailed as ""unsinkable."" On that fateful April night, more than 1,500 people sank to their watery graves 2 miles below the oceans surface.
In 1985, explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the wreck in two pieces. The wreck was found about 1,000 miles east of Boston, Massachusetts.
were found about a third of a mile from the wreck. The hull is the main part of the ship.
Undersea explorers say these pieces make up the bottom section that was missing when the ship was discovered nearly 21 years ago. It wasnt until after the bottom section of the hull broke off that the bow and the stern split.
expert David Brown estimated it took 20 minutes for the ship to sink. Now he says it likely plunged to the bottom of the ocean within five minutes. ""It was over more quickly,"" says Brown.

174,737,"If you have any doubt that reading can help save lives, you haven't read about an amazing fourth grader, Brandon Lecher. On October 3, he saved a classmate from choking to death. And he did this because he had read a story in
Last year in school, Brandon read an article in
about a student who had helped his school's principal.
The student had seen the principal choking during lunch and had used the
to clear the principal's throat. The Heimlich maneuver is a quick and easy way to clear the throat of a person who is choking.
At the time he read the story, Brandon didn't think he would ever need to use the Heimlich maneuver. But what he learned from the article later helped him save a life.
During lunch on October 3, Brandon looked up and saw a classmate, Joseph Dettwiler, choking and frantically pointing to his throat.
""I saw Joseph choking on a potato chip,"" Brandon recently told
. ""His face was turning red and blue, and he was holding his throat.""
Then Brandon remembered reading about the Heimlich maneuver in
. ""It just came to my mind. When my class read about it, it sounded like an interesting subject, so I paid attention,"" Brandon said. ""That's when I did the Heimlich maneuver. I was scared, but I remembered what to do.""
Joseph doesn't remember much about the experience except being frightened and seeing Brandon jump out of his seat. ""I was really scared,"" Joseph said, but ""Brandon got up and saved my life.""
What did Joseph learn from the experience? ""I learned that you should chew your food slowly and that you should also learn about the Heimlich maneuver. You might have to use it on somebody.""
Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.

175,331,"Many people think that the new millennium began on January 1, 2000. But they're wrong. The new millennium actually begins January 1, 2001. That's because the calendar we use doesn't have a year zero. Our present calendar actually began with the year 1.
A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year.
It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble.
Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas.
The United States was the top medal winner at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The United States took home a total of 97 medals, 39 of which were gold.
There were some spectacular events in this year's Summer Games. One of the highlights was the victory of U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner (left) over Russian Alexander Karelin. Gardner beat Karelin, who had not lost a match in 13 years, by 1 point.
received its first long-term guests in November. The station, which is being built with help from 16 nations, was first put in orbit in 1998.
According to NASA (the U.S. space agency), the station should be completed by 2006 and will weigh more than 1 million pounds. Scientists will stay in the
to conduct long-term experiments that cannot be done on Earth.
Terrorism struck Americans on October 12 when a bomb ripped a huge hole in the side of the Navy destroyer USS
. The ship was docked in Aden. Yemen, a country in the Middle East.
U.S. officials said that the attack occurred when two men in a rubber boat exploded a bomb next to one side of the
. The blast killed 17 sailors and injured dozens of others. Another ship carried the
to the United States, where it will be rebuilt.
More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be.
On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.

176,101,"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is the
Bush wants to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality.
To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants.
President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires.
The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles.
Kerry wants to do more to keep our waterways free from pollution.
Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws.
Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply.
If elected, Kerry proposes to give more money to national parks. He says that Bush has let companies cut down too many trees.
Kerry also opposes Bush's plan to drill for oil in Alaska. Kerry wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using new forms of energy. He also supports the making of more fuel-efficient vehicles.

177,769,"Police officers in several towns in Massachusetts are pulling drivers over and giving them presents.
The officers have started Buckle Up for Bucks, a program that rewards people who wear their seat belts. Officers reward people who wear seat belts by handing out doughnuts and raffle tickets for savings bonds.
""It works,"" said police officer John Janulewicz. ""If we can get them [people] in the habit of buckling up, it will reduce injuries."" The police say the number of people who wear seat belts has gone up by 10 percent.

178,694,"Should handheld video games be banned from recess?
Many kids think playing handheld video games is a great way to spend their break time at school, but not all parents and school officials agree. Florence Rideout Elementary School in Wilton, New Hampshire, recently banned handheld electronic games, such as the PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo Dual Screen, at recess. Other schools across the country have taken the same action. Should portable video games be allowed on the playground?
Some school officials and parents argue that portable video games defeat the purpose of recessexercise. Lisa Lewis, a parent at Florence Rideout, told the school board that students should be encouraged to ""go out and play"" and not huddle around an electronic game.
In addition, portable video-game systems can stir up trouble. When students bring their gaming gear to school, fights sometimes start or the device gets stolen. Educators hope that keeping video games at home will help keep the peace at school. School officials at Florence Rideout added the video game ban to school rules to satisfy some parents' concerns.
Don't toss out video games from recess, say others. A recent report from the NPD Group shows that video games are becoming more
or established, in kids' daily lives. NPD reports that 41 percent of students between the ages of 4 and 14 own portable video game systems. ""Today's kids are digital [citizens] whose activities are different [from those of] previous generations,"" says Anita Frazier of NPD.
Some people argue that electronic devices are a part of modern life, the same way jacks and marbles once were. Would schools ban those games just because they don't require exercise, they ask?
Video games are part of everyday life.

179,665,"In San Francisco, baseball last season went to the dogs-- Portuguese water dogs, that is.
A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove.
BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships.
A local animal shelter, Pets In Need, auctioned the balls that Rio, Shadow, Topper, Surfer, Kyma, and Justy retrieved. The money is used to help other animals at the shelter.

Thermometers work because the liquid inside them expands and rises up the tube when it gets hotter.
Metal parts can be fitted together without welding using shrink fitting. The animation shows how this works.
The rod is too big to fit through the hole.
Materials expanding and contracting can also cause problems. For example, bridges expand in the summer heat and need special joints to stop them bending out of shape.

182,65,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Graphs
As well as solving simultaneous equations algebraically, you can solve them by rearranging them into the form of y = mx+c so that you can plot as straight line graphs. When you have plotted the graphs, you can work out the values of x and y that solve the equations.
To refresh your knowledge of straight line graphs, look at
Use the graphical method to solve the simultaneous equations:
Start by rearranging the two equations to get them in the form:
In this case you only need to rearrange the second equation. The two equations are now:
We now have two equations of straight-line graphs, which we can plot.
When we do this we can look at where the two lines cross (the point of
). The values of x and y at this point are the solutions of the simultaneous equations.
The solution of this pair of simultaneous equations is
x = 2 and y = 4

183,487,"It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements.
Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.
You write sentences all the time. Find out when and where to use them.

184,336,"When describing coordinates, always count from the origin.
For example, to describe the position of point A, start at the origin and move two squares in the horizontal (x) direction. Then move three squares in the vertical (y) direction.
The coordinates of point A are therefore (2, 3).

185,619,"> Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Atoms and elements - Metals v non-metals
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties.
Solid (except mercury, which is a liquid)
About half are solids, about half are gases, and one (bromine) is a liquid
High (they feel heavy for their size)
Low (they feel light for their size)
Brittle (they break or shatter when hammered)
Poor (they are insulators, apart from graphite)
They make a ringing sound (they are sonorous)
Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others
For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.

187,330,"Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called
Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother.
Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection.
Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see.
Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour.
He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.
Is it instinct or conditioning that makes you study science?

190,70,"> Time - 12-hour and 24-hour clock
am is the time from 12 midnight and before 12 noon.
pm is the time from 12 noon and before 12 midnight.
means 23 minutes past 6 in the morning
means quarter to 8 in the morning
The 24-hour clock does not require the use of am or pm. Afternoon is indicated by a number bigger than 12.
When converting from the 12-hour clock to the 24-hour clock remember:
for any time after 12.59pm, add 12.
, so for any time before 10:00 a zero is placed at the beginning.

191,267,"> Food chains - Respiration in plants
All living things get the energy they need to live from a chemical reaction called
. This process needs glucose as a starting point. First we'll see how respiration works, and then look at how plants use respiration in combination with photosynthesis.
is the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

193,22,"> The Tempest Summary - Prospero revealed
Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

202,77,"We often make judgments as to whether an event will take place, and use words to describe how probable that event is. For example, we might say that it is likely that the sun will come up tomorrow, or that it is impossible to find somebody who is more than 3m tall.
Probabilities can be written as fractions, decimals or percentages.
You can also use a probability scale, starting at 0 (impossible) and ending at 1 (certain).
Here are some events placed on the probability scale.

203,265,"> Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
Argue, persuade and advise - Writing to persuade
When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it.
But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is:
- if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to...
- it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to...
- If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit.
- don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time.
- using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we?
- why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not?
- words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers?
For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students"".

Collecting and recording data - Continuous data
. Examples include time, height and weight.
Because continuous data can take any value, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. So
before it can be represented in a frequency table or statistical diagram.
When choosing groups for the data, make sure that each piece of data can be placed in one (and only one) of the groups.
You are investigating the length of time each member of a class spends on the internet per week. Look at the class groupings below - do you think they are right?
, because the times of '10 hours' and '20 hours' can be entered into two different groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can be entered into 0  time 10 (where time is less than or equal to 10 hours), and also into 10  time  20 (where time is more than or equal to 10 hours).
, because the times '10 hours' and '20 hours' cannot be entered into any of the groups.
For example, the time 10 hours can neither be entered into 0 < time < 10 (where time is less than 10 hours), nor can it be entered into 10 < time < 20 (where time is more than 10 hours).
'10 hours' is included in the second group, but not the first and '20 hours' is included in the third group, but not the second.

208,229,"should introduce the subject. The writer wants to catch the reader's attention and hint at what is to come. If the beginning is poor, the reader could lose interest quickly and stop reading.
section presents the main ideas, thoughts, actions and so on. These will often be presented in stages or with several twists and turns of argument.
generally sums up the piece of text, or makes a final point, or brings a conclusion to a story.
It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question.
A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness?
Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health.
Beginning: do people need to be fit?
Health angle  unfit people can need more health care
Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit
This is an example of quite a straightforward plan. Each box contains a summary of a paragraph and they are organised in a way that steers the reader through a journey. Obviously, the more complex the issue, argument, story, and so on, the more complex the plan will be.

The Tempest first key extract - Language
When talking about the language, the things to concentrate on are:
The part that illusion has to play
The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion
Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her.
Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour.
The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic.

Electric current and voltage - Circuit symbols
We use circuit symbols to draw diagrams of electrical circuits, with straight lines to show the wires. The diagram shows some common circuit symbols.
Notice the difference between the symbol for a
? The battery is made from joining cell symbols together.
Think of what we usually call a single battery, like the type you put in a torch. In physics, each of these is actually called a
- it is only when you have two or more of these cells connected together that you call it a battery.
The idea of a circuit diagram is to use circuit symbols instead of drawing each component in the circuit. Always try to make the wires
lines, and don't be tempted to make them wiggly.
The whole point is to make it easier to see what is connected to what. Here you can see how the symbols for a cell (not a battery!) and a lamp look in a circuit diagram.
If you have to draw a circuit diagram from scratch, it is usually easier to draw the circuit symbols first, and then add all the wires. If you have to draw wires to join circuit symbols that are already shown, use a ruler and don't let the wires cross each other.

212,254,"> Whole numbers - Writing and describing
When describing whole numbers, remember the place values of the original digits.
However, some digits are 'joined' in their description. For example - when describing the number 35, we do not say 'three tens and five units', but instead describe it by the more common name of 'thirty five'.
In the same way the thousands, ten-thousands and hundred-thousands columns are usually described together. Here are some examples.
2 000 is described as 'two thousand'
62 000 is described as 'sixty two thousand', and
162 000 is described as 'one hundred and sixty-two thousand'
The number 3 147 286 can be written in words as
three million, one hundred and forty seven thousand, two hundred and eighty six.
Q1. Describe the numbers 4 235 225 in words.
Q2. Write twenty-three thousand and fifty six in figures
A1. Four million, two hundred and thirty five thousand, two hundred and twenty five.

213,278,"Behaviour can be investigated in the field or in the laboratory.
It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works.
Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals.
Fieldwork does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory.
Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds.
Scientists can tag sharks to study their behaviour.
Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean.
Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites.
Animals can be tagged by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make.
The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions.
The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions:
The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.

215,539,"> Variation and classification - Genetic engineering
Variation in living organisms can also be created by
Using laboratory techniques scientists can alter the genetic code within the DNA of a living organism. They can add genes from a different species to an organism's DNA
For example, GM can be used to alter the DNA in a bacterium so that it produces insulin. This is a human hormone and valuable to people with diabetes. Bacteria reproduce quickly, so a lot of insulin can be made quickly and used to help people suffering from diabetes.
Some people are concerned that there may be negative aspects to GM.
For example, there are people that believe GM is unethical and should be banned.
Other people are concerned that there may be unexpected long term problems of using GM, producing changes that could not be reversed. Such changes could create new pathogens or ""superweeds"" by the GM organisms breeding with other species. This could cause the natural balance of living organisms in the environment to be upset.

Graphs - Plotting ax + by = c
Tables work well when you're plotting graphs of the form y = mx + c, but what happens when the equation isn't in this form?
Plot the graph of 2y - 4x = 3
in the form y = mx + c. You need to rearrange the equation into a form with just the y value on the left of the equation.
So add 4x to both sides to give
To find y divide both sides by 2 to give
Now that you have found the equation in terms of y, you can plot the graph using the usual method.

217,403,"> Reproduction - Fertilisation and foetal development
During sexual intercourse the man's penis releases semen into the woman's vagina. Sperm cells travel in semen from the penis and into the top of the vagina. They enter the uterus through the cervix and travel to the egg tubes. If a sperm cell meets with an egg cell there, fertilisation can happen. Fertilisation happens when an egg cell meets with a sperm cell and joins with it.
The fertilised egg divides to form a ball of cells called an
. This attaches to the lining of the uterus and begins to develop into a
The foetus relies upon its mother as it develops. These are some of the things it needs:
It also needs its waste substances removing.
The foetus is protected by the uterus and the
, a liquid contained in a bag called the
is responsible for providing oxygen and nutrients, and removing waste substances. It grows into the wall of the uterus and is joined to the foetus by the
with the foetus's blood, but the placenta lets substances pass between the two blood supplies:
across the placenta from the mother to the foetus
waste substances, such as carbon dioxide, diffuse across the placenta from the foetus to the mother.

Measures of average - Mean and modal class
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean.
This table shows the weights of children in a class.
To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group).
Do the same for all the other groups:
a) Estimate of mean = 1215  25 =
b) The modal class is the class that has the highest frequency. In this case the modal class is

The components in a circuit are joined by wires.
if there are no branches then it's a series circuit
if there are branches it's a parallel circuit
In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other. A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the other.
If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches.
If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before.
In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working.
Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits.
In parallel circuits different components are connected on different branches of the wire. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you can only pass through all the different components if you follow all the
In a parallel circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected from one parallel wire, the components on different branches
. And, unlike a series circuit, the lamps stay bright if you add more lamps in parallel.
Parallel circuits are useful if you want everything to work, even if one component has failed. This is why our homes are wired up with parallel circuits.

223,16,"Pythagoras' Theorem states that for all right-angled triangles,
'The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides'
. (The hypotenuse is the longest side and it's always opposite the right angle)
the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
and angle A is a right angle.
Pythagoras' Theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle.
Which of the following triangles is right-angled?

229,522,"Liquids and gases do not have a fixed shape. They can flow and fill their containers, but solids cannot. The particle model explains why.
Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.
In order to see this content you need to have both
Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.

230,594,"is a category within the classification system. Living things of the same type belong to the same species. For example, humans are one species and dogs are another species.
Individuals of the same species can reproduce to make more individuals of the same species. Two individuals belonging to different species cannot normally reproduce together. If they do, their offspring is usually infertile and unable to reproduce.
For example animals called ligers are produced when a male lion and a female tiger reproduce. But a liger cannot have offspring. This means that lions and tigers are different species.
All people are human. They belong to the same species. Your friends and classmates may have different eye colour and hair colour. Some will be boys and some will be girls. Some will be tall and some will be shorter. The presence of differences between living things of the same species is called variation.
Variation between different species is always greater than the variation within a species.

231,557,"> Variation and classification - Classifying organisms
There are millions of species on our planet. It would be difficult if we just tried to describe and name each one individually. Although species can be very different from each other, many of them have similar features that allow us to put them into groups.
In the eighteenth century Carl Linnaeus started the modern system of putting species of organism into certain groups and giving them scientific names. Each species is given a name using Latin words, so that the same name can be used all over the world.

232,11,"> The Tempest Summary - The banquet
Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears Ferdinand and Miranda say they love each other. He finally approves of their love.
On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.
A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage.
Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate.
Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano in a smelly pool
Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs.
Prospero is pleased with Ariel, and promises he'll soon be free.

If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14.
What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out.
1 week is 1  7 days = 7
2 weeks is 2  7 days = 14
3 weeks is 3  7 days = 21
4 weeks is 4  7 days = 28
So, the formula to work out the number of days is:
number of days = number of weeks  7
Q1. How many pence are there in 1?

235,154,"> Inform, explain and describe - Describing
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this:
My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres...
This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do?
The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer?
You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him.
Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.

236,353,"The commonly used metric units of length include:
To find a suitable unit to measure something in, you should first estimate how big it is. So, for example, do you think it's better to measure the distance between London and Manchester in metres or kilometres? Or, should an insect be measured in metres or millimetres?
Imagine the length of the objects you are estimating or imagine measuring them in relation to other objects. For example:
Imagine a metre ruler next to a tall man. You would expect him to be taller than 1 ruler, but not as tall as 3 rulers.
Imagine a bag of sugar on some scales. You would expect the needle to move round a little, but not to whizz round to 50kg.
Imagine a 1-litre bottle of cola. You would expect it to hold approximately the same amount as a large flask.
Q1. Which unit of measurement (km, m, cm or mm) would you use for the following?
b) the length of a football pitch
d) the distance from London to Manchester
a) Is the height of a tall man likely to be 90cm, 180cm or 360cm?
b) Is the weight of a bag of sugar about 1kg, 10kg or 50kg?
c) Does a large flask hold roughly 200ml, 1l or 10l of liquid?

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as
. Think of what happens when you rub your hands together quickly. The friction warms them up.
as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

At the beginning of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, guards patrolling the castle wall at night are waiting for a ghost to reappear - they're afraid. They think it's the ghost of Hamlet's father who's just died. They call Hamlet's friend Horatio to come and see if the ghost will appear again.

239,112,"> Drama - Working from a script
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience.
Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense.
To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause.
Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball:
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
But old folks, many feign as they were dead -
Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.

, and is famous for his use of
Descriptions of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Things that represent other things.
Explicit comparisons of one thing to another, using the words 'like' or 'as'. 'Sleeping like a log' and 'bright as a button' are similes.
. His descriptions often present people, their surroundings, and even the weather, in ways which reinforce each other, so that a certain 'feel' is built up through the passage.
From the early 1850s, Dickens gave public readings of his novels. His writing is

241,2123,"Fractions, decimals and percentages can all represent the same information. But can you convert between them?
To change a fraction to a decimal, you divide the top number by the bottom number. (Divide the numerator by the denominator.)
to a decimal, we calculate 3  8
Some decimals will terminate (end) like the example above, but many will not.
There are some fraction/decimal equivalents that you should be familiar with:
If the decimal terminates (ends), the denominator will be 10, or 100, or 1000 or (depending on the number of decimal places).
0.5 means 'five tenths, so 0.5 =
0.45 means '45 hundredths', so 0.45 =
0.240 means 240 thousandths, so 0.240 =
If the decimal repeats with a single digit, the denominator will be 9:
If the decimal repeats with two digits, the denominator will be 99:
If the decimal does not repeat at all it is known as an irrational number, and you cannot write it as a fraction.

what they think they want right now
what they want in the long term
Choose one of the faces above to create a character.
Before you write consider what you can tell about this person from:
What kind of background have they come from?
What kind of a person might they be?
Where have they been and where are they going?
What are they thinking right at that moment?
What might be their weaknesses and their strengths?

246,6710,"The elements in group 7 are called the halogens. They belong to the column second from right in the periodic table. The halogens are all toxic, but this is a useful property. Chlorine is used to sterilise drinking water and water in swimming pools. Iodine is used in antiseptics to treat wounds.
The halogens have the following properties in common:
they have low melting and boiling points
they are poor conductors of heat and electricity

247,4254,"The formula for finding the circumference of a circle is C = 2
r. So it is easy to find the circumference if we know the radius.
What happens, though, if we know the circumference but want to know the radius?
In this case we can rearrange to make r the subject of the formula.
r, so we divide both sides by 2
The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c
Rearrange the formula to make 'c' the subject.
[To work this out: y = mx + c, so subtract mx from both sides.]
See if you can do it better than Einstein!
Make sure your maths skills add up.

248,3919,"The Romans are known to have had some knowledge of the internal workings of human bodies, particularly through the work of Galen. However, historians question whether they performed internal surgical operations.
Through their work with gladiators and wounded soldiers, Roman doctors became experts at
They could do a large number of simple external operations, such as removing polyps up the nose and goitres from the neck.
Ancient Roman doctor treating a patient's goitre
We know that the Romans developed new
(though they look barbaric to us nowadays). They also developed the Caesarean section to remove a baby from the womb (although it is not true that Julius Caesar was born this way). In those times the mother always died - Roman Caesarean sections were usually performed to save the baby of a woman who had died during childbirth.
We have no evidence that Roman surgeons successfully operated inside the body. Roman doctors
, and had only herbal antiseptics - so successful surgical operations would have been extremely difficult for them to perform.

253,1173,"This modern story about conflict between a mother and her teenage daughter was published in 1991. The mother is the narrator of the story, so we only see things from her point of view.
""You're not here any longer so how can I speak to you?""
A woman who is deeply upset lies in her daughter's darkened bedroom. She clutches a pair of new white trainers that were a present for her daughter.
In the first sentence, we discover that the narrator is telling the story to another character - the daughter - but the daughter is not there to hear it. This style of writing is sometimes called a
An extended speech performed by one person only
, because there is only one character speaking or thinking.
Her 15-year-old daughter has run away from home. The woman worries that her daughter may have to beg for food to survive, or that she has been forced to become a prostitute.
We are told there was an argument between the father and daughter. Bad language was used on both sides.
The doctor has signed the narrator off work; she is taking medication. The mother aims to pretend to the outside world that everything is okay, but fears her daughter may be dead, or at least living on the streets.
We learn more about the argument. The daughter is brought home drunk at 3am. The father calls her a 'dirty slut'.

254,2454,"He seems to enjoy life! We know right from the start that he has a sense of humour, since his first words are
""Good signors both, when shall we laugh?""
He has already spent his own fortune having a good time.
When he first talks of marrying Portia, we wonder about his motives - he seems more interested in her money than anything else when he describes her to Antonio:
""In Belmont is a lady richly left, / And she is fair""
However, when he has to choose between the caskets, he says that he is tortured -
- not knowing whether he can marry her or not.
When he sees her portrait inside the lead casket, he praises her highly and calls her a

He leaves Portia immediately to return to Venice to help Antonio in prison, but says he won't sleep until he meets her again.
Yet, during the trial, he tells Antonio he would sacrifice
""life itself, my wife and all the world to save him.""
He does not recognise Portia in disguise.
He is very reluctant to give 'Balthazar' the ring that Portia gave him, yet does so when Antonio asks him to.
He gives an honest account of why he gave the ring away and swears heartfelt and lifelong devotion to Portia -
- at the end of the play.
Like Antonio, he is prejudiced against Shylock.
He is anxious about the deal that Antonio makes with Shylock, calling Shylock
He helps in the elopement of Jessica with Lorenzo by inviting Shylock to dinner on the night they escape.
During the trial, he tries to persuade Balthazar to change the law in favour of Antonio, calling Shylock

255,7341,"When there is a chemical reaction, air pollutants are produced. You can understand how these pollutants are formed by looking at what happens to atoms during these chemical reactions.
A compound is a substance formed by the chemical union (involving bond formation) of two or more elements.
tells you how many atoms of each element the molecule contains. The table below shows the formulae of some compounds, together with the number of atoms of each element in each molecule and a diagram of each molecule.
The table shows the formulae of some compounds, with the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.
A small (subscript) number after a symbol tells you how many atoms of that particular element are in the molecule. If there is only one atom of an element in a molecule, we do not write the number 1 after the symbol. For example, the water molecule H

260,3288,"When comparing poems, be sure to consider their similarities and differences. Comparison will help give new meaning to the poems. This revision bite gives you the chance to think about which poems might be suitable to compare with Patrolling Barnegat.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914, comparing and contrasting them with each other. The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before...
Now's your chance to get in some practice comparing poems. The table on the next page shows some pre- and post-1914 poems you may have studied which would be suitable for comparing with
. We have suggested some points of
A description of the similarities and differences between two things (in this case, two texts).
A description of all the differences between two things (in this case, two texts).
which you could include in your answer - but feel free to think of some others!
When you are asked to compare poems it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in this module:

261,4377,"Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide.
Steel and aluminium have advantages and disadvantages when used to make cars, which are recycled to re-use valuable materials and cut down on waste.
Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. Both water and oxygen are needed for rusting to occur. In the experiment below, the nail does not rust when air - containing oxygen - or water is not present:
Calcium chloride absorbs water in the right-hand test tube
Salt dissolved in water does not cause rusting, but it does speed it up, as does acid rain.
Aluminium does not rust - corrode. Its surface is protected by a natural layer of aluminium oxide. This prevents the metal below from coming into contact with air and oxygen.
Unlike rust, which can flake off the surface of iron and steel objects, the layer of aluminium oxide does not flake off.
reaction. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to form
, which we see as rust. Here is the word equation for the reaction:
iron + water + oxygen    hydrated iron(III) oxide
Most iron is converted into steel - an alloy - before being used. Compared to iron, steel is:
Iron and aluminium are used to build cars. They are both malleable - they can be bent or pressed into shape - and both are good electrical conductors.
A summary of the differences betwen iron and aluminium
Aluminium has some advantages over steel. Since it has a lower density than iron or steel, a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel. This results in improved fuel economy. Also, aluminium does not corrode easily, so a car body made from aluminium will corrode less, and may last longer, than one made from steel.
However, aluminium is more expensive than steel. So a car made from aluminium is likely to be more expensive than one made from steel.
Cars are complex machines. Many different materials are used in their manufacture.
The main materials used in the manufacture of cars
tough and easily moulded to desired shape

265,729,"This Revision Bite will help you understand the different types of production costs and how to calculate them.
A manufacturing company's production department will need to consider the quality and quantity of a product in relation to cost. If a firm wants to make a profit, it has to know what it is spending as well as what it is earning. Here are some of the costs it needs to know to do this:
Now look at each of these costs in more detail:
These costs do not change however many units of a product are made. Factory rent, insurance premiums and administration salaries stay the same, whether the factory is working at full capacity or producing nothing. The owner of the business may have taken out a loan to buy equipment or refurbish a building. The loan will have to be repaid whether or not the business has customers.
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
changes. For example, the amount of raw materials needed varies as the levels of output go up or down.
The employee is paid according to the number of units produced.
wages also fluctuate, depending on the employees' efficiency and the demand for the company's products.
The fixed costs and the variable costs are added together to establish the total costs. The fixed costs remain constant, but the variable costs increase in direct proportion with output.
The amount spent on producing one extra unit. It is the increase in total cost when one more unit is produced.
is a way of measuring how much more it will cost a company to make one more individual item. Here is an example:
A company produces compact discs. It has produced 99 CDs and the total costs have amounted to 999. If the total costs increase to 1,000 when the hundredth CD is made the marginal cost of the last CD is 1.00.
The firm knows that now each CD should cost only 1.00 or less to produce. As the cost per unit usually decreases with a rise in output, it should become cheaper to produce each one. The firm may be able to offer a more competitive price to customers.
The example of the CD shows the benefits of economies of scale, where mass production results in a lower unit cost. The reason is that the fixed costs do not change and are spread across a greater level of output.
The amount spent on producing each unit of output. It is calculated by dividing the total level of cost by the level of output.
helps a firm to monitor its progress, and makes it easier to set prices. It is calculated by dividing total cost by total output.
Using the example of the compact disc firm above:
This might seem expensive, but if the firm produces another hundred units at a marginal cost of 1.00 per CD, its average cost will fall radically:
The firm can use this information to decide whether it is worth accepting a new order for goods.
The examiner will want to see that you understand what the different costs are, how they are calculated, and why it is important for a firm to work them out. You will be expected to apply your understanding to a real life situation.
A company will always incur costs, no matter how efficient it is. Wages,
Raw materials are anything naturally occurring in or on the earth/in the sea before being processed. These are obtained through primary activities such as mining, fishing, forestry and farming.
, transport and power all have to be paid for. The company needs to establish all its costs to ensure it doesn't lose money.
Read the case study and answer the question below
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with 1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a 550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back 50 a month. They also have to pay the bank 50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves 50 a month each.
What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks)
When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.
They have got to pay back the money they borrowed.
Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are.
They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business.
Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs.
Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad 50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay.
Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.

Which of the following triangles (P, Q or R) is a translation of triangle ABC?
a translation of triangle ABC. Triangle ABC has been translated 3 squares to the right and 2 squares up.
a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image are facing in opposite directions.
a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image have different side lengths. They are different shapes.
When we translate an object, every vertex (corner) must be moved in the same way.
Triangle PQR has been translated 3 squares down and 4 squares to the right. All of the vertices have been translated in the same way, and the object and its image are exactly the same shape and size.

267,3582,"This Revision Bite is about how people communicate with each other in a business setting.
It will help you understand why communication is such an important issue and examines various methods of getting a message across in different situations.
Communicating means passing on information, or receiving it from somebody else. Imagine the problems that could occur if this is not done carefully. Here are some examples of what might go wrong:
Delivering the wrong items to a customer.
Delivering correspondence on the wrong date or to the wrong address.
Management using incorrect data when making decisions.

270,2826,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Both poems are about water when it is dangerous. Clarke describes a near-drowning while Heaney describes the savage sea in a storm.
In Clarke's poem the water seems to subtly hide its dangers (e.g. satiny mud blooms in cloudiness) but Heaney recognises its force and violence - the flung spray hits the very windows.
Clarke uses the image of water to question our powers of memory, whereas Heaney uses it to show the power of nature.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Like Heaney, Whitman describes a violent storm at sea.
Like Clarke, however, Whitman hints at the supernatural. His references to demoniac laughter and the savage trinity seem on the surface more threatening than the fairytale references in Clarke's poem.
We question the endings of both poems. We wonder about the dim weird forms that Whitman sees and about the lost things that Clarke imagines drowned in the lake.
Both poets are writing from a personal viewpoint.
Yet for Clare, the water is innocent. It is part of the beauty of summer as it supports the wildlife: marsh marigolds and water lilies, moor hens and insects. Clarke also suggests the beauty of the water (e.g. long green silk), but for her it could be hiding something potentially sinister, while for Clare it is simply the clear lake.
The sonnet form suggests Clare's love of the water, while Clarke's use of alternating stanzas and half rhyme suggests an uncertainty. She cannot be sure what is under the water; she cannot be sure of her memory.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Examiner's advice - break down your answer
Hace dos meses pasaste une semana en un colegio espaol
The question does give you most of your introduction, but don't forget to change the verb to refer to yourself.
If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.
Where times or parts of the day are referred to, extend them to make suitable expressions of time.
You are writing about what the Spanish school was like, so use the imperfect tense. Use the first person plural to say what we did.
Sometimes you may have to change the tense from the one in the notes.
You may need to use the verb comer instead of the noun
Be prepared to make some guesses of your own. If there was no canteen where did the pupils eat? Probably at home!
Did you do the homework as well? If not, refer to Marisol and show you can use a different verb ending.
Don't just stick to the notes here. Add something to introduce the next point. It's time to give your opinion.
If necessary, add something extra to set the scene.
Remember to change the tense to fit.
Which expressions of time should you use?
Don't forget to put an article before the days of the week.
You are now talking about the situation generally, so you probably need to use the present tense.
Remember to compare Spanish and English holidays.
Show that you know the difference between
Take this opportunity to put in another different tense.
You will generally be told about how many words to write. Take note of this because you won't get any more marks for writing too much and you may lose marks for writing too little.
Use what you're given. The question and the notes both give you lots of language that you can use in your answer.
Remember to adapt the information in the question so that any verbs and pronouns refer to whoever you're writing about.
If you have to work from notes, think about the way they would be set out in English and what you would have to add.
Think carefully about what tense and what person of the verb to use. Once you have decided, make sure that you use that tense and person every time it's appropriate.
After you have finished, check your work for verb endings and tenses.

274,5500,"Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the
it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's
he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the
The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text.
of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should this poem be read:
in a solemn, decisive way, showing Heaney's confidence that he will be able to survive the storm?
in a relaxed, chatty way - suggesting that conversation takes his mind off the storm?
in a frightened way, betraying anxiety and fear?
In a way all three tones would be appropriate, because the poem starts off expressing chatty confidence in the island's ability to shrug off the storm. Midway through, however, the use of phrases like 'full / Blast, 'the thing you fear', 'Exploding comfortably' betrays anxiety mixed in with the bravado; while by the end of the poem the storm has become frightening and violent - a spitting cat, a strafing dive-bomber.
The ideas in this poem concern our uneasy relationship to powerful natural forces, and the feelings of vulnerability and fear we feel in the face of the potentially destructive might of a storm. Have a look at these quotes from the poem, and our suggestions about how these ideas are expressed in each of them.
We are prepared: we build our houses squat...
The opening words of the poem suggests a community readying itself to endure wartime bombing or bombardment - an idea which Heaney returns to at the end of the poem.
But there are no trees, no natural shelter.
Heaney seems affectionate towards the island at first, wryly admitting it has never troubled them, yet here the But is significant: it is as if the island has let them down. They are at the mercy of the storm with no natural shelter.
We just sit tight while wind dives And strafes invisibly
Heaney recognises that he is powerless in the storm. There is nothing that man can do but sit tight while the wind attacks. It's like being under enemy fire.
Heaney finds their fears strange because the object of fear is not tangible - it's 'a huge nothing'. So are the fears imaginary or real? Is he afraid of the wind, or doesn't he know what to be afraid of?

275,5289,"Are you able to watch Spanish TV at home or in school on satellite or cable? Being able to understand programme titles and types is very useful and it's a really important exam skill too.
This exercise talks you through a question based on a page from a TV guide.
Read through this TV guide then have a look at the questions that follow.
This is a TV guide for Santiago Atitln, a small town in Guatemala:
Deporte: Final de la Copa de Europa
Decide whether these statements about the television guide are
Hay un programa de dibujos animados a las seis y media.
Se puede ver el partido de ftbol a las once.
Hay un programa de msica esta noche.
El parte meteorolgico es a las siete y media.
Hay un programa sobre la naturaleza a las nueve y media.
Los programas se terminan a las tres y media.
- The fact that Disney is mentioned means cartoons and the time is right too!
- Careful! There is a sports programme at 11 but the football is actually on the earlier sports programme at 8.
isn't mentioned on the page, there's a concert, which of course counts as a music programme.
was the weather you should have been able to link it with
- There is a nature programme but it's at 7.
gives you a clue about the type of film.
Don't just read it, practise your Spanish with downloadable audio bites.
Use your language skills in this sinister game of intrigue and detection.
Real Spanish, real drama from BBC languages.

281,7331,"One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906-1914. Many historians label this period the beginning of the
A state (or a country) where the government provides welfare benefits such as education, health care, and unemployment payment to its population free at the point of use, although paid for by general taxation.
, but why did the Liberal government introduce its reforms?
Some governments in history seem to have implemented changes that have particularly improved people's lives. For instance, Roosevelt's New Deal in America, or the Labour government in Britain after the First World War. The dynamism and positive achievements of these governments make them look much better than the governments that came before or after them.
A study of poverty in 1901 by Seebohm Rowntree found that in a society where those who didn't work didn't eat, there were three times in people's lives when they were especially vulnerable:
After 1906, the Liberal government, with Lloyd George as Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced reforms to help these three groups:
Children and Young Persons Act introduced a set of regulations that became known as the

was passed. Part 1 of the act gave people the right to
of 10s a week for 26 weeks in return for a payment of 4d a week. Part 2 of the Act gave people the right to unemployment pay (
) of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2d a week.
1906 - the Trades Disputes Act ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.
1906 - the Workers Compensation Act granted compensation for injury at work.
1910 - half-day a week off for shop workers.
A Merchant Shipping Act improved conditions for sailors.
From 1911, MPs were paid. This gave working men the opportunity to stand for election.
Why did the Liberal government introduce these reforms?
in 1901 found that 28 per cent of the population did not have the minimum to live on at some time of their life.
- when Britain went to war in 1899, the army found that two-thirds of the men who volunteered for the army were unfit to join up.
- which had a good system of state welfare for workers, was passing Britain as a great industrial power.
meant politicians feared that, unless standards of living improved for the workers, they might turn to Communism or rebellion.
and it was attracting working-class voters because of its demands for welfare reform.
Liberal Party did not get a majority
of seats in the House of Commons, so it had a coalition with the 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected.
Many government politicians, especially Lloyd George, genuinely wanted to

By 1914, 1 million people were being employed through the labour exchange.
Most of these jobs were temporary or part-time; the government did not do anything to increase the number of jobs available.

Poor people had to pay the contributions out of their wages; dole and sickness pay only lasted for a limited time; and

was not enough to live on - a family of five needed 1 a week.
Only for the wage-earner - it was not available to their wife or children.
A plan for expected income and spending over a specified time period.
- to pay for the reforms, Lloyd George's 1909 budget raised duties on tobacco and spirits, raised income tax by 16 per cent (from 1s to 1s 2d), and introduced a new 20 per cent tax on profits from selling land.
When the House of Lords refused to pass Lloyd George's budget, the House of Commons passed an Act stating that the House of Lords could not reject a bill that had been passed three times in the House of Commons. It also required a general election every five, not seven, years.
Lloyd George became loved - old people cried when they got their pension and blessed 'Lord George' who gave them - and hated - workers who objected to paying national insurance chanted: 'Taffy was a Welshman, taffy was a thief' at him.

282,3656,"These are standard tests to assess how well particular types of
a general term used to describe an application or a program
work. They are used to evaluate new software and hardware releases using a series of scored tests. Many computer magazines publish the test results. A typical test for a printer might be how long it takes to print a page of text.
It's a good way of getting cheap advice on the suitability of one product when compared to what else is available.
Benchmark tests may not include a feature that is really important to a particular end user. In fact they may be based on features the user may not be interested in at all.

283,1835,"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to
microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses
, and therefore its ability to stay fresh.
Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.
Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

288,6661,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.
This is how Samus's prompt card might look in Irish:
- sprt agus peil Ghaelach, Peadar  Ceannabhin (33, beag, tana, lidir, psta, trir clainne).
- Cluiche ceannais anuraidh in adan Ard Mhacha; Bhain Tr Eoghain; captaen; d'imir s go maith; cpla pointe; Sam Maguire, cisir mhr.
- acla; suim mhr sa pheil; Earagail Chiarin agus Tr Eoghain; peileadir iontach maith, sciliil; dograiseach; ag traenil gach l.
- minteoir corpoideachais, menscoil i gCo. Thr Eoghain; N bheidh s ag teagasc i mbliana; obair leis an pheil; an bhliain seo chugainn; r-aosta.
- peileadir den scoth; an-ssta, Sam Maguire; Tr Eoghain ab!
This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

describes the condition of the atmosphere. It might be sunny, hot, windy or cloudy, raining or snowing.
Temperature is how hot or cold something is, for example the atmosphere or the sea. Use a thermometer to see how many degrees Celsius/centigrade it is above or below freezing point (0 degrees C) .
Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.

The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

Computer-controlled warehouses need only a handful of staff to operate them.
Computer-controlled robots are now common on production lines, replacing human workers.
The old skills of workers in the printing industry are now out-of-date.
Some jobs have disappeared as they can now be done automatically, eg marking multiple choice exam papers.
However, it is fair to say that the development of information technology has led to many new jobs such as computer technicians, programmers,
includes all of the web pages accessible via the Internet
IT is more likely to have changed someone's work rather than led to them losing their job. People in certain professions have had to be retrained to make use of modern technology:
Travel agents book holidays by computer, not by phone or letter.
has meant that many bank staff now work by phone in front of a computer, instead of being in a branch, behind a counter.
De-skilling has taken place. Some jobs which needed a high level of skill in the past can now be done more easily. For example, print workers today can use
an application that allows text and images to be laid out on a page
used extensively in the automotive industry, aerospace industry, and in architectural design to draw 2D and 3D designs
rather than pencil and paper on a drawing board.
Products made with computers should be of a better quality than before. For example, car bodies are welded more accurately by robots than by humans.
Robots don't get tired so the quality of work is consistent.
Machines controlled by computer are more reliable than those controlled by humans.
Miniaturisation - many electrical items, such as mobile phones and video cameras have become much smaller due to developments in technology.
High street stores now find themselves competing with each other for business both on the high street and online.
opens the market to customers nationally and internationally
enables smaller companies to compete with larger companies
reduces in staffing and/or high street stores thereby reducing costs
provides the option to offer 24 hour shopping at minimum additional cost
- businesses once competing with the shop in the next town now find themselves competing on a global scale.
- with increased competition, local companies may have to reduce their work force.
- the move to e-commerce may not be a smooth one and will certainly require a degree of investment.
- if high street stores are closed in an effort to save money, customers who prefer to shop on the high street may not be comfortable buying online so may go elsewhere.
Now, both for companies and individuals, there is pressure to have Internet access to do everyday things such as submit orders or look up details in a catalogue. There are initiatives to make as many services available on the Internet as possible, including e-government, where government departments such as the Inland Revenue can be dealt with using secure
a web page or group of web pages hosted on one web server and viewed in a web browser
, means working from home using modern technology to keep in touch with your business. Jobs can be relocated to places where it is more attractive, more convenient or cheaper to live.
a global network connecting millions of computers
electronic mail - a message written or typed on a computer and sent electronically rather than by post
a technology used to digitise hard copies of documents, transfer them across the telephone network, and print them on receipt
Office running costs and overheads (rates, electricity, heating etc) can be reduced, which in turn may reduce the need for office space.
Travel-related problems may be reduced, ie staff being unable to get into work due to rail/road delays.
It may tempt better staff to come and work for the company.
Employers need to be able to trust their staff and be prepared to have less direct control over them.
work in a comfortable environment - their home
less human interaction - fewer opportunities to meet people, share ideas with etc.
more difficult to work as part of a team, especially if they're all office based
greater temptation to spend time on non-work-related activities
difficult to separate personal life from work
Video conferencing means using computers to provide a video-link between two or more people. Instead of just talking to someone by telephone, you are able to see them as well.
The following is needed to take part in a video conference call:
a microphone (most webcams have a microphone built-in)
a global network connecting millions of computers
a general term used to describe an application or a program
It is possible to buy a special video conferencing machine just for this purpose.
Meetings can take place without leaving the office.
Travel costs and the time taken to travel can be reduced significantly.
Meetings can be called instantly worldwide with little notice.
Delegates can still attend meetings even if they are physically unable to.
May not be as productive as a discussion around a table.
Confidential documents may need to be viewed and signed in person.
There will always be times when you need to be able to meet face to face.

are formed. Ions can be either positively or negatively charged.
For the Higher Tier, you need to know which ions are produced by acids, and which are produced by alkalis. You will also need to know the ionic equation for
Neutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt plus water.
When acids dissolve in water they produce hydrogen ions, H
. For example, looking at hydrochloric acid:
Remember that (aq) means the substance is in solution.
When alkalis dissolve in water they produce hydroxide ions, OH
. For example, looking at sodium hydroxide:
Ammonia is slightly different. This is the equation for ammonia in solution:
ions from an acid react with the OH
ions from an alkali, a neutralisation reaction occurs to form water. This is the equation for the reaction:
If you look at the equations above for sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, you will see that there are Na

295,391,"The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard.
So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below.
'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in
One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true.
Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent.
There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.

296,1543,"Life was very tough for early settlers and homesteaders on the Great Plains - how did they cope with the
Female homesteader, contemplating her life on the Plains
Early settlers and homesteader on the Plains faced huge problems. The burden of many of these fell on the women, whose lives were burdensome and unpleasant:
There was little wood to build log cabins.
Settlers built 'sod houses', while they lived out of doors - people did their cooking on an open fire.
Outdoor toilets and open wells. The sod houses leaked, and fleas and bedbugs lived in them 'by the million'. It was impossible to disinfect the floor. As a result the death rate, especially from diphtheria, was high.
A 'good thick coat of whitewash' killed bedbugs. 'A layer of clay' stopped leaks. Homesteaders eventually built more modern houses.
There was no wood for fuel, and no shops to buy items such as candles and soap. A typical household had only two buckets, some crockery and one cracked cup. There was no water and little food.
A travelling shoe-maker or tinker might pass through who would provide or mend household items, but usually families just had to make do. The women collected 'buffalo chips' for fuel, stoked the stove, and made their own candles and soap. 'I have often wondered how my mother stood it', wrote an early settler.
No doctors or midwives. No social life 'because of the distances between farmhouses'. In the winter families were shut in 'and longed for spring'.
People had to make the most of any trip to their nearest town, where the women talked of the harvest and the men smoked corncob pipes and talked politics.
Local government was non-existent, and some early lawmen (such as Henry Plummer) were worse than the bandits.
Law courts and sheriffs such as Wyatt Earp slowly established law and order.
To familiarise yourself with the content of this Revision Bite, reproduce the problems faced by
Settlers without the money to pay for land, who live on and cultivate land acquired under the Homestead Laws from the United States public lands.
