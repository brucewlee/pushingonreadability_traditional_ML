5968,"Calculating the interior and exterior angles of regular polygons
We already know how to find the sum of the interior angles of a polygon using the formula
We also know that all the interior angles of a regular polygon are equal.
Interior angle of a regular polygon = sum of interior angles  number of sides
Find the interior angle of a regular hexagon.
We know from the formula that the interior angles of a hexagon add up to 720.
As a hexagon has six sides, each angle is equal to
We know that the exterior angles of a regular polygon
add up to 360, so the exterior angle of a regular hexagon is
The interior angle and its corresponding exterior angle always add up to 180. (For a hexagon, 120 + 60 = 180.)
Calculate the exterior angle of a regular octagon, and write down the value of the interior angle.
The sum of the exterior and interior angles is 180, so the interior angle is 180 - 45 =

2464,"Your school plays a big part in shaping your attitudes towards sport. There are many roles you could try in addition to playing the sport, like coaching younger teams to see if teaching may be a hidden talent! Earning a qualification by taking courses and awards may help guide you towards longer-term job prospects.
Outside influences and social groupings may mean you take up a certain sport or avoid it altogether. One things certain, weve got more leisure time than ever, so why not do something physical with it?
Your school can influence you to become a lifelong participant in sport as a player, organiser or official. Schools have to teach PE within the National Curriculum. Within this you will experience a number of
. Each has benefits to you and others.
Improve your knowledge of the rules. Can still contribute when unable to play.
Allows teachers to teach rather than umpire/referee
Develop organisational skills, stay involved in sport if not able to participate
Enable sport to happen and arrange competitions etc
Outlet for creativity, develop ideas beyond your own ability
Provide exciting and challenging context for dancers
When thinking about the other ways in which school can influence the
of sports in which pupils participate, consider the ways in which each of the following has an impact:
- how do GCSE, JSLA etc help? Can these courses lead to a career in sport?
- does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts?
- what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons?
- are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isnt the same as theirs?
- are you introduced to clubs in the area?
Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participation
Role models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years.
Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case.
Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst womens football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels. So does the rising concern about safety which has stopped a lot of 'free play' on the streets and in parks.
A number of organisations have responsibility for sport and these both

are the groups to which you are 'attached' because of your circumstances. Social groupings can have either a positive or negative influence on your involvement in sport.
If they enjoy and play sport, you will join in.
If they do not share your interest, they can encourage you to give up sport.
An interest in specific sports will encourage participation. Inherited ability may help you to be successful. They provide good role models.
They may influence you to move away from a sport you like and towards their favourite sport. If they do not like sport, it may be hard for you to get support.
Boys often find it easier to access sport. Women are now active in developing women-only gyms and teams. This encourages participation.
Some people may expect you to conform to
An assumption based only on a general expectation.
behaviour. Opportunities for women are increasing, but support is still limited in some areas. Some religions do not encourage women to participate.
Some ethnic groups have a particular interest in certain sports. This cultural influence encourages participation.
Racist attitudes still make participation uncomfortable for some sportspeople, so they may quit.
All sports are available if you can afford them.
Sports needing lots of equipment, travel or expensive facilities are not available to those with little money.
Peer pressure can encourage or discourage participation. Photo courtesy of BBC Sport
The pressure to conform to the actions of people of the same age and background.
is very strong during the teenage years. This can encourage participation, or make it difficult to do your own thing.
Leisure time is the time we have when we are not working, taking care of ourselves or completing our family and home duties.
It has increased as a result of:
Better working conditions - paid holidays have increased
We can choose what we do in our leisure time. Local authorities and the leisure industry try to influence us to take part in physical activity and sport. Local authorities have targeted certain user groups by offering them
A reduction in the usual price of a ticket granted to a special group of customers, eg students
, such as special opening times, reduced fees and organised classes- to encourage participation.
Facilities are provided for participants of all ages and levels of ability including:
Crystal Palace, Bisham Abbey, Lilleshall, Holme Pierrepoint, Plas-y-Brenin
also provide stadiums, playing areas and leisure clubs.
Golf courses can be run by the council or privately owned
The provision of facilities is always based upon:
Location  is it in the right place? Can permission for it be obtained?
Scope  does the location and the size of the site enable the provision required? Can it be accessed easily?
Funding  can the funds be found to build it? Can they be sustained to keep it running?
Hosting a major event leaves locals with improved facilities
Hosting sports events can be very expensive but many cities and countries compete to be awarded the football World Cup, the Commonwealth Games, the Olympics and a number of other competitions.
There are pros and cons to this:
Advantages of hosting a major sporting event
Disadvantages of hosting a major sporting event

3960,"The worlds religions teach that God is good, and that God wants all people to enjoy a good life. Religious people believe that they have a responsibility to try to make the world a better, more equal place for everyone.
The world is a place where many people are poor and suffering, while there are some very rich people and institutions living more comfortable lives. People living in
often have a very low standard of living: they do not benefit from modern medical care, have few opportunities for education and little or no access to technology.
Religions teach that this is wrong; everyone should have the
opportunity to enjoy the wealth that Gods world has to offer
The First Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says:
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, the peoples of the United Nations have  determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.

1939,"Isambard Kingdom Brunel is one of the three main engineers responsible for the development of the railways. This Revision Bite will look at his contribution to the railway network.
The development of railways during the 19th century happened because of the work of three main engineers. We have already mentioned Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson, but Isambard Kingdom Brunel also played a key role.
who designed steam trains, oversaw the construction of new railway tracks and built some amazing and breathtaking bridges and tunnels along his railway routes.
the chief engineer of the Great Western Railway
(GWR) in 1833. The railway line linked the towns of London and Bristol and was often referred to as ""God's Wonderful Railway"" because the route was so smooth and it was a perfect example of railway engineering.
The line was so successful that it was later extended to connect to Plymouth and Cornwall. Brunel used his considerable skills on the route and
built the Tamar Bridge and Box Tunnel
One of the reasons why Brunel's railway routes and tracks were so smooth is because, unlike George Stephenson,
he used a gauge of 7 feet 3 inches
. He believed that this gauge was not only the safest, but would allow trains to travel faster and give the passengers more comfort. Unfortunately, 92 per cent of the railway tracks in Britain had already been built at Stephenson's gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches. This led to
the Gauge Act being passed in 1846
, which stated that all train tracks had to be built to George Stephenson's gauge width. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had
. This made it easier for trains to run on all tracks across the country and not just in the local area.

How information is passed through the nervous system
Neurons carry electrical signals, and are connected by synapses.
Neurons carry signals from one place to another, around the many parts of the nervous system. They connect sense receptors to the central nervous system and also connect one part of the nervous system to another, for example in the brain and spine. They also
from the nervous system to effector organs, such as muscles and glands.
When neurons are stimulated they transmit an

The central part of an atom. It contains protons and neutrons, and has most of the mass of the atom.
The living substance inside a cell (not including the nucleus).
. The cytoplasm forms a long fibre that is surrounded by a cell
. The axon carries the electrical impulse and is protected by a fatty sheath - a bit like the plastic coating around an electrical wire. The fatty sheath increases the speed at which the nerve impulse is transmitted. The nerve ending is branched to make good contact with other neurons or the effector organ.
Two neurons do not make direct contact. Where they meet, there is a very small gap called a
a tiny gap at the junction between two nerve cells which nerve signals must cross
. The signal needs to cross this gap to continue on its journey to, or from, the
Central Nervous System (brain and spinal cord).
. This is done by means of chemicals which
across the gap between the two neurons.

1949,"In your German exam you will have to show your reading skills. This exercise will help you understand an article where some students describe where they live.
Read these short descriptions, given by Claudia, Eva, Michael and Lars, of where they live. Don't worry if you don't understand every word at this stage.
Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.
fhrt in die Stadt abends, um sich zu unterhalten.
fhrt abends in die Stadt, um sich zu unterhalten.
Eva travels to town to go to the cinema.
Read the text through once, aiming to get a general sense of each paragraph. Don't worry if there are words that you don't understand - look for similarities with English words, for example:

3985,"People sometimes say that discrimination is created when prejudice is combined with power. Prejudice is the attitude of someone whose opinion is not based on fact. Prejudice can be triggered by differences of religion, race, colour, sex, language, disability or age. Prejudice is not illegal, as an attitude cant be illegal, but discrimination is illegal.
All forms of discrimination go against the first two Articles of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights:
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

211,"A 'tropism' is a growth in response to a stimulus. Plants grow towards sources of water and light, which they need to survive and grow.
Auxin is a plant hormone produced in the stem tips and roots, which controls the direction of growth. Plant hormones are used in weedkillers, rooting powder and to control fruit ripening.
to help make sure they grow towards sources of light and water.

 growth in response to the direction of
Responses of different parts of the plant
is a plant hormone responsible for controlling the
of root tips and stem tips in response to
of stems and roots. It's moved in solution to older parts of the stem and root where it changes the elasticity of the cells. More elastic cells absorb more water and grow longer, causing bending in the stem or root. It's thought that light and gravity can interfere with the transport of auxin causing it to be unevenly distributed.
3 groups of seeds are grown in a cardboard box.
- when the tips are removed, no auxin is made so the stems do not grow
 when the tips are covered, auxin moves to all parts of the stem causing all parts to grow

1209,"We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (tenths, hundredths, thousandths etc)
In the number 34.27, the value of the figure 2 is a tenth, and the value of the figure 7 is a hundredth.
When ordering numbers, we should always compare the digits on the left first.
For example, which is greater: 2.701 or 2.71?
Both numbers have two units and seven tenths, but 2.701 has no hundredths, whereas 2.71 has one hundredth. Therefore, 2.71 is greater than 2.701.
Another way to look at it is to write a zero at the end of 2.71 to make it 2.710 (this does not change its value, because it is after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.710 and 2.701. It is quite easy to see that 2.710 is bigger (just as 2710 is bigger than 2701).

Energy transfer for the generation of electricity from a fossil fuel
when they are burned. They are fossil fuels because they were

. Fossil fuels do not renew themselves, while fuels such as wood can be renewed endlessly.
, which adds to the greenhouse effect and increases global warming. Of the three fossil fuels, for a given amount of energy released, coal produces the most carbon dioxide and natural gas produces the least.
release sulfur dioxide gas when they burn
, which causes breathing problems for living creatures and contributes to acid rain.

are unstable. They break down and change into a completely different type of atom. This process is called
Over time, as the unstable atoms in a source of radiation change, the activity of the source goes down because there are fewer unstable atoms present to decay.
It is not possible to predict when an individual atom might decay, but you can measure how long it takes for half the atoms to decay. This is called the
There are two definitions of a half-life, but they mean essentially the same thing:
The time it takes for the number of atoms in a sample to halve.
The time it takes for the activity of a source of radiation to fall to half its starting level.
Different radioactive isotopes and types of radioactive material have different half-lives. For example, the half-life of
is nearly 6000 years, but the half-life of
It is possible to find out the half-life of a radioactive substance from a graph showing the count rate against time. The graph shows the
The decay curve for a radioactive substance
The count rate drops from 80 to 40 counts per minute in two days. So the half-life is two days. In the next two days, it drops from 40 to 20, ie it halves. In the two days after that, it drops from 20 to 10, ie it halves again, and so on.

For some background on Simon Armitage, look at the context section of

I've made out a will; I'm leaving myself
to the National Health. I'm sure they can use
the jellies and tubes and syrups and glues,
the web of nerves and veins, the loaf of brains,
and assortment of fillings and stitches and wounds,
blood - a gallon exactly of bilberry soup -
the chassis or cage or cathedral of bone;
but not the heart, they can leave that alone.
They can have the lot, the whole stock:
the loops and coils and sprockets and springs and rods,
the face, the case, the cogs and the hands,
leave that where it stops or hangs.
The poet announces that he's made a will and is leaving his body to the National Health Service - all except his heart. He lists many of the body parts that will be donated - described in terms of messy foodstuffs or parts of a clock - before stating firmly that he does not want his heart included (although the heart is perhaps the most valuable organ to the NHS, as it could be used for a transplant). He does not really explain this decision, beyond suggesting that his heart is what makes the mechanism go -
The poem is 14 lines long and is a

The poem has no title. It is from a collection called
: all the poems are untitled and are supposed to be read in the time it takes for a lighted match to burn down. The lack of a title means that even more weight is placed on the first words of the poem,
That first phrase is a clear statement. It shows that Armitage is so determined to see through his wish for his body to be used by the NHS that he has included it on a legal document.
The range of ways in which the body is described in lines 3 - 7 is humorous. For example, the phrase
(line 4) reminds us of the rhyming slang for head, 'loaf of bread' (people sometimes say 'Use your loaf'). Perhaps this suggests that Armitage is not too concerned about his body (except the heart). This is confirmed by the casual, offhand way in which he says

to underline his wish not to include the heart. The final couplet, like line 8, begins
(line 13) and the last line begins with an imperative verb, giving an order:
We are not told why Armitage wants to keep his heart. Perhaps it is because the heart is the one vital organ that keeps us alive and he does not want to lose it even in death. Or perhaps the choice of the

form gives us a clue: he values it for what the heart symbolises and for what we associate it with, like the sonnet - love.
Descriptions of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Things that represent other things.
to describe the parts of his body, all of them highly unscientific! He includes references to:
(line 7). This emphasises how 'ordinary' his body is.
(line5). This body is not perfect - it has been repaired as and where necessary and the scars still show.
the whole of the last six lines of the poem develop an extended metaphor of the heart being a clock. This is particularly effective since some parts of a clock are named after parts of the body -
(line 12) and the heart is often referred to in slang as a
, which Armitage capitalises on in line 13. The pendulum of a clock, like the heart in a body, is what keeps it going. If the pendulum stops, the clock stops; if the heart stops, you die.
Interestingly, Armitage cannot make up his mind which metaphor to use to describe the ribcage - it is
""the chassis or cage or cathedral of bone""

Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the
it expresses toward its subject matter. 'Attitude' can be thought of as a combination of the poet's
he or she is trying to get across to the reader.
A good way to decide on the
of a poem is to work out how you would read it aloud. Should the poem be read:
in a casual way, as if the poet didn't care about his body (except the heart)
with a romantic feel: the poet wants to preserve the part of him that represents love, perhaps to commemorate one special relationship.
in a morbid way, as if the poet is anticipating that he will die soon.
Most readers will probably feel that the

should be mainly jaunty and casual. However, with all that talk of body parts there has to be some morbidity in there too; and for most people there will be a little romanticism in the mix as well!

Armitage's attitude is ambiguous. It seems a very generous and selfless thing to leave his body to science, but the poem makes clear that he considers most of his body to be worthless - so how truly valuable is the gift he is making? Does he think the NHS deserves nothing better?
""They can have the lot, the whole stock ...""
Armitage's description of all the bits that make up his body as the stock of a clockmaker's shop again suggests that he doesn't value his body very highly.
Armitage compares his heart to a pendulum, the most important component of a clock - and therefore the most important part of his body. He is not going to be separated from it.
Since ancient times the heart has been thought of as the seat of passion and of love. Could this be why Armitage is so attached to his?
In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
All three poems are written in the first person, but I've made out a will seems to be Armitage's own voice, while in the other two he adopts a
The speaker of a poem; a fictional character in a drama; a mask someone presents to the world (it is the Latin word for an actor's mask).
Duffy's poem is personal. Like Armitage's poem, it contains her own thoughts.
The 'I' or 'we' used by a narrator who is a participant in a narrative, in contrast to the third person 'he', 'she' or 'they' of a narrator who is not directly involved.
, but here Yeats adopts the persona of an old woman; he is not writing about himself..
A 14-line poem, usually written in iambic pentameter. Most sonnets conform to one of the following rhyme schemes: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG (English sonnet); or ABBA ABBA CDE CDE (Italian sonnet).
form and both write from their own point of view. Clare's poem is less obscure than Armitage's.
In the exam you'll be asked to write about four poems, two pre-1914 and two post-1914 (Heaney and Clarke or Duffy and Armitage), comparing and contrasting them with each other.
The poems will usually have something in common - such as their subject matter, or an aspect of their language, or the ideas expressed - but also important differences. In comparing them, you may be able to notice things about the way the poems convey their meanings which you might not have noticed before.
When you are asked to compare poems, it's a good idea to run through in your mind each of the headings under which we have looked at the poems in the revision bite:
subject matter, structure, language and imagery, sound, ideas and attitudes and tone.
Compare I've made out a will.. with one other post-1914 poem and two pre-1914 poems of your choice that are written in sonnet form. Why do you think the poets decided on this form for these poems?
Three poems suitable for this comparison would be Duffy's Anne Hathaway, Jonson's On my first Sonne, and Whitman's Patrolling Barnegat.
What would you want to include in your comparison? On a piece of paper, note down some points to make in comparing I've made out a will with each of these three poems.
I've made out a will: Test (answer hints)
Compare your answer with the hints below:
The sonnet's short length and tight structure make it suitable for intimate thoughts, single, simple ideas, and extended metaphors. Traditionally it has often been used for epitaphs - ie, reflections on what persists after a person's death.
These poems contain extended metaphors - one describing the body in terms of food or a clock, the other describing the couple's relationship in terms of a bed.
Both poems are quite intimate: one describes the writer's attitude towards his own body parts, the other Anne Hathaway's memories of love-making with her remarkable husband.
Both poems focus on one all-important thing that is seen as persisting, despite death: Armitage's heart, - his 'pendulum, the ticker' - and Anne Hathaway's 'living, laughing love - I hold him in the casket of my widow's head'.
Sonnets have traditionally been used to express intimate, personal feelings and thoughts about big subjects like love and death. They often make heavy use of metaphor.
Both these poems talk about death - about what goes and what might live on in some way. Both poems could be seen as a kind of epitaph.
The Armitage sonnet uses a series of metaphors of the body as food, or a clock. The Jonson sonnet has two metaphors: that of the debt - 'Seven years tho'wert lent to me, and I thee pay' - and the child as a poem - 'Ben Jonson his best piece of poetrie'.
The mood of the two poems is very different: one looking humourously forward to the writer's own death, the other looking back at someone else's death with grief and a kind of resignation.
Sonnets are compact, tightly structured poems. They are ideal for describing a single scene or idea, or capturing a moment of intense feeling.
These poems both do just that. Armitage's expresses the kind of wry thought that might strike you while you sit in a hospital waiting room; Whitman's describes a momentary wild thought while walking in a storm
Both poems are densely descriptive, with images tumbling confusedly over each other.
Both sonnets are fairly free: Whitman's poem has 6 beats/line instead of the usual 5, and a single half-rhyme echoing through the whole poem. Armitage's uses a mixture of 4 or 5 beats/line and rhymes erratically. They also both also seem to tail off at the end with extra short lines.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

3768,"The assessment objectives can be completed in any order, as each person's creative journey will vary. This list will help you cover all four assessment objectives.
Look at magazines, books and the internet.
Cut out interesting images from magazines and newspapers.
Write notes about your work. - Explain what's going on in your head, and describe your initial thoughts.
Decide what's important and worth continuing with. What works, what doesn't?
Can you make links? - Look carefully at what you're drawing - are there links with what others have done?
What are you looking at, and what does it mean?
Explain your thoughts in detailed notes and further drawings.
Look at how your particular idea has been approached by different cultures. - Visit local museums and art galleries.
Collect thumbnail images and postcards.- Compare your own work with the work of others.
Start to develop your ideas and work.
Experiment with the size or colour of your work.
Write down your thoughts and explain the processes.
Do you know what you're doing in your final exam?
Make a small model of it, or paint a rough version.
Don't do an exact copy of it, but do resolve any problems - then you'll use the ten-hour exam time well.

2429,"The way electrons are arranged in an atom is called the
. As you have seen on the previous page, there is a link between an element's electronic structure and its place in the Periodic Table.
You can work out an element's electronic structure from its place in the Periodic Table
The diagram below shows a section of the Periodic Table, with the elements arranged as usual in order of their atomic number from 2 to 20. The red numbers above each chemical symbol show the electrons in each shell.
Electron arrangement for a section of the periodic table
the number of shells is the same as the period number.
As you go across each period from left to right the outer shell gradually becomes filled with electrons. The outer shell contains just one electron on the left hand side of the table, but is filled by the time you get to the right hand side.
the number of electrons in the outermost shell is the same as the group number.
Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its outer shell.
to this rule, since although it comes after Group 7 it is not called 'Group 8'; and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.
Working out electronic structure from the Periodic Table
Here's how to use the Periodic Table to work out an electronic structure:
Find the element in the Periodic Table. Work out which period it's in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.
Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements (except helium).
Fill the other circles with electrons (remember: two in the first, eight in the second and third, 18 in the fourth).
Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.
Working out electronic structure from the atomic number
of an atom is the number of
it has. This is the same as the number of electrons. If we know the atomic number we can work out the arrangement of the electrons.
Fill the shells starting from the smallest and going outward.
For example silicon has atomic number 16. So we have to fill the shells with 16 electrons. That makes 2 in the first (to fill it), 8 in the second shell (to fill that) and 6 left to go into the third shell. So silicon has electronic structure 2.8.6

Click 'Next' for some background information on this artist.
Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows.
She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997.
'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part.
Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements.
Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it.
My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions.
I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.

3815,"Compare your answer with the hints below:
Both poems are about a harvest - yet in both, something happens to sour the happy atmosphere.
IClarke uses the mouse as a symbol of the weak and vulnerable in the world who are the innocent victims of warfare, while Heaney's poem shows the contrast between hope and disappointment. (His disappointment with the wasted blackberries reflects other disappointments in life.)
In both poems, the narrative is reflected in the structure - stanza 1 of Heaney's poem is about hope, stanza 2 is about disappointment.
Out in the storm, Whitman reflects on the violence of the natural world; Clarke is awakened to violence committed by man. However, both have nightmarish qualities.
Both are in the present tense, to add to the tension. Whitman's poem is a sonnet. The last syllable of each line rhymes, creating a dramatic effect. Clarke's is freer in form and sounds more like natural speech.
Clare's poem is very celebratory and innocent. There is no violence in the natural world he describes
...because there are no humans to cause it, unlike in Clarke's poem.
Again, both poems are from personal experience.
Both are about high summer: Clare refers to the hay grass, but it is for him something beautiful to look at rather than something with a purpose.
Like Whitman's, Clare's poem is a sonnet. We often associate sonnets with love, so perhaps his poem is simple an expression of his love of nature.
Of course, these suggestions do not contain everything there is to say! You may have thought of other relevant points, and there may be other poems you have read which you could use in your comparison. The important thing is to be able to write two or three sentences pointing out similarities and differences between the poems.

Sub-atomic particles, with a negative charge and a negligible mass relative to protons and neutrons.
are formed. Ions can be either positively or negatively charged.
For the Higher Tier, you need to know which ions are produced by acids, and which are produced by alkalis. You will also need to know the ionic equation for
Neutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt plus water.
When acids dissolve in water they produce hydrogen ions, H
. For example, looking at hydrochloric acid:
Remember that (aq) means the substance is in solution.
When alkalis dissolve in water they produce hydroxide ions, OH
. For example, looking at sodium hydroxide:
Ammonia is slightly different. This is the equation for ammonia in solution:
ions from an acid react with the OH
ions from an alkali, a neutralisation reaction occurs to form water. This is the equation for the reaction:
If you look at the equations above for sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, you will see that there are Na

7149,"When the boys first gather on the island they appear a very varied group, yet by the end they all seem very similar. So, what happens to them to cause this transformation?
Let's look at the most important characters in more detail. If you've time, jot down the key points you've noticed about the characters featured here - then compare your notes with ours.
""You could see he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness in the shoulders went, but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil.""
""there was a stillness about Ralph as he sat that marked him out: there was his size and attractive appearance""
He is twelve years and a few months old. He has an attractive appearance, which suggests that he has an attractive character too.
He is sensible: it was Ralph's idea to have a chief, establish rules and build a signal fire so they can be rescued. He speaks wisely.
He is a good leader. He knows that it's important to keep Jack on his side and speaks to Piggy with the directness of genuine leadership. Later on he feels the weight of being chief as a personal hell - but he doesn't give up.
He wants to hang on to civilised values. When he realises that their lives are full of dirt and decay, he feels a
. In the discussions about the beast, he feels
""the understandable and lawful world... slipping away""
He uses civilised language. Even when he is pleading with Jack for the return of Piggy's glasses, he speaks like a school boy:
He is brave. He led the search for the beast at the fort alone:
It is Ralph who approaches the dead airman at the top of the mountain, with leaden steps, while Jack and Roger stay back.
Yet even Ralph sometimes gets carried away with the hunt. Ralph starts the game where they pretend Robert is a pig:
""The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering""
. Later on, he becomes part of the 'dance' that kills Simon. Near the end, he breaks the pig's skull on the stick with a sick fear and rage.
Ralph finally becomes an outcast. He tells himself this is
When he meets the naval officer, he is seen as a little scarecrow, but Ralph is still able to assert himself as the leader. Then he cries, for the first time on the island.

1912,"You should remember from your Key Stage 3 studies that white light can be split up into a spectrum of many different colours. You should know that visible light is just part of a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.
White light can be split up to form a spectrum using a

of the light the more it is
There is refraction when waves change direction as they move from one transparent substance to another.
. As a result, red light is refracted the least and violet light is refracted the most, causing the coloured light to spread out to form a spectrum.
Visible light is just one type of
. There are various types of electromagnetic radiation with longer wavelengths of light than red light and with shorter wavelengths than violet light. All the different types of electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through the vacuum of empty space.
You should know the different types of
The table summarises the main types of electromagnetic radiation and a typical use for each of them.
Unlike sound waves, electromagnetic waves do not need a substance to travel through. They can travel through the
of empty space. In a vacuum, they all travel with the same very high speed: 300 000 000 m/s.
A beam of electromagnetic radiation delivers energy in packets called photons.
The energy delivered by each photon increases with the
of the electromagnetic waves. This means that gamma photons have the most energy, and radio photons the least.
of a beam of electromagnetic radiation is the energy it delivers to a surface each second. This depends on how much energy each photon delivers, and on how many photons per second arrive at that surface.
Different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are used for different purposes due to their varying characteristics in reflection, absorption and transmission by various materials.
. X-rays mostly pass through skin and soft tissue, but they do not easily pass through bone or metal. X-rays are used to produce shadow photographs of bones to check for damage such as fractures. They are also used in industry to check metal components and welds for cracks or other damage, and can detect objects hidden in the luggage of aircraft passengers.
Even low doses of X-rays can cause cells to become cancerous, so precautions are taken in hospitals to limit the dose received by patients and staff when X-ray photographs are taken.
Because these can travel long distances through glass without becoming significantly weaker, these are used in

Microwave radiation has lower frequencies and longer

than visible light. Microwaves with certain wavelengths are absorbed by water molecules and can be used for
. Water in the food absorbs the microwave radiation, which causes the water to heat up and cook the food. The water in living cells can also absorb microwave radiation. As a result, they can be killed or damaged by the heat released.

Microwave radiation can also be used to
such as mobile phone calls. Microwave transmitters and receivers on buildings and masts communicate with the mobile telephones in their range.
Certain microwave radiation wavelengths pass through the Earth's atmosphere and can be used to transmit information to and from
microwaves well. For this reason, satellite dishes are made from metal, and so are the cases of microwave ovens.

3215,"The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer
. When you connect your computer to the Internet via your Internet Service Provider (ISP) you become part of the ISPs network, which is connected to other networks that make up the Internet.
(WWW or Web for short) is the part of the Internet that you can access using a
an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages
. It consists of a large number of web servers that host websites. Each website will normally consist of a number of web pages. A web page can contain text, images, video, animation and sound.
You can access a website or web page by typing its URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar of your browser. An example of a URL is
a request/response standard, web browsers send requests and websites or servers respond to requests
an area of control or management, eg bbc.co.uk is controlled by the BBC
the Internet country code for the United Kingdom
). What goes in between is arbitrary, but often has the term ""www"", eg http://
.bbc.co.uk, but it doesnt have to, eg http://
is the secure version of http. When you use https any
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
you send or receive from the web server is encrypted. For example, when banking online https is used to keep your account details safe.
Most sites have a page that links the user to the other main areas of the site. This is called the homepage.
Web pages are connected by hypertext links. When a link is clicked you will be taken to another page which could be on another
a computer that provides services to users, eg access to shared files, web hosting, file storage
An intranet is a network that works like the Internet but is only available within a particular organisation, not to the public. An intranet may have web pages used to share company specific data within that company, such as internal telephone numbers or details of employee benefits.

The poem seems to be spoken by a BBC newsreader.
He or she explains why the BBC thinks it is important to read the news in a 'BBC accent': no one will take the news seriously if it's read with a 'voice lik/wanna yoo/scruff'.
He or she speaks here in the accent of an ordinary speaker/viewer - just the kind of voice the newsreader is rejecting.
A newsreader would never really reveal his or her prejudices directly to the viewer in this way. So what the newsreader 'says' in this poem perhaps needs to be seen as the unspoken message (or
) of the way the news is presented.
Formal, official, 'book-English'. The opposite of dialect or slang.
. Would it carry the same 'trooth'?

1028,"A storyboard shows each stage you want to have on screen, one after the other. You would normally use a storyboard if there is just a single pathway through your product  for example, a simple slideshow that starts at Slide 1 and goes through to the end.
You can include pictures, text and descriptions to explain what you are trying to achieve. For example, you might want to describe some sound or music that you want to have, or the transition you would like to have between slides.
Below is an example of a storyboard for a School Parents' Evening presentation.
The more detail you include, the easier you will find it when you come to make the actual product.
Your finished version does not have to be exactly the same as your original design:
Sometimes you will find better ways of doing something. For example, you may not be able to find the precise image you intended to use.
Don't worry about changes. The storyboard is just a plan to guide you through the process. You will not lose marks for changes.
Use your evaluation section to explain the differences between the storyboard plan and final version. Don't forget to include reasons why changes were made.

6661,"This Revision Bite will give you practice in creating and structuring a presentation about a famous person in five key sections: introduction, past, present, future and concluding opinion.
In your presentation exam you should speak for about one minute in Irish on a topic you have prepared, then you will be asked questions in Irish about what you have said. You are usually allowed to take a prompt card into the exam with you with five brief points on it and as many pictures as you like, to help you remember what to say.
A good way to structure your presentation so you include a variety of tenses plus an opinion is to start with
('tomorrow' - the future), before finishing off with
For his presentation Samus has written five paragraphs about Peter Canavan, but the order of the paragraphs has been jumbled up. Can you work out which paragraph is the introduction, which is about Peter Canavan's past, present and future, and which is the concluding opinion? It will help you to look out for uses of different tenses.

You could summarise the presentation under the following five headings:
- sport and especially Gaelic football; favourite player (Peter Canavan); description (age, appearance, home, marital status, children, etc.).
- All-Ireland Final last year against Armagh; Tyrone won and Peter was captain; how he played and what he scored; Sam Maguire and celebrations.
- very fit and he loves Gaelic football; Errigal Ciaran and Tyrone; very good footballer - skillful and dedicated; training every day.
- P.E. teacher in a secondary school in Co. Tyrone; may not be teaching this year because of work with football; he may not play for Tyrone next year because he may be too old.
- excellent footballer; I was so happy when he lifted Sam Maguire; Come on Tyrone!
In the exam the prompt card can usually have five bullet points of what you want to say. These bullet points can be in Irish. You can prepare the card well in advance of the exam so make sure you check vocabulary, gender and pronunciation thoroughly. If in doubt ask your teacher.

This is a very good presentation. Samus has included lots of information about his chosen famous person and has used the past, present and future tenses effectively. He has introduced his topic well with detailed background information and has used structures and vocabulary already known to him from his description of himself. He has also chosen a topic which he is genuinely interested in, therefore making it easier for himself to adopt an enthusiastic approach to the subject. He has concluded by offering a range of opinions, all of which he has explained and for which he has given reasons. His presentation has a clear start, middle and end and offers the listener a well-structured presentation on his chosen topic.

In this presentation I will be talking about Peter Canavan. Peter Canavan is thirty-three years of age. He is fairly small and thin but he is very strong. His hair is short and his eyes are blue. He lives in Ballygawley in County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. He is married and he has three children.
He is a very fit person and he has a big interest in Gaelic football. He plays Gaelic football for the Errigal Ciaran team and for the Tyrone team. He is a very good footballer. He is very skillful and dedicated. He trains every day and he is getting better.
He played in the Final last year against Armagh and Tyrone won. Peter Canavan was extremely happy that day. He played quite well that day and he got a couple of points. After the match he lifted Sam Maguire and he was very happy. He brought Sam Maguire back to Tyrone and he had a big party.
He is a P.E. teacher also. He teaches in a secondary school in County Tyrone. He will not be teaching this year, however, because he has a lot of work with the football. It is possible that he will not be playing football next year. He thinks that he will retire from football because he will be too old.
I think that he is an excellent footballer and I was very happy when he lifted Sam Maguire. Come on Tyrone!
After your presentation you will have to answer questions on it. Think about the kinds of questions you could be asked on this topic and prepare answers to them.
You are usually allowed to take a card in with you with five reminders of what you want to say. These should not be in complete sentences but might contain, for example, headings for each part of your talk or unusual words which you need.
Remember to learn the vocabulary you need to describe other people (especially famous people, sports stars and musicians), including how to talk about special features and aspects of their lives and careers. Make sure you can explain why you chose this topic and why you are interested in it.

7504,"Rod shaped bodies found in the nucleus of cells that contain genetic information (DNA).
The basic units of genetic material inherited from our parents. A gene is a section of DNA which controls part of a cell's chemistry - particularly protein production.
in the same places. But there are different versions of the same gene.
Different versions of the same gene are called
, which is pronounced al-eels. For example, the gene for eye colour has an allele for blue eye colour and an allele for brown. For any gene, a person may have the same two alleles, or two different ones.
Alleles may be either recessive or dominant.
allele only shows if the individual has two copies of it. For example, the allele for blue eyes is recessive. You need two copies of this allele to have blue eyes.
allele always shows, even if the individual only has one copy of it. For example, the allele for brown eyes is dominant. You only need one copy of it to have brown eyes. Two copies will still give you brown eyes.
Individuals A and B have brown eyes - only individual C has blue eyes
Only individual C will have blue eyes, because the allele for blue eyes is recessive.

1440,"When answering a source based question, it is important to pick apart the source and study every detail to see what it suggests.
For Source B, you must be able to identify which people in the source are the Chartists and which ones are the government. You must also ask questions:
These are the Chartists  most of them are carrying pikes but at least one of them has a gun.
These figures are the government  you can tell this by the top hats that they are wearing. They are holding guns.

1568,"There are four main stages in setting up a new computer system: Analysis - studying the problem; design - designing a solution; implementation - putting the solution into effect and testing it; evaluation - checking that the solution is working as intended. This process is often called systems analysis.
Developing and activating a new computer system is a long process. It is important to break the process down into smaller stages, each one requiring a different set of professional skills.
An important part of this process is the first stage -
. During this stage the systems analyst will investigate how the current system works and what needs to be improved. This involves finding out whether a new computer system is needed at all and exactly what it will be used for.
Analysis is all about looking at how a job is done at present and seeing if the job could be done better or more efficiently by upgrading or developing a new system.
With this goal in mind, the systems analyst might:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
and any printouts the current system creates
Having investigated the present system, the systems analyst will produce a
. This will look at whether the new system is:
- is the new system technically possible to implement in the time available?
- will the cost of the new system be offset by savings once it is implemented, ie will it save the organisation time, money or increase its performance?
The project will only continue to the next stage if the answer to both of these questions is yes. At this point the decision makers in the organisation, eg the board of directors, decide whether or not to go ahead.
The next step is to draw up a
that outlines exactly what the new system will do. For example, it will mention:
a general term used to describe an application or a program
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
A test plan will be included in the design phase to explain exactly how the new system will be tested and the expected outcomes for each test.
a general term used to describe an application or a program
is usually very complex. Any mistakes made by the designers or programmer can have a dramatic effect depending on what the software is used for.
Usually software is tested with three distinct types of
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
 this is normal data the system should be working with.
 this is data at the boundary between typical data and invalid data.
Invalid data (sometimes known as erroneous data)
 this is data that should cause the system to tell the user that there is a problem with data entered into the system.
Testing helps to ensure that the system always acts as expected.
Implementation is the next stage of developing a new system, after design. This is where the new system is created and installed.
a list of instructions written in a programming language
a general term used to describe an application or a program
a resource - for example, a collection of documents containing all the information a user needs to know about using and getting support with a piece of software
testing the system using the test plan
If the tests are not satisfactory then any problems will need to be corrected and the system tested again.
User documentation will be written to help staff become familiar with the new system. It will include:
a step by step guide, eg a guide to using a piece of software including instructions, example scenarios and screenshots
the term denoting either an entrance or changes which are inserted into a system and which activate/modify a process
the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process
taking a screen shot of what's displayed on screen and saving it in an image file, eg as a *.jpg, *.bmp or *.gif
details of what error messages mean, ie troubleshooting advice
When the system is ready to go on-line there are different ways of moving from the old to the new system:
Running both the old and new system until you are certain the new system is working correctly. Parallel running is likely to be the most expensive as it involves doing the work twice for a period of time. However, it is the safest. If there are any bugs in the new system, you can always go back to the old system while the problems are corrected.
Changing over in a small part of the company to start with. Only when the system is deemed satisfactory will it be rolled out to the rest of the organisation. A supermarket introducing a new 'self-scanning' system might choose to introduce it in two or three stores at first. This is a pilot changeover.
The old system is scrapped and immediately replaced by the new system. With this option there is a danger that there may still be problems with the new system. Even though it is the most risky type of changeover, many companies use this method.
The change over is split into phases or stages. Each stage is introduced one at a time and the old system is kept running to do the remainder of the tasks that have not yet been changed.
Once the system has been installed it will be monitored to check whether it is working correctly. Sometimes problems with a system will not be found until it is being used by a large number of people or an unusual situation occurs.
Evaluation is really re-analysing - starting the same systems analysis process all over again. Many of the same techniques can be used, such as interviewing staff or sending out questionnaires.
Once a system is running correctly it can still need maintenance. This may be because a bug is found or because the company needs a new feature.

7420,"In November 1923, Hitler tried to take advantage of the crisis facing the Weimar government by instigating a
in Munich. It seemed like the perfect opportunity, but poor planning and misjudgement resulted in failure and the subsequent imprisonment of Adolf Hitler.

(the SA), which attacked other political groups. Hitler hoped to take power by starting a
A complete or radical change. In political terms, revolution involves a radical change in government.
During the crisis of 1923, therefore, Hitler plotted with two nationalist politicians -
- to take over Munich in a revolution.
Hitler is angered as Kahr and Lossow call off the rebellion
Hitler collected his storm troopers and told them to be ready to rebel.
Kahr and Lossow called off the rebellion
. This was an impossible situation for Hitler, who had 3,000 troops ready to fight.
Hitler waved a gun at Khar and Lossow
On the night of 8 November 1923, Hitler and 600 storm troopers burst into a meeting that Kahr and Lossow were holding at the local
. Waving a gun at them, Hitler forced them to agree to rebel - and then let them go home. The SA took over the army headquarters and the offices of the local newspaper.
16 Nazis were killed in the scuffle
The next day, 9 November 1923, Hitler and his Nazis went into Munich on what they thought would be a triumphal march to take power.
However, Kahr had called in police and army reinforcements. There was a short scuffle in which the police killed 16 Nazis.

2537,"If you have a balanced equation for a reaction, you can calculate the masses of
substances present at the start of a chemical reaction
A product is a substance formed in a chemical reaction.
(s)    CaO(s) + CO
, how much CaO can we make?
is 40 + 12 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 100
of CaO is 40 + 16 = 56
would yield 56g of CaO in this reaction. In the question we are told we have only half of that amount of CaCO
, 50g. So we will get half the amount of CaO, 28g.
mass of CaO we can make = 28g
Notice in this that 22g of CO

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.

Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

3753,"The arrival of the railway network had a huge impact on Britain. The railways gave people the ability to travel around the country quickly and made different areas more accessible.
The railways brought social, political and economic changes.
Once railways were established as Britain's newest and fastest communication and transport system, they started to have a number of effects on Britain. These effects can be put into three main categories:
- people becoming more aware of political movements and national news.
- improving the financial side of Britain.
Within 40 years, the arrival of trains had made a big impact on Britain and some of these changes can still be seen today.
The rail construction industry created new jobs

346,"Are you a chatterbox or a master speaker? Note down your answer to these questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of speaker you are.
1. Your group is giving a presentation on a character in the book you've been reading as a class. Do you:
a) Make it up as you go along, forget what you've already said and start to laugh.
b) Spend all your time making a massive poster of the character.
c) Plan what you're going to say, and speak loudly and clearly, even though you feel nervous.
2. Your teacher asks you to read aloud in class. Do you:
a) Read the extract really quickly to get it done as soon as possible.
b) Read the extract and look up at the end when you've finished.
c) Read the extract in a slow and clear manner using emotion and pauses where appropriate.
3. You've written a really good speech and the time has come for you to present it to the class. Do you:
a) Wonder, at the last minute, if you look a bit of a geek, and read out the speech as if it was your granny's shopping list.
b) Hide in the toilet and hope that you'll get good marks for writing the speech even if you don't present it.
c) Try to act out the speech as if it were a piece of drama. You feel a bit nervous, but you want people to know how passionate you are about the subject.
4. During informal class discussions, you usually:
a) Talk as much as possible. Sometimes, even when other people are talking.
b) Keep quiet and let others do the talking.
c) Think about what you want to say before you speak, having listened to other people's ideas.
5. In a class debate, you are put on the team that opposes the motion, 'Meat is Murder', but you are a vegetarian! Do you:
a) Read out the speech that your team has helped you prepare, but lose interest for the rest of the debate.
b) Refuse to take part and say nothing.
c) Use your knowledge as a vegetarian to guess what the proposing team's points might be, so that you can help your team to knock those arguments down and win the debate.
You probably are a good speaker, but you haven't polished your skills yet. Deep down, you'd like people to take you seriously. Well, here's your chance!
You hate speaking and listening assessments and think you're going to die every time the teacher says you've got to do one. What you need to remember is that everyone feels just as nervous as you do. They're all just better at pretending.
You are a great speaker. It's not easy, but you take part and overcome your nerves

525,"> Electric current and voltage - Circuit symbols
Electric current and voltage - Circuit symbols
We use circuit symbols to draw diagrams of electrical circuits, with straight lines to show the wires. The diagram shows some common circuit symbols.
Notice the difference between the symbol for a
? The battery is made from joining cell symbols together.
Think of what we usually call a single battery, like the type you put in a torch. In physics, each of these is actually called a
- it is only when you have two or more of these cells connected together that you call it a battery.
The idea of a circuit diagram is to use circuit symbols instead of drawing each component in the circuit. Always try to make the wires
lines, and don't be tempted to make them wiggly.
The whole point is to make it easier to see what is connected to what. Here you can see how the symbols for a cell (not a battery!) and a lamp look in a circuit diagram.
If you have to draw a circuit diagram from scratch, it is usually easier to draw the circuit symbols first, and then add all the wires. If you have to draw wires to join circuit symbols that are already shown, use a ruler and don't let the wires cross each other.

353,"The commonly used metric units of length include:
To find a suitable unit to measure something in, you should first estimate how big it is. So, for example, do you think it's better to measure the distance between London and Manchester in metres or kilometres? Or, should an insect be measured in metres or millimetres?
Imagine the length of the objects you are estimating or imagine measuring them in relation to other objects. For example:
Imagine a metre ruler next to a tall man. You would expect him to be taller than 1 ruler, but not as tall as 3 rulers.
Imagine a bag of sugar on some scales. You would expect the needle to move round a little, but not to whizz round to 50kg.
Imagine a 1-litre bottle of cola. You would expect it to hold approximately the same amount as a large flask.
Q1. Which unit of measurement (km, m, cm or mm) would you use for the following?
b) the length of a football pitch
d) the distance from London to Manchester
a) Is the height of a tall man likely to be 90cm, 180cm or 360cm?
b) Is the weight of a bag of sugar about 1kg, 10kg or 50kg?
c) Does a large flask hold roughly 200ml, 1l or 10l of liquid?

Variation and classification - Variety within a species
Within a population of animals, plants or any living organisms, there will be
. Within each species the individuals with the variations best suited to the environment will survive better than the others. More of them will survive to reproduce than the others. When they do, they pass on the genetic information for these variations to their offspring.
Species gradually evolve in this way. This process is called
Over time a population can change so much it may even become a new species, unable to reproduce successfully with individuals of the original species.
to produce new varieties of a species. A variety is a type of a particular species that is different in some clear way from other varieties of that species.
For example, pedigree dogs come in lots of different varieties, called breeds of dog. They may be different colours and sizes, but they are all still dogs. They are all still the same species. Different varieties of dog have been produced by selective breeding.
Suppose you wanted a variety of cow that produced a lot of milk. This is what you could do:
choose or select the cows in your herd that produce the most milk
select the offspring that produce the most milk
keep repeating the process of selection and breeding until you achieve your goal.
The key here is to identify the feature you want, and only breed from the individuals that have that feature. Here are some examples of what selective breeding can produce:
hens that lay big eggs of a particular colour
tomato plants that produce lots of tomatoes

254,"> Whole numbers - Writing and describing
When describing whole numbers, remember the place values of the original digits.
However, some digits are 'joined' in their description. For example - when describing the number 35, we do not say 'three tens and five units', but instead describe it by the more common name of 'thirty five'.
In the same way the thousands, ten-thousands and hundred-thousands columns are usually described together. Here are some examples.
2 000 is described as 'two thousand'
62 000 is described as 'sixty two thousand', and
162 000 is described as 'one hundred and sixty-two thousand'
The number 3 147 286 can be written in words as
three million, one hundred and forty seven thousand, two hundred and eighty six.
Q1. Describe the numbers 4 235 225 in words.
Q2. Write twenty-three thousand and fifty six in figures
A1. Four million, two hundred and thirty five thousand, two hundred and twenty five.

Energy transfer and storage - Energy transfer diagrams
Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of
. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below.
We can show the transfers like this:
the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the
energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms.
But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by
. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this:
Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light:
Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not.

When we divide by 10, every figure moves
place to the right. Thousands become hundreds, hundreds become tens and tens become units.
When we divide by 100, every figure moves
places to the right. Thousands become tens, hundreds become units, and tens and units become fractions of a unit.
When we divide by 1000, every figure moves
places to the right. Thousands become units. Hundreds, tens and units become fractions of a unit.

11,"> The Tempest Summary - The banquet
Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears Ferdinand and Miranda say they love each other. He finally approves of their love.
On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music.
In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done.
A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage.
Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate.
Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano in a smelly pool
Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs.
Prospero is pleased with Ariel, and promises he'll soon be free.

319,"Something that is implicit is inferred - it is suggested, but not actually said. Implicit meaning can be a little harder to find than explicit meaning. Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life.
The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following:
Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk.
He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside,
he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat
. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said.
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk.
,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had
a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm
, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""
On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to
about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors.
Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully?
When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a
man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort.
We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful.
So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!

433,"You may get told off if you swing around on one leg of a chair instead of sitting properly. Apart from the risk that you will damage the chair or hurt yourself, the chair leg can damage the floor. This is because it puts too much
To work out pressure, we need to know two things:
the area over which the force or weight works.
This is the equation for working out pressure:
A force of 20 N acted over an area of 2 m
(two square metres). What is the pressure?
Notice that the unit of pressure here is N/m
(newtons per square metre). Sometimes you will see another unit being used. This is called the
, so in the example above the pressure is 10 Pa.
Drawing pins make good use of pressure
Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board.
If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.

You already know that the size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor.
For example, a scale factor of 2 means that the new shape is twice the size of the original. A scale factor of 3 means that the new shape is three times the size of the original.
It therefore follows that a scale factor of
To enlarge the triangle with a scale factor of
and centre of enlargement 0, do the following:
Enlarging a triangle with a scale factor of one half
What is the scale factor of enlargement in this diagram?
Remember that OA is 6 units and OA' is 2 units.
BC is 3 units and B'C' is 1 unit, so each side on the image is
of the length of the original shape.
Always check which is the object and which is the image, so that you don't confuse the scale factors. For example, a scale factor of 2 might be mistaken for a scale factor of
, or a scale factor of 3 mistaken for a scale factor of

65,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Graphs
As well as solving simultaneous equations algebraically, you can solve them by rearranging them into the form of y = mx+c so that you can plot as straight line graphs. When you have plotted the graphs, you can work out the values of x and y that solve the equations.
To refresh your knowledge of straight line graphs, look at
Use the graphical method to solve the simultaneous equations:
Start by rearranging the two equations to get them in the form:
In this case you only need to rearrange the second equation. The two equations are now:
We now have two equations of straight-line graphs, which we can plot.
When we do this we can look at where the two lines cross (the point of
). The values of x and y at this point are the solutions of the simultaneous equations.
The solution of this pair of simultaneous equations is
x = 2 and y = 4

544,"> Representing data - Constructing pie charts
To construct a pie chart you need to work out the fraction of the total that the sector represents. You can then convert this to an angle and draw the sector on the chart.
Constructing pie charts - using a table
The table below shows the grades achieved by 30 pupils in their end-of-year exam.
To show this information in a pie chart, take the following steps:
Work out the total number of pupils
: 7 + 11 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30
To work out the angle of each segment,
work out the fraction of the total that got each grade
There are 360 in a full turn, so to work out the angle,
The grade A sector has an angle of 84
Repeat this process to find the angle of the segments for the other grades
Once you have calculated the angles of the segments, construct the pie chart
Copy and complete the following table, then use the data to construct a pie chart.

Collecting and recording data - Stem and leaf diagrams
A stem and leaf diagram is one way of grouping your data into classes and
A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below:
This is all the information you need, but it is very hard to interpret. For example, is it easy to tell whether more children got marks in the 20s than the 30s? Can you tell at a glance what the highest mark was, or whether more than one person achieved the same result?
One way to represent the data so that you can answer these questions is in a
. This diagram shows exactly the same results as in the example above:
The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case tens and units.
This information is given in the Key.
The numbers are usually ordered, so the row:
shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25, and 27 in order.
Using the stem and leaf diagram above, answer the following questions.
Q2. What was the most common score?
A1. You can work this out by looking at the 3 column in the 10s:
A2. You can work this out from the stem and leaf diagram below:

Inform, explain and describe - The differences
, the writing tends to stick to facts - things you know about and things that can be checked elsewhere.
, the writing tends to be about facts and reasons, so you'd write about why or how something happened.
, it's like taking a photo of something - you need information, but also lots of interesting details. You can include your own thoughts and feelings as well, because that helps convey information to your audience.
So really, the ideas and topics you can write about are almost the same. It doesn't matter which of the three styles you are doing, you basically want to give information to your readers. What makes the difference is how you go about it.

391,"> Forces - Weight, mass and gravity
People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg).
The mass of an object is the
or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in
A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is.
All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called
. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong.
Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth.
""Down"" is towards the centre of the Earth, wherever you are on the planet
Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the
between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be.
Weight is a force, so it's measured in
. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N.
The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon.
The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth.
The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's
The weight of an object changes if the strength of gravity changes
Remember: a mass of 1kg has a weight of about 10N on Earth.

The Tempest second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda,
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.
even if her father is cruel and grumpy.
Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play!
Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance.
On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance?
Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent.
but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him.
In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal.
He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him.
Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point.
Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand.
Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
, but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand.
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!
but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part.
Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.
Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble.

It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love.
Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love
Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past.
Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way?
In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count).
Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda.
Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all.
Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time!

267,"> Food chains - Respiration in plants
All living things get the energy they need to live from a chemical reaction called
. This process needs glucose as a starting point. First we'll see how respiration works, and then look at how plants use respiration in combination with photosynthesis.
is the chemical reaction used to release energy from glucose. It is called aerobic because oxygen from the air is also needed.
Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration. Energy is put in brackets because it not a substance:
Notice that the word equation for respiration is the reverse of the word equation for photosynthesis. Check back if you are not sure of this.
Plant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe.
As we can see from the word equations respiration and photosynthesis are opposites. Respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygen.
So what happens to a plant overall? This depends on whether it is in the dark or the light, and how bright the light is.
Plants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.
Neither gas is taken in or given out, as each cancels the other out
Photosynthesis usually results in a net food gain (net glucose gain), once respiration has been accounted for. This means that there is an increase in the biomass of the plant.
Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring.

167,"How a text ends is just as important as how it begins. Good endings should leave the reader feeling satisfied.
Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing.
In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle.
As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"". The last sentence is a statement of the writer's own opinion, but this doesn't alter the fact that it is, or has been, a discursive text.
So, when answering how effective the beginning or ending of a text is, here's a quick checklist you might find helpful:
Does it use language in the same way as the rest of the text?
Is it satisfying? Do you really feel that the text is complete?
Does it suit the tone of the whole extract?
Does it use language in the same way?

Inform, explain and describe - Add the senses
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs.
Here's a typical writing to describe question:
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff.

522,"Liquids and gases do not have a fixed shape. They can flow and fill their containers, but solids cannot. The particle model explains why.
Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place.
Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works.

Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person.

Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

89,"> Measures of average - The mode
The mode is the only average that can have more than one value.
When finding the mode, it helps to order the numbers first.
Find the mode of each of the following sets of numbers:
a) 3, 7, 1, 3, 4, 8, 3
b) 2, 7, 2, 1, 4, 7, 3
a) Start by placing the numbers in order:
1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8
The number 3 occurs most often so the mode is
b) Start by placing the numbers in order:
1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 7
The numbers 2 and 7 occur more often than all other numbers so the modes are
In this frequency table, the mode is the value with the highest frequency:
In this example the modal shoe size is 7, because more people take size 7 than any other size.

Astronomy and space science - Gravitational forces
All objects are attracted towards each other by a force called
. Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a star, planet or moon. You can find out more about gravity in the Revision Bite called
Gravitational forces between the Sun and planets keep the planets in
around the Sun. Without these forces, the planets would fly off into deep space.
Their orbits are slightly squashed circles called
. Diagrams often show the orbits as very squashed, but this is just to get a sense of perspective and to fit the diagrams onto the page.
The planets furthest out are also the coldest because they receive the least heat energy from the Sun.
take more time to complete an orbit
For example, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, takes just 88 Earth days to complete an orbit. But Neptune, the furthest out, takes 164 Earth years to complete an orbit.
The graph shows the distances of the planets from the Sun and the time it takes them to orbit once around it. The shape of the curve shows that the further out a planet is the longer it takes to orbit the Sun.

Explore, imagine and entertain - Appealing to the senses
One way of being creative is appealing to the senses.
Let's go back to our description of a coastline. Imagine you want to write about a cliff, concentrating on the sense of sound, sight, touch, taste and smell.
- the waves crashed on the rocks beneath and I heard the gulls screaming above me.
- the heavy, grey rocks looked as if they were about to slide into the leaden sea.
-the wind lifted my hair and I felt sudden gusts sting my face.
- the spray from the waves hit my face and I could taste the salty water on my lips.
- the damp, warm scent of the seaweed rose gently.
Now, see if you can use the same list of senses to describe another sea scene. This time, describe a sunny beach. You don't have to tell a story, just make your description come alive and imagine that you really are there. Once you've written it, compare your ideas to ours on the next page...

92,"> Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
Behaviour of matter - Pressure in gases
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert
on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this.
The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure.
This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in.
Gas particles hit the walls of their container and cause pressure
. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts.
This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.

59,"> Compounds and mixtures - Separating mixtures
The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have.
This is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper.
from a liquid. (An insoluble substance is one that does not dissolve).
Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water.
from a liquid (a soluble substance does dissolve, to form a solution).
For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution.
from a solution. For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed into a separate container. The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind.
from each other. For example, ethanol (alcohol) can be separated from a mixture of ethanol and water by fractional distillation. This method works because the two liquids have different boiling points.

Acids, bases and metals - Naming salts
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used.
The name of a salt has two parts:
the first part comes from the metal in the base used
the second part comes from the acid that was used
Where does the name potassium nitrate come from?
These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt:
How can we make copper sulfate? The first part of the name is 'copper', so we need a base containing copper. We could use copper oxide or copper carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'sulfate', so we need to use sulfuric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
copper sulfate + water + carbon dioixde
How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid.
Here are word equations for those reactions.
sodium chloride + water + carbon dioxide
It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.

Energy transfer and storage - Thermal energy transfer
When a substance is heated, its particles gain energy and vibrate more vigorously. The particles bump into nearby particles and make them vibrate more. This passes the thermal energy through the substance by
, from the hot end to the cold end.
This is how the handle of a metal spoon soon gets hot when the spoon is put into a hot drink.
Substances that allow thermal energy to move easily through them are called conductors. Metals are good conductors of thermal energy.

The particles in liquids and gases can move from place to place.
happens when particles with a lot of thermal energy in a liquid or gas move, and take the place of particles with less thermal energy. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection.
In order to see this content you need to have both
. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it gives off.
No particles are involved in radiation, unlike conduction and convection. This means that thermal energy transfer by radiation can even work in space, but conduction and convection cannot.
Radiation is how we can feel the heat of the Sun, even though it is millions of kilometres away in space.
Infrared cameras give images even in the dark, because they are detecting heat, not visible light.
Conduction and convection need moving particles to transfer the thermal energy, but radiation does not.

395,"> Inform, explain and describe - Informing
The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure.
Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September.
It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this:
This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below:
These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school.

Acids, bases and metals - Bases and alkalis
Bases are substances that react with acids and neutralise them. They are usually metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates or metal hydrogen carbonates. Many bases are insoluble - they do not dissolve in water.

All alkalis are bases, but only soluble bases are alkalis
You will have used some strong bases and alkalis at school, such as

It is wise to wear gloves when using these substances, otherwise they will react with your skin and burn it.

487,"It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements.
Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.

652,"Your body is constantly under attack. Dirt and germs surround your body. Only one thing stands between dirt and the organs inside your body-skin.
Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things.
Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot.
Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body.
The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen.
The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature.
All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.

541,"Steve Cantees is a high school principal. He always worries about his students' grades and behavior. This year, he is also concerned about their school clothes.
His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees.
Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans.
For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds.
Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic.""
Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall.
Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist.""
Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said.
Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother.
Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said.

318,"Theodor Seuss Geisel (1904-1991) was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He wrote more than 40 children's books and illustrated some of them. The chart on the left shows the top five best-selling Dr. Seuss books of all time.
In 1960, a publisher bet Dr. Seuss he could not write a book using only 50 different words. Seuss wrote

407,"Admiral Richard Byrd was one of the first people to explore Antarctica. Beginning in 1928, the U.S. explorer led several expeditions across the frozen continent. Sometime between 1939 and 1941, Byrd or one of his group buried a Hershey chocolate bar in the ice near the South Pole. The candy bar remained buried for 60 years.
Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily. The Army told Hershey the bars should taste ""just a little better than a boiled potato,"" so that soldiers wouldn't eat too many of them.

202,"By Jeff Ives and Lisa M. Guidone
Republicans and Democrats compete for control of Congress.
The countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 7, Americans will head to the polls to vote in the
Midterm elections happen in the middle of a presidents term in office. (Voters choose a president every four years. The next presidential election is in 2008.)
Members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol in what is called a joint session.
Midterm elections give voters a chance to choose people to represent their state in
Members of Congress make up the U.S.
Congress, the legislative branch of government, makes our nations laws.
On Election Day, candidates will compete for 33 of 100 seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Elections for governors will also be held in 36 states.
Members of Congress typically belong to one of the two main
in the United States: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about government goals. This election will decide whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party controls Congress for the next two years.
Republicans currently have control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans have had the upper hand in the House since 1994. Republicans have also controlled the Senate for most of the past 12 years.
A party controls the House of Representatives or the Senate when its members win a
or more than half, of the seats in it. (See
.) Why is control of Congress so important? The party in power can more easily accomplish its goals and shape U.S. law.
For months, representatives from both political parties have tried to win over voters. Their members have been speaking about important issues, or problems, our country faces. Some of those issues are the war in Iraq, gas prices, and health care. (See
""Our country is facing some serious challenges here and around the world,"" Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told
""At home, our economy has made it harder and harder for working people to make ends meet."" He added that ""the war in Iraq and emerging threats from other nations present new challenges to our national security.""
""Our top priority is to ensure that we continue to keep Americans safe while spreading freedom and democracy abroad,"" Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, told
""Republicans will also work to keep taxes and healthcare prices low so that families have more money to spend on things that are important to them.""
Which party will come out on top in this election? Its up to the voters to decide.
Here are some key issues on voters minds this election season.
Recent polls show that Americans support for the war in Iraq has dropped. President George W. Bush and many Republicans say the war is an important part of making the United States safer. Many Democrats say its time to rethink U.S. strategy in Iraq.
Gas prices have been high for the last year. Only recently have they begun to dip. Many voters are worried about the high cost of gas. They want to hear plans for making gas more affordable.
About 45 million Americans dont have health insurance. If they get sick, it will be difficult for them to pay for medical care and drugs on their own. Voters are looking for ways in which the government can make health care more affordable.
Which election issues are most important to you and your family? Why?

85,"Eileen Collins was the first female shuttle commander for NASA.
As a little girl, Eileen Collins dreamed of becoming an astronaut when she grew up. ""I wanted to fly the space shuttle,"" she said. ""When I was very young and first started reading about astronauts, there were no women astronauts.""
After many years of hard work in college, flight school, and the military, Collins's dream came true. She made history in 1995 as the first woman to pilot a space shuttle. In 1999, she made history again when she became the first female shuttle
for NASA, the U.S. space agency. A commander is someone who leads a crew.
Collins may enjoy the distinction of being the first female shuttle commander, but she hopes it's ""not for long!"" A
is an accomplishment that sets a person apart from others. Collins wants more women to follow in her footsteps. ""The young people are going to be the ones to take us on to more exciting adventures,"" she said.
NASA's space shuttles have been confined to Earth since February 1, 2003. On that tragic day, the space shuttle
exploded after a 16-day mission. All seven astronauts aboard were killed.
During liftoff, a piece had broken off
's fuel tank and smashed a hole in the wing's heat-resistant tiles. Those tiles protect the shuttle from the very high temperatures that the craft experiences when speeding back into Earth's atmosphere. The damage went undetected, and
After the accident, space travel seemed riskier than ever. Because of the dangers, some people wondered whether NASA's shuttles would return to space.
Now NASA officials say it's time. Collins will lead the historic return-to-flight mission. The mission is scheduled for May or June on the space shuttle
Although NASA's shuttles have been grounded, they haven't been collecting dust. In fact, Collins and her crew of six astronauts have been very involved in updates to the shuttles to prevent another disaster. (See ""
Collins and NASA officials are confident that the shuttle is safer than ever, and the crew is ready for the upcoming mission. ""It's time for us to go fly,"" said Collins. ""If [the shuttle] wasn't safe, I wouldn't get on it.""

through a slow somersault called a flip. This will be the first time this
, or move, will be done. The flip will help the crew check for any damage to the heat-resistant tiles.
The mission's success will be measured on how the safety improvements made to
work. Collins views a successful, safe mission as a chance to prove to the world that NASA has reduced the risk of space travel.
To Collins and the crew, there is more than success at stake. They believe the mission will honor the lost astronauts of
. ""It's their legacy we're continuing,"" said a crew member.
NASA has been working to make the shuttle safer. New inspection tools and cameras have been installed on
. Changes have been made in the fuel tank design to make sure that no parts fall off during the launch.
Once in space, the astronauts will control a robotic arm called a boom from inside the shuttle. A camera at the end of the boom will look for damage on the shuttle's underside and wings. If damage is detected, the astronauts can attempt to repair it or wait to be rescued at the International Space Station.
Given the dangers of space travel, should the shuttle program continue? Why or why not?

675,"Gum chewing has been a sticky issue in Singapore. For the first time in 11 years, Singapore, an island in Asia, will allow the sale of gum.
The change comes after recent trade talks between the United States and Singapore. The new policy has a couple of catches. Gum can be sold only in pharmacies, and it must have dentists seal of approval.
Why did Singapore stop the sale of gum in previous years? Singapore is known for its extreme cleanliness. In 1992, the country stopped the sale of chewing gum because people were leaving gooey wads on sidewalks, buildings, buses, and subways. How gross is that?

687,"While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg.
Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

427,"A NASA Spacecraft Lands on an Asteroid for the First Time.
On February 12, scientists on Earth fired rockets on the
spacecraft, turning it toward Eros. Eros is an
, or space rock that is orbiting the sun. As the spacecraft slowly descended, it bounced and scientists were afraid the craft would crash.
Shown is the location of the asteroid belt in our solar system, and the orbit of Eros.
: The planets and their orbits are not drawn to scale.
began its incredible space odyssey five years ago. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the spacecraft in 1996. For the next four years,
sped toward Eros, covering nearly 2 billion miles.
After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid.
completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded,
would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [
] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth.
NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.
Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the
. Eros, however, is a kind of asteroid that comes closer to Earth than most asteroids. Such asteroids are called
. Scientists believe that Eros may be similar to the near-Earth asteroid that slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, probably killing the dinosaurs.
About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say.
There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros.
The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

778,"A new tennis star has arrived. Andy Roddick claimed his championship trophy in early September. He won his first major tennis tournament at the U.S. Open in New York, defeating Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero.
""It hasn't sunk in,"" said an emotional Roddick after the match. ""I came to this tournament so many times as a little kid and watched from way up there [in the stands].
Along with his trophy, Roddick accepted a $1 million winning prize. Because of this championship win, Roddick has risen to number two in the tennis rankings, which is a career record for him. However, Ferrero, who won the French Open, still holds the top slot.
The four Grand Slam tournament in tennis are the Australian Open, Wimbledon the French Open, and the U.S. Open.
With Roddick's win, the torch has been passed to a new American tennis generation. Just days before Roddick's victory, American tennis star Pete Sampras announced his retirement from the sport. Sampras won the U.S. Open in 2002. He was just few years younger than the 21-year-old Roddick when he took home his first U.S. Open title in 1990.

251,"For a moment, 8-year-old Aidan Gold of Bothell, Washington, thought he was stuck. He stood at the edge of a
on Mount Hausstock in Switzerland. A ravine is a small, narrow valley with steep sides. The rocks and ice under his feet were unstable. Aidan didnt think he would be able to cross the huge gap in front of him.
""There seemed to be nowhere to put my foot,"" Aidan told
He spotted a rock jutting out in the middle of the gap and took a gigantic step. ""I thought that I wouldnt make it,"" he says.
But he did make it acrossand all the way to the top of the 10,400-foot mountain. The trek up Mount Hausstock was just one of the high points in the Gold familys recent four-month-long climbing adventure. Their trip took them from Switzerland to Kathmandu, Nepal.
Aidan and his father, Warren, also reached the
of Mnch in the Alps in Europe and Island Peak in the Himalayas in Asia. A summit is the top of a mountain. Aidan is likely the youngest person to reach the top of Island Peak, according to members of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
The Gold family has been climbing mountains since before Aidan could walk. His parents strapped baby Aidan to their backs while climbing peaks all over the world. Since then, Aidan has conquered peaks in the worlds highest mountain chains. ""Aidan is very driven and has an intense focus,"" Warren Gold told
""He just wants to get to the top!""

179,"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed.
Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks.
The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8? hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night.
Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said.
Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said.
In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should.
Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school.
Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep.
Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' ""
If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?

109,"Last month in New Jersey, two soccer teams were locked in a tied game. The game finally ended in a dramatic finish.
The game did not end with a tie-breaking shoot-out, however. It ended because of a fight between parents and coaches.
The fight started because one coach wanted the other coach to move from behind the goal during a shoot-out kick. Soon the coaches were yelling at each other. Then parents ran onto the field, and some of the adults threw punches.
No one was hurt and no kids were involved in the fight. But many towns across the United States are wondering what can be done to stop these kinds of ugly scenes from happening.
Many of the fights at kids' sporting events start because of decisions made by referees. ""There are going to be bad calls, and refs have been called names. But that's part of the game,"" Barry Mano told
. Mano is the president of the National Association of Sports Officials.
In kids' sporting events today, bad calls can result in a lot worse than name-calling, Mano said. ""We are seeing between 50 and 100 attacks a year on referees.""
that fighting at kids' sporting events is a national problem. ""We need to have long-term education"" to teach people how to behave at sporting events and solve the problem, Mano said.
Mano said that parents must keep in mind that they are important role models for kids. He also said the quality of referees at kids' sporting events needs to be improved.
""Sports are a great place for kids to learn. We just have to make sure that kids can have fun while playing,"" said Fred Engh. Engh is president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports. The group promotes good sporting behavior among kids, parents, and coaches involved with youth sports.
that there is one important thing kids can do to help prevent bad scenes at sporting events. ""Kids can remind their parents that this is just a game and that it's a time to have fun,"" Engh said.
What are some other ways to prevent fights at sporting events?

635,"The Sequel of Tut and His Treasures
Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""
King Tut and his treasures first visited the United States in the 1970s. That display attracted a whopping 8 million visitors. The new exhibit looks at what life was like for Tut and other
who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British
Howard Carter made one of history's greatest finds. An archaeologist is a person who digs up ancient ruins and studies the past. The long-lost tomb contained Tut's
, or preserved body. The mummy was buried inside three gold coffins within a
, or stone coffin. A mask of solid gold rested over the mummy's face.
Glistening riches filled King Tut's tomb. They included statues, jewelry, weapons, the king's golden throne and other furniture, and even childhood games. The ancient Egyptians believed in the
. They buried their dead with many items they believed could be used in life after death.
Although Tut's mask and mummy are too fragile to be removed from Egypt, some of Carter's other fascinating finds are on display in the latest exhibit. ""
"". One of the treasures, a wooden figure of the boy king, is the first object that visitors see when they enter the exhibit. In the darkened room, a light shines on the wooden figure. The figure is depicted without Tut's famous gold or jewels.
""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.
, or follow-up, exhibit different from the one that visited the United States in the 1970s? ""The first exhibit was about the discovery of the tomb,"" Silverman told
""This exhibition is about the life of the young kinghis family, his history, his responsibilities.""
The wealth of objects discovered in the young king's tomb leads scientists to wonder what might have been contained in the tombs of other pharaohs. Those tombs, unlike Tut's, were
, or robbed, long ago. As Silverman says, ""Egypt continues to fascinate.""
King Tut's showstopping exhibit includes more than 130
. An artifact is a human-made object. Only 13 of those artifacts were included in the last Tut tour in the 1970s. Most have never before left Egypt.

in the shape of an ankh, an Egyptian symbol of life, was buried with Tut.
held Tut's liver, which Egyptians believed would be needed in the afterlife. Canopic jars are special containers used to hold the preserved organs of the dead. A peek inside shows rows of ancient Egyptian writing.
Why might King Tut's tomb have been the only royal burial chamber not damaged by thieves?

478,"Snakehead fish and other invasive species threaten the environment.
Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem.
Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of
that currently threaten environments in the United States.
An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack
in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area.
Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California.
Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools.
In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes.
And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night.
Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water.
Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt
An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals that live together in the same area.
""Our natural ecosystems are the primary source of our food and drinking water,"" scientist Lisa Gould told
. ""Ecosystems help keep our air clean. They give us medicines. Without them, we could not exist for long.""

The young beetles chomp through the inner bark of ash trees, destroying the tunnels inside that move water from the roots to the leaves.
Coqui frogs have an appetite for Hawaii's insects and are leaving nothing for many endangered birds in the area. To hear these ear-piercing frogs, visit
Each year, a female zebra mussel can lay 30,000 to 100,000 eggs. When those eggs hatch, the baby mussels gobble up food and oxygen, leaving nothing for other underwater creatures.

482,"Cleaning up the environment is in the bag for one student.
For years, Samantha Goldfeld, 11, and her family have carried their own reusable cloth bags to the grocery store. ""My family is saving almost 800 disposable bags each year,"" the sixth grader from Scottsdale, Arizona, told
""Then we got to thinking about what that number would look like if everyone carried cloth bags instead of using paper or plastic.""
More than 500 billion plastic shopping bags are used each year worldwide. Plastic bags pollute city streets, jam recycling machines, and harm animals that get caught in the bags or ingest them. Plus,
are needed to manufacture plastic bags. Nonrenewable sources cannot be replaced.
Now Samantha has the chance to teach others about the benefits of reusable cloth bags. Samantha belongs to the community service group, Roots and Shoots, which will take part in National and Global Youth Service Day. Founded in 1986, the annual project is the largest service event in the world. From April 20 to 22, millions of young people across the globe will participate in volunteer projects, ranging from recycling to tutoring young children.
To encourage more people to use reusable cloth bags, Samantha and other Roots and Shoots members will host an information session. They plan to talk about the benefits of reusable cloth bags and provide tips for reducing plastic bag use.
Samantha is looking forward to the service event. ""Doing community service makes a difference for the environment, animals, and people,"" she says. ""Together we can make a huge difference for our planet.""

492,"On March 22, Kelsey Penfield, age 9, was working at her desk at Maplehurst Elementary Schook in Norwalk, Ohio. She was also chewing her pen cap. Suddenly, she swallowed the cap.
The pen cap became lodged in Kelsey's throat, and she began choking on it. She tried coughing up the cap, but the cap wouldn't move. Unable to breathe, Kelsey began pointing at her throat.
Kelsey's classmate Elizabeth Muirhead, age 9, realized that Kelsey was choking. Elizabeth immediately sprang into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver on her classmate, saving her life.
Elizabeth had learned the Heimlich maneuver in an issue of
caught up with the two girls to ask them about that fateful day.
: What happened the day that Kelsey started choking?
We were in class doing our grammar work. That's when Kelsey started choking. There was a boy between us, but he didn't know what was going on. Kelsey was pointing to her neck. I asked her if she was choking, and she nodded. That's when I ran over to her and did the Heimlich maneuver.
What were your thoughts? Were you scared?
: I was really scared. The first time I tried the Heimlich, I didn't do it that hard. I was afraid of hurting Kelsey. The second time, I squeezed a little harder. Then the third time, the pen cap just flew out. All the time I was thinking that Kelsey is my best friend and I'm not going to let her die.
How did you know how to perform the Heimlich maneuver?
: We read about it in an issue of
. Mrs. Moore put us in groups of two, and we practiced doing it.
: Kelsey, What was this experience like for you?
: I was really scared. I was chewing on a pen cap, and all of a sudden it slid down my throat. I couldn't breathe. I'm not going to chew on pen caps anymore. You shouldn't really chew on anything. You never know when you can accidentally choke.
1. Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist.
2. Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage.

485,"Photography did not exist in George Washington's lifetime. So how do we know what he looked like? Recently, a team of experts led by scientist Jeffrey Schwartz used historical
or clues, to build a statue of Washington at age 45. Here's how the team did it.
 The team began by scanning this mold of Washington's face into a computer. A sculptor had made the mold of the 53-year-old Washington's face in 1785. Washington's
or false teeth, showed the shape of his mouth.
 Once the team had an idea of what Washington's face looked like at age 53, sculptors re-created the face to show what it would have looked like at age 45. The nose and ears continue to grow during adulthood, so those features were sculpted smaller.
 Painters added color to the statue based on historical documents that depict Washington with pale skin and grayish blue eyes.
 The statue was placed in an exhibit that shows Washington leading his troops during the long winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1777.
If you could join a team of scientists in re-creating a historical figure, which person would you choose? Why?

670,"News Shorts: New Rings and Moons for Uranus
Astronomers have discovered new rings around Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope.
Astronomers have made an out-of-this-world discovery. New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show a previously unknown pair of rings around Uranus. They also reveal two additional small moons circling the seventh planet from the sun. The latest find brings the total number of known rings to 13 and moons to 27.
A ""second ring system"" has been found circling Uranus.
It is the first time new rings have been discovered in 20 years. In 1986, the
2 spacecraft flew past Uranus and sent back thousands of images of its dazzling rings and moons. At that time,
2 found two new rings, in addition to the nine rings previously seen from Earth, along with numerous moons.
After looking at the new photographs, scientists reexamined
2s images. The scientists spotted the new rings and new moons in the older photos. The rings are so far from Uranus that they are being called the planets ""second ring system.""
The newly discovered rings were probably missed earlier because of their faintness. Sometimes you find things you arent looking for,"" says astronomer Mark Showalter.
Uranus is one of the solar systems giant planets made of gas, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. The planet was discovered in 1781.

317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

634,"Ann Thompson is one of the best athletes in the world. She is the captain of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team. She has already won five medals in earlier Paralympic games, and she is determined to win another in Sydney, Australia. Recently,
The Paralympics run from October 18 to 29.
: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from.
: What sports are part of the Paralympics?
: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing.
: Who can compete in the Paralympics?
: This year, 125 countries are sending 4,000 athletes, each with a physical disability.
: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence.
: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career?
: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord.
: How did that accident change your life?
: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk.
I'm the same person today that I was before the accident.
: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team.
: What do you plan to do in Sydney?
: If you could say one thing to the kids of America, what would you tell them?
: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it.

703,"Have you ever touched the bottom of a desk or a table and found that you were touching a blob of old chewing gum? Schools long ago banned chewing gum to keep kids from sticking gum to school furniture.
Officials in Singapore, a country in Asia, totally banned chewing gum about ten years ago. Now that country is allowing people to chew some kinds of gum again.
Gum chewers, however, will need a doctor's prescription. A government official said Singapore will allow pharmacies to sell sugarless gum to sick patients if the rubbery substance can help cure them.
Singapore outlawed gum in 1992. Government officials were concerned that gum chewers were throwing lumps of used gum on streets. People, they said, were also sticking gum to subway cars. Yuck!

245,"First built more than 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China is one of the greatest wonders of the world. Recently, Chinese officials announced that the Great Wall is greater than ever.
Officials had believed that the Great Wall was 4,160 miles long. But they recently discovered another 310-mile section of the wall at its western end. The wall now measures 4,470 miles long. That's equal to the distance from Miami, Florida, to the North Pole!
Most of the wall is made of brick. The newly discovered section, however, is made of sandstone and branches.
The Great Wall was originally built to protect China from invaders. It was built in sections and rebuilt many times. As many as three million people worked on the first section of the wall.

409,"More bears are alive and well, but are they ready to come off the endangered species list?
The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
That wasnt always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their
By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone.
Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy.
Its Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks its a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but its not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnt do it.""
Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not?
The grizzlys return isnt the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists.
In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species.
Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973.
Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

287,"Erin Beth Turner of West Hartford, Connecticut, was among the millions of kids who bought
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
this summer. After buying her copy, the 10-year-old told
, ""I'll read it until I go to bed, and finish it in a few days.""
The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages.
Although many kids say they love reading about Harry, some critics say the books aren't good for kids.
Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter.""
The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told
that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary.""
Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision.
recently talked to people in Zeeland about Harry.
Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga.
Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids
question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures.""
Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing.""
When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun.""
hasn't heard of Harry Potter. He is an orphan with messy hair and a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He lives in England with his mean uncle and aunt. When he was 10, Harry was invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The books are about Harry's adventures at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
is the fourth book in the series. Author J.K. Rowling plans to write seven books about Harry, one for each year he attends Hogwarts.

701,"Imagine ordering an ice cream cone and knowing that it's improving your health. That might be possible in the future. Scientists are experimenting with ways to add extra nutrients to ice cream. Nutrients are the parts of food that the body uses for growth and energy.
One type of nutrient that scientists want to add to ice cream is the group of fatty acids called omega-3. They are found in fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for circulation and help prevent heart disease.
The challenge for scientists is developing a final product that tastes more like ice cream and less like fish. ""It's easier to get people to eat what they're used to than to get them to change their eating pattern,"" said food scientist Bob Roberts.
Roberts wants to provide people with more types of foods from which they can get their omega-3s. Ice cream may just be one fun way to do that!

752,"The National Museum of the American Indian opened on September 21, 2004.
Drumbeats echoed. Songs and cheers filled the air. Spirits soared. More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.
They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.
""[The new museum] is a living tribute to the first Americans,"" museum director W. Richard West Jr. told the crowd. West is a member of the Southern Cheyenne tribe.
Native Americans from Alaska to South America
, or came together, for the museum's opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling.
The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.
Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""

Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans.
Honor the 300th birthday of one of our countrys greatest thinkers, inventors, and statesmen with our classroom play.
Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life.
His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americas most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation.
Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Bens education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work.
His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing.
In honor of the 300th anniversary of Bens birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country.
ACT 1: Ben the Young Man, Boston, 1718-1723
Bens older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper,
In 1718, Bens father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James.
At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes.
Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printingand even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Bens sense of humor and clever writing in those letters,
becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston.
James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Bens writing again. He also finds fault with Bens work, even though Ben rarely makes errors.
I know I am a better printer than he is.
You cant leave! You have to work for me until you are 21!
Youll never find a job in this city! Youll come crawling back to me.
But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia.
The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it.
ACT 2: Ben the Community Leader, Philadelphia, 1723-1740s
After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper,
A few years later, he also publishes
The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Bens sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy.
Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better.
Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphias streets. He redesigns the citys streetlights so that roads are safe at night.
Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood.
Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street!
We need to train men to fight fires so that this doesnt keep happening.
Ben persuades more than 30 men to form the Union Fire Company.
We nominate Ben as our fire chief.
Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people.

The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper.
Bens ideas for Philadelphia help shape how fire departments, hospitals, libraries, and post offices work in other cities.
ACT 3: Ben the Statesman, Philadelphia, 1776
Along with his work in Philadelphia, Ben helps change the course of American history.
At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair.
Ben works to mend the relationship between the Colonies and Britains ruler, King George III.
Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783).
Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britains rule.
We have to decide who should write the Declaration of Independence.
I wont. Many people disagree with my opinions.
I cant. I am not a writer.
I am unsure about independence from Britain.
You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect.
When Thomas Jefferson finishes his draft, he shows it to Ben.
Ive made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
On July 4, a group of representatives from the 13 Colonies approve the Declaration of Independence and some people sign the document.
This for King George, so he can read it without his glasses.
On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain.
Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution.
Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man.
If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?

399,"Students in Colorado are riding a school skateboarding trend.
Skateboard class is rolling into schools! For sixth grader Carlos Cervantes, learning to skateboard takes a lot of work, but its worth it. ""[On] the first day of class, I was scared, but I tried it,"" the 12-year-old told
""After two days of practice, I felt more comfortable.""
Carlos is learning to skateboard in an after-school program at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado. Skateboards are now finding their way into the regular school day as well. Douglass Elementary in nearby Boulder is the first public school in the country to offer skateboarding in gym class.
Douglasss physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali starts his skateboarding class by teaching students how to put on their safety gear and how to fall without getting hurt. Then kids start rolling around the gym. ""Sometimes theyre so excited, they fall. Theyre screaming, Im doing it! Im doing it!"" says Cendali, laughing. ""Its such a thrill to see those kids succeed and see their smiles.""
PE instructors around the country have started teaching classes such as skateboarding, in-line skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts call these sports ""the new PE."" These individual sports are designed to help fight childhood
by getting kids involved in fun physical activities. Obesity is the condition of being dangerously overweight. Another goal of these nontraditional activities is to promote lifelong fitness habits.
Since 1980, the percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled. The time students spend in PE class, however, is decreasing. Many schools have dropped gym classes to save money or to provide students with more classroom time. Only 8 percent of elementary schools offer gym class to students every day, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because students have less PE time, teachers are searching for ways to keep kids moving. ""[Skateboarding] is a great activity that keeps kids engaged in physical movement and gives them new skills and interests,"" says West Middle Schools afterschool program coordinator, Lindsey Johnson.
Some people say skateboarding not only offers health and fitness benefits but also teaches life lessons that could help kids with their schoolwork. Students who are learning to skateboard often spend hours practicing a new trick before they get it right. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with something, they will ultimately succeed,"" says education expert Richard Sagor of Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
Carloss skateboarding teacher at West Middle School, Eric Klassen, agrees. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before [he or she] is successful,"" Klassen says. ""We tell students that they shouldnt say I cant do it unless theyve tried 600 to 900 times.""
Klassens students take his advice to heart. ""It took me 600 times to learn one new trick,"" says Martin Carrera, 11.
Over the last decade, team sports have dropped in popularity while individual sports, such as skateboarding, have been on the rise. This trend may affect the kinds of activities PE teachers offer in gym class. Learning individual sports gives all students an opportunity to exercise, whether they make it onto a school team or not.
Imagine that your school offers a skateboarding class. Would such a class have a positive effect on you? Explain.

759,"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf.
The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep.
U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people.
The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area.
The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again.
What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous.
Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities.
Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well.
""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me.""
The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said.

77,"Groundbreaking begins for a monument dedicated to an important leader.
Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on Washington, August 28, 1963.
On a summer day in 1963, more than 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to rally for equal rights. There, they heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Today, construction of a memorial honoring King is under way about a half mile from the Lincoln Memorial, where King gave that famous speech. The new memorial will be the first on the National Mall to honor an African American.
The groundbreaking ceremony for the King memorial was held on November 13. President George W. Bush, former President William Jefferson Clinton, poet Maya Angelou, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey were among the speakers at the event. ""We give Martin Luther King his rightful place among the many Americans honored on the National Mall,"" Bush told the crowd of about 5,000 people.
King (19291968) dedicated his life to helping others. As a boy growing up in the U.S. South, King witnessed African Americans being treated unfairly. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, African Americans were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. African Americans also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests.
Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott to protest segregation. For 381 days, African Americans
or refused to use, public buses in the Alabama city. A year after the boycott began, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses was illegal.
King gained national attention from the boycott. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed.
are personal rights to freedom and equality guaranteed to all U.S. citizens and protected by the Constitution.
The King memorial is scheduled to be completed in 2008. The design uses water, stone, and trees to represent the themes of justice, democracy, and hope. The King memorial will also include a boulder called the Stone of Hope, from which will emerge a 30-foot figure of King. The memorial will contain a circular stone wall chiseled with King's words.
King's dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. The design of the memorial is based on a line from his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech: ""We will be able to hew [cut] out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.""

104,"On a December morning, shortly before dawn, Danny Thompson, age 10, looked through a small telescope. He saw a round red disk-Mars. ""Someday I will go to Mars,"" Danny said later.
Over the years, many people have dreamed of going to Mars. The day when travel to Mars is possible is coming closer. Robot spacecraft have already traveled there. Those spacecraft have made many amazing discoveries.
The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is
. It started orbiting the red planet more than a year ago.
Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars.
Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan.
There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls.
- a vehicle that flies through space
-a device that makes objects look closer than they are
show long, dark streaks on the walls of some canyons. The streaks might indicate areas where water recently flowed down the canyon walls.
Not all scientists agree, however. Many scientists say wind blowing across Mars caused the streaks. Scientists have long known about powerful wind storms on Mars. Some of those storms blow across the surface for months at a time.
Even if liquid water and life do not exist on Mars today, many scientists agree with Danny. They want to explore the red planet.""I'm interested in Mars because it's probably the most fascinating planet in the solar system besides Earth, and probably the only one that could have ever supported other forms of life,"" said one NASA scientist.

273,"Huskies along the trail during start day, March 1998.
And they're off! Teams of specially trained dogs are racing to the finish line across one of the toughest terrains in the world.
Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6.
The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route.
The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami.
A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds.
guide and care for the dogs. Mushers must stop at all 26 checkpoints along the trail. There, animal doctors, called
, check the health of each dog.
During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods.
Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush.
During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told
In 1925, sled dogs in Anchorage delivered lifesaving medicine to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod teams follow the same route. The race
, or honors, that event and the role dog teams have played in the state's history.
Experiencing this year's race up close is fourth-grade teacher Jeff Peterson, from Minnesota. Peterson, who was selected as the 2004 Teacher on the Trail, is reporting on the race.
that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true.""
In January 1959, Alaska became the 49th state. More than twice the size of Texas, Alaska is the largest state.
Alaska's nickname is ""The Last Frontier"" because much of the land is wilderness that remains unsettled.
Mount McKinley, in Alaska, is the tallest mountain in North America.
In 1867, the United States bought Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million, or about 2 cents per acre.
Contrary to popular belief, Alaska is not one giant icebox! In some parts of the state, summer temperatures can reach into the 80s.

678,"These days, almost everyone seems to have a cell phone. Last year, 128 million people had cell phone service. More and more people sign up every day.
Many people keep their cell phones for only a short time. On average, people throw away their cell phones after 18 months.
According to a new report issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, old cell phones could harm the environment. By 2005, people in the United States will throw away 130 million phones a year. That's 65,000 tons of phones!
""[Throwing away cell phones] is becoming a very serious problem because the amount of cell phone waste is growing,"" said one of the writers of the report.
Environmental experts worry that the chemicals in cell phone batteries could pollute the environment. They want the companies that make cell phones to use fewer poisonous chemicals to make the phones.

201,"Saying you're sorry or apologizing when you hurt someone is always the right thing to do. In fact, scientists say that even some fish apologize when they accidentally hurt other fish.
Cleaner fish are fish that clean tiny plants and animals off other fish. Every so often, a cleaner fish accidentally nibbles on the fish it is cleaning. According to scientist Redouan Bshary and Manuela Wuerth, to apologize for biting the fish, the cleaner fish rubs the other fish's fins.

275,"A squirrel named Twiggy has a talent that might make its rodent friends jealous. Here, Twiggy, the world's only water-skiing squirrel, makes a splash at a boat show in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

96,"Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith was recently honored at the United Nations in New York City for her courage during last years tsunami. Two weeks before the December 26, 2004, disaster, she had studied tsunamis in her geography class at her school just outside London, England. Her teacher showed the class a video of a tsunami. Tilly paid very close attention.
When her family was vacationing on a beach in Phuket, Thailand, Tilly immediately recognized the warning signs of a tsunami. Her quick thinking saved the lives of about 100 people in the area.
""I saw this bubbling on the water, right on the edge, and foam sizzling just like in a frying pan,"" Tilly says. ""The water was coming in, but it wasnt going out again.""
Tilly knew the waves would pound the shore within minutes. With the help of a security guard and a chef, Tilly spread the warning. People
or fled, the beach just minutes before the tsunamis devastating waves struck.

667,"Can you imagine not having a chance to play tag or hopscotch in the schoolyard after lunch? For many students around the country, their afternoon break is quickly becoming history. Nearly 40 percent of elementary schools have either eliminated or are considering eliminating recess, according to the American Association for the Childs Right to Play.
Why? Some school officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They hope that more time in class will help students perform better on standardized tests.
In addition, many schools are cutting recess because they can no longer afford to offer it. Those schools dont have the money to hire lunch aides or to buy sports equipment for the playground.
Most teachers and parents say that recess has a place in school. Nine of 10 teachers say free time spent with friends is an important part of the school day, according to a recent survey conducted by the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA).
Education experts also stress that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends.
At recess, many students learn how to
or work together, with other students. Many studies also show that recess helps improve test scores.
The National PTA and Cartoon Network recently launched a program called Rescuing Recess. To kick off the campaign, children across the country are being asked to write letters to let their local and state school officials know that recess is important to them.
""We know many children enjoy recess as a welcome break from the classroom, and parents appreciate the balance that it offers between schoolwork and play,"" says Anna Weselak, National PTA president.
Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess? Dont worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving.
Turn on music and dance in your room.
to express your views about break time and to let local school boards know that recess is important to you.

401,"The Ancient Pueblo cliff city gets ready for its 100th birthday finale.
Park rangers are bringing history to light. On December 9, they plan to
or light up, an ancient cliff city in southwestern Colorado.
Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
A century ago, the U.S. government set aside Mesa Verde (MAYsuh VER-day) as a national park. The park protects the ancient Native American city known for its multistoried cliff dwellings built into canyon walls on a large
(A plateau is an area of high, flat land.)
(100th anniversary) throughout the year, park officials have organized various festivities. Events include Native American dances, music, and tours of sites never before open to the public. There are also craft demonstrations, such as pottery making and basket weaving.
(fih- NAH-lee), or big ending, park rangers will light up two of the biggest cliff dwellingsCliff Palace and Spruce Tree House. The rangers will use about 100 lanterns. ""Visitors [will] see what it may have looked like 800 years ago,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told
The centennial celebration honors the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh) people, formerly known as the Anasazi (ah-nuh-SAH-zee). The word
means ""town"" in Spanish. The Ancient Pueblo, who constructed Mesa Verdes cliff dwellings, are the ancestors of todays Pueblo people of the U.S. Southwest.
The Ancient Pueblo were an agricultural people who
or lived, in the area more than 1,000 years ago. They mainly farmed corn, beans, and squash.
From 600 until the 1100s, the Ancient Pueblo lived primarily on the
top. (A mesa is a plateau with steep sides.) They later moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there. After 1300, they
or traveled, south to New Mexico and Arizona.
Why did the Ancient Pueblo abandon the region? ""We dont know the exact reason,"" says Puskar. Some possibilities are climate change, drought, or overuse of the areas soil and other resources.
In the late 1800s, explorers found the ancient dwellings and removed pottery, baskets, and other
from the site. An artifact is any object made or used by people in the past.
On June 29, 1906, Congress passed a bill to establish Mesa Verde National Park. The bill, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt, protects the cultural treasures at this historic Native American site. It is a federal crime to remove or destroy any historic object or monument on land owned by the U.S. government.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Puskar says about the park. ""It was worthwhile to celebrate the past that comes from the Pueblo people as well as our nations past. [The centennial] provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
is Spanish for ""green table."" Spanish explorers named the region for its high, tree-covered plateaus.
Mesa Verde National Park protects more than 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancient Pueblo. The two largest dwellings contain about 160 rooms each.
By building their dwellings out of stone, the Ancient Pueblo could construct homes on top of one another. By 1100, their structures were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.

387,"recently told you about some problems manatees face. A poll found that most Florida voters want more done to protect manatees. The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees.
""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures.""
Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track.
Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions.

421,"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball on January 1.
The NBA has brought back its old ball after trying out a new ball covered in synthetic material.
For the past few months, players had to use a ball covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players, including O'Neal, complained the plasticcoated basketball was a bad decision. They said the new ball didn't bounce as well as the leather ball. The new ball also cut their hands. ""The new ball is terrible,"" O'Neal, the Miami Heat center, says.
Scientists at the University of Texas at Arlington ran experiments comparing the synthetic and leather balls. The biggest difference they found was in the way the new ball absorbs moisture.
The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture than the leather ball does. That means the synthetic ball doesn't become heavier when it comes in contact with players' sweat. It also means the synthetic ball can become slippery because moisture stays on its surface, scientist Kaushik De, who helped conduct the study, told
The return of the leather ball has many NBA players jumping for joy. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us.""

Eleven-year-old Michaela Piersanti from New Haven, Connecticut, thinks the environment needs to be protected all year long. ""We need to keep the Earth clean,"" she said. ""If we pollute, it can make animals sick and possibly kill them.""
occurs when harmful substances are released into the air, water, or land. Water gets polluted from sewage, factories, and chemicals. Pollution harms the plants and animals that live in the water. It also makes drinking water unsafe.
The theme of this year's Earth Day is ""Water for Life."" More than 1 billion people around the world do not have clean drinking water. Many children and their families will test the quality of their local water resources on Earth Day.
found underground. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
The burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air and water. Many scientists think that contributes to the overheating of the Earth.
The Earth Day Network wants people to rely more on clean sources of energy that don't pollute the environment. Some of those sources include sun, wind, and hydrogen power. For example, scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered cars that do not release harmful exhausts into the air the way today's gasoline-powered cars do.

288,"Would you know what to do if a fire started in your home? Every year, more than 400,000 fires begin in U.S. homes. You can prepare for an emergency by making and practicing a home fire escape plan!
all rooms, doors, windows, and smoke alarms.
at least two ways out of each room. That way you will know how to escape no matter where you are, and no matter where the fire is.
a meeting place outside, away from your home, where all members of your household can gather after they have left the building.
any fire escapes or fire stairs in your building if you live in an apartment or high rise. (Talk to your building manager or local fire department about what you should do if a fire starts in your building.)
the location of a neighbor's house, public phone, or call box to alert the fire department. (Or, assign a family member to bring a portable phone when exiting your home.)
""Develop a home fire escape plan with your family. Practice your home escape plan at least twice a year. Pretend that some escape routes are blocked by smoke and fire so that you can practice using different exits. Close all doors behind you as you exit to keep smoke from spreading through your home.

587,"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States.
Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood.
President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades.
The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay.
A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park.
An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands.
The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide
By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades.
The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals.
The maps show (1) how water flowed through the Everglades before farms and towns began draining water from the Everglades, (2) how water now flows through the Everglades, and (3) how water may flow when the plan is completed.
Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society.
Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said.
Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years.""

214,"A ""cat-tastrophe"" recently struck the airport near Providence, Rhode Island. Airport officials were forced to cancel a flight when they found a runaway cat named Muffy sitting in the airplane's wheel well, the place where the landing gear is stored during flight.
The wayward cat had been placed in a cage to be put aboard an airplane. But somehow Muffy escaped and climbed into the wheel well of a nearby plane.
Airport workers spent hours trying to coax the cat down from its hiding place. They even offered Muffy some tasty treats.
Finally, after seven hours, the workers removed panels from the plane's wing and pulled Muffy to safety. Muffy, the runway runaway, was then reunited with her family.

686,"The cheetah cubs born recently at the National Zoo will reach their top speed of 70 miles per hour when they are about a year old.
It was a big day at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. First the mother cheetah came out of her cage. Then came one, two, three, four, five cubs. The babiesborn this summerleaped and played around their mother. The cubs, then just 10 weeks old, weighed only 9 pounds and were about the size of house cats.
The litter was the second born at the zoo in seven monthsand in its 116-year history. Cheetahs are extinct in the wild except in Africa, where only between 8,000 and 10,000 remain.
""They're pretty quick,"" Lauren Afdahl, an animal keeper at the National Zoo, told
. ""Whenever they see something moving, they take off and run."" The cubs will reach their top speed of 70 miles per hour when they are about a year old. That is as fast as a car speeding on the highway.

679,"This will be a very different school year for Rand Amir. The fifth grader is among millions of schoolchildren who went back to school in Iraq in early October.
On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam.""
That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons.
Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world.
The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes.
Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of
, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting.
Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies.
The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity.
They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies.
Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now.""
A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq.
that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said.
The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told
that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture.
Why is it important to be able to think and learn freely?
The class also made a picture book and wrote a message of friendship. The message was translated into Arabic and included in each box. Arabic is the official language of Iraq. ""We hope we can reach out in friendship and make a difference,"" said Winslow.

685,"Utah has a state fruit, a state folk dance, and a state fish. And thanks to a group of determined fourth graders, Utah may soon boast a state reptile.
Students in Laura Grafs social studies classes at Diamond Valley Elementary School in St. George, Utah, are getting a lesson in how a bill becomes a law. They are urging state lawmakers to approve a new state symbolthe western rattler.
The idea for the state reptile came from the schools mascot, a diamondback rattlesnake. The students convinced their state representative, David Clark, to present the bill to the state Congress.
Sixty students from Diamond Valley recently visited the state House of Representatives in Salt Lake City, the state capital. They sang their school song, which mentions the slithery reptile. They also presented Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. with a cherry pie (cherries are the state fruit) and performed a lively square dance (the state folk dance).
The students efforts are paying off. The bill passed the House of Representatives. Next it has to make it through the state Senate before it lands on the governors desk for signing.

130,"Chew on this! Your school cafeteria may be getting a makeover. Members of the U.S. government are trying to pass a new law. It would make school foods healthier. Under the plan, school cafeterias would serve meals with ingredients that are better for you. Vending machines, such as the one below, would also sell healthy snacks.
The idea is part of First Lady Michelle Obamas plan. She hopes to end childhood
That is the condition of being very overweight. About one-third of kids in the United States are too heavy, according to a study. Kids who are overweight are at a higher risk of having health problems.

5,"Super Bowl, here I come! My name is Claire Jordan, and I'm a student at Edu-Prize School in Gilbert, Ariz. I am going to report on the
. The Super Bowl is the National Football League's championship game.
The big game is on February 3 in Glendale, Ariz. I will interview players from both teams before the Super Bowl. I will ask them when they started playing football and what they like most about the sport. Then I'll watch the game live. I will sit with other reporters in a special section of the stadium.
I am mostly looking forward to meeting some players and seeing a professional football game in person. I cannot wait for the Super Bowl!

113,"Monarch butterflies dont use just their heads. They also use whats on top of themtheir
(an-TE-nee)! Those are organs that help butterflies smell and find food. But thats not all they do.
Butterfly: AP Images; Antenna: Photo Researchers, Inc.
This is what a butterflys antenna looks like close-up.
A new study shows that antennae help monarchs find their way during
That is the movement from one place to another when the seasons change. Every fall, millions of monarchs fly from Canada and the United States to Mexico.
The insects use the sun to make their way south. Their antennae track the suns location. That helps the butterflies stay on the right path.
Butterflies without antennae dont fly in the correct direction, Steven Reppert told
. He was the leader of the study. That was a real surprise to us.

202,"A filmmaker spies on polar bears in the Arctic.
A huge polar bear walks across the ice. Everything around it is quiet. Suddenly, a smaller bear approaches. It swings at the larger creatures chest. The two animals fall to the ground in a playful wrestling match.
Little do they know, theres a camera hidden in the snow nearby. It is capturing the bears every move. The recorder was placed there by John Downer (above). He filmed polar bears in the Arctic. That is the snowy place at the northernmost part of the world.
Downer is giving people a chance to see polar bears as they never have before. He recently shared his footage with the public. [This film helps] you ... understand what it is like to be an animal, Downer told
A polar bear trails behind a camera.

as ice and snow. To disguise something is to make it look like something else. One recorder is called the snowball cam. It looks like a giant snowball.
Downers cameras did more than just take super shots. They also showed the dangers polar bears face. The sea ice that polar bears stand on to hunt is melting. That makes it harder for the animals to catch food in the water, scientist Geoff York told
York and other wildlife experts hope Downers film will make people want to help the creatures. We [need to act now] so polar bears still have a place to live, York says.
The United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden have land in the Arctic.
Temperatures in the Arctic can range from -76 degrees to 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
Many people who live in the Arctic are Inuit. They are
, or local, to the area. About 150,000 Inuit live there.
How can people protect polar bears and other threatened animals in the Arctic?

125,"Trash thrown on beaches can end up in the ocean and injure or kill marine life.
How will you celebrate Earth Day on April 22? Thousands of kids and adults around the world will make a splash by taking part in a program called ""Dive Into Earth Day."" They will clean up beaches, help scientists count fish, and learn about ways to protect Earth's waters.
, ""We need to protect our oceans."" Trash thrown on beaches can end up in the ocean and injure or kill marine life. Animals such as fish and sea turtles often mistake trash for food and choke on these items.

22,"NASA sets its sights on the moon, then Mars.
Astronauts are aiming for the moon again. This time, though, they plan to stay there. Astronauts hope to live and work on the moon by 2020, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency recently announced plans to build a base there.
At first, four-person crews will stay for a week. By 2024, they will be able to live there for as long as six months.
The base will most likely be built near the moon's north or south pole. The poles get the most sunlight. At those locations, the moon base would be able to use solar power. That is energy from the sun that can be used to create electricity.
The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. At a distance of about 238,900 miles, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, only 12 people have walked on the moon's dusty surface. Those astronauts traveled there on Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.
NASA hopes the moon mission will kick off a new
or time period, of space exploration. Scientists say that living on the moon is the first step in preparing astronauts to travel to Mars. ""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told

642,"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of GaHoole
dont look like cartoonsthey look like real owls! That was the goal of Grant Freckelton and Simon Whiteley. They are
who worked on the new movie. An animator creates art for movies.
student reporter Jackson Brantley talked with the animators.
Jackson Brantley: What is your favorite part of the movie?
We like [the] cool owls that have helmets and battle gear.
JB: How did you create the characters?
[We found photographs of] real owls. We [changed each owl] enough so that it [showed] what the character is like. We tried to make [the main character] sort of wide-eyed.
JB: What do you love most about your job?
I cant think of probably anything better than making movies, because you get to dream and then create your dreams.

641,"Workers clean the Gulf of Mexico after an oil spill.
At a busy aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana, a sea turtle splashes about in clean, clear water. Its hard to imagine that just weeks ago the animal was covered in greasy oil.
Experts wash a bird rescued from the oily water.
the sea turtle from an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. That body of water is south of the United States. To rescue something is to save it.
Until recently, oil had been spilling into the gulf for months. The oil
miles of sea and beaches. To damage something is to harm it. Thousands of animals were trapped in the sticky stuff.
The spill began in April. Workers were drilling from on top of an
in the gulf. That is a building in the sea. It is used to collect oil. Suddenly, the oil rig exploded. The accident caused an oil well at the bottom of the gulf to leak.
Since then, experts have been trying to stop the oil from spreading. They recently plugged the well with cement. Workers are also cleaning the water. The cleanup could take years, experts say.
The work is starting to make a difference, though. Officials recently reopened part of the gulf to fishing. That is good news for people who live near the gulf.
We love the land, Alma Robichaux told
She lives in Louisiana. We cant go anywhere else.
The oil spill isnt the first big trouble for the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina hit the area in August 2005. The huge storm killed more than 1,300 people in five states.
New Orleans, Louisiana, was one of the worst-hit areas. Even today, parts of the city look as if the hurricane just happened. Many peoples homes are still damaged from the storm.
A group of kids works to repair houses. To repair is to fix. The group is called Beacon of Hope.
Student Emma Ridenhour recently lent a hand. After five years, theres still a lot of work to be done, she told
It means a lot that I could ... help.
How might the oil spill affect people in other parts of the country? Why?

277,"Scientists in England are buzzing about a recent discovery. They figured out how bees and other insects fly so well. The research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft.
Cameras and sensors could be attached to the aircraft. These machines may one day be used for monitoring traffic or even for spying.
The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and are
(can bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.
""Our work will make the goal of tiny aircraft, perhaps eventually the size of bees, a step closer,"" says lead scientist Ismet Gursul.

66,"The first U.S. president gets a new look.
Still Picture Branch of the National Archives and Records Administration
Third grader Erin Doherty turned the corner and gasped. A full-color statue of George Washington (17321799) on a horse towered over her. ""He looked real,"" Erin told
Erin was on a field trip with her class to Mount Vernon, in Virginia. Mount Vernon was once Washington's home. Today, it includes a new museum about his life.
The museum features three life-size wax statues of the country's first president. One statue
or shows, Washington at age 19. Another shows him as a military leader at age 45. At that time, he led the American army that fought the British for our nation's
or freedom. The third statue shows Washington, at age 57, being sworn in as the first U.S. president.
or proof, from history to make the statues look real. They made a computer model of Washington using earlier statues and paintings. That helped the team show Washington at different ages. This will be the first Presidents' Day that the new statues are on display.
The statues are among the many exhibits at the new museum. Visitors can also watch a high-tech movie about Washington's life. Snow seems to fall inside the theater, and the seats shake with cannon fire. ""You feel that you are part of Washington's battles in the Revolutionary War,"" Mount Vernon education expert Ann Bay told
George Washington isn't the only famous U.S. president to come to life recently. The people who created the new museum at Mount Vernon were inspired by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. It is located in Springfield, Illinois. The Lincoln museum is home to a ""ghost library."" There, the use of special effects makes Lincoln (18091865), the 16th president, seem to appear in the room.

391,"In September, the United States government said it would send the ""Kennewick Man"" home. Kennewick Man is a 9,000-year-old skeleton found in 1996. Home for the ancient skeleton is near the Columbia River in the state of Washington. The Kennewick Man is known as the ""Ancient One"" to many Native American peoples. The groups believe the skeleton is the remains of one of their

38,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
Condoleezza Rice is making history. President George W. Bush chose her to be the secretary of state. Rice is the first African American woman to be selected for that job.
The job of secretary of state is very important. That person works with the governments of other countries. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world,"" said Bush. ""And in [Condoleezza Rice], the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country.""

764,"China is the only place in the world where giant pandas live in the wild.
Giant pandas have reason to celebrate! Until recently, scientists thought only about 1,600 were left in the wild. A recent study suggests that there may be as many as 3,000 giant pandas.

or home, is much smaller. It is being destroyed as people cut down trees for wood and farming.
Scientist Michael Bruford led the study. He told

603,"The hard work continues for U.S. troops in Iraq.
This month marks the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq. No one knows that better than Logan Jordan, 9, of Kailua, Hawaii. The third grader's father, Christopher, is a Marine. Christopher Jordan served in the war for two years. He will return to Iraq in September. Iraq is a country in the Middle East.

, or manage, itself. However, that is not an easy task. The country has three groups of people with different customs and interests. They are called Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. Each group wants to make sure it receives its fair share of power and resources in the new Iraq. Since the war began, more than 3,900 U.S. troops and thousands of Iraqis have died.
How long U.S. troops remain in Iraq will be a decision the next U.S. president will have to make when Bush leaves office in January. Until then, service members like Logan's father will continue their work. ""My dad is a brave man,"" Logan told

Iraq has the third-largest crude oil supply in the world. The country produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day.

409,"Pilots help whooping cranes find their way.
High in the sky, a flock of birds flies south. The birds are
. At about 5 feet tall, they are the tallest birds in North America.
The wild animals appear to be following larger birds. But those are not birds at all. They are people flying three-wheeled aircraft called
. The pilots are wearing white helmets and gowns.
That might sound like a birdbrained idea, but its not. The pilots are from an organization called Operation Migration. They are helping the whooping cranes learn to
To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change.
Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes dont know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes dont have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot.
Thats where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock.
It takes about three months for the birds to reach the Southwith plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special
or protected areas, in Florida. By then, the birds know how to migrate. This spring, birds that flew with the pilots last fall will return to the North on their own.
For Duff, the best part of the trip is bringing whooping cranes to the refuges. Its [a nice feeling] because you know the birds are going to make it, he told
Last fall, pilots in Wisconsin led a flock of whooping cranes across seven states. In Florida, the flock was divided and taken to two refuges. Study the map for a birds-eye view of their trip.

252,"Scientists find a pyramid buried in sand in Egypt.
Scientists digging in Egypt recently found a big surprisea pyramid! They uncovered the
, or very old, structure under 65 feet of sand. Egypt is a country in Africa.
There was so much sand dumped here that no one had any idea there was something buried underneath, says Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian
. That is a person who studies people and cultures of the past.
, or guesses, that the monument is 4,300 years old. It might be the burial place for an Egyptian queen named Sesheshet.
Sesheshets pyramid was bigger when it was built, experts say. It probably stood 45 feet tall, and each side was 72 feet long. Wind and sand have worn away the top of the pyramid. The remains are only 16 feet tall.
A worker cleans an ancient scene painted on one of the pyramids blocks.
Hawass and his team are busy digging to find more of the pyramid. They hope to get inside the structure to the
That is a room where a persons body was put after he or she died. Markings inside the room might say for sure who was buried there.
Scientists dont expect to find much else inside the burial chamber. That is because robbers most likely found the pyramid long ago. They probably took any gold or other treasures that were inside.
Still, finding the pyramid is important, scientists say. To find a new pyramid is always exciting, Hawass explains. And this one is magical. It belonged to a queen.
People have lived in Egypt for about 5,000 years. Early Egyptians invented forms of math and writing. They had the first national government.
The Sahara is the worlds largest desert. It covers most of the country. The Nile River runs through Egypt. It is the longest river in the world.
The Great Pyramid is the worlds largest pyramid. The Great Sphinx is located nearby. It has the body of a lion and the head of a human.

111,"A new report shows pythons are spreading.
Whats 23 feet long, as thick as a telephone pole, and slithering into a state near you? A Burmese python!
Pythons and other giant snakes are worming their way into Florida and other states. That is the finding of a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey. The species are not
to, or originally from, the area. They might have started out as pets that were set free. Many pythons are native to Asia.
Today, there are tens of thousands of pythons in Florida. They may one day creep into almost one-third of the United States, scientists say.
They [can move] long distances in a short period of time, scientist Gordon Rodda told
. He worked on the study. We had a python in Florida that in a few weeks ... traveled 30 miles.
. Those are groups of plants and animals that live in the same area. The snakes eat everything from birds to bobcats. They lie still until an animal comes near. Then the
strike. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals that often have scales.
U.S. officials are coming up with ways to stop the snakes. One idea is to
people from bringing pythons into the country. To ban is to prevent.
People in Florida move an 18-foot-long python to a safer home.
People who own pet snakes can help too, Rodda says. If you have a snake that gets too big for your home, take it to a zoo. We dont want to create a problem by [setting free] an animal we no longer want to take care of, says Rodda.
What makes giant snakes special? Wrap your head around these python facts to find out.
, or squeeze, prey? They loop their bodies around the prey and tighten their muscles to kill the animals. Then they swallow them.
Only alligators are tough enough to eat adult giant snakes. Dont feel bad for the snakes, though. They eat alligators!
Female pythons can lay up to 100 eggs at a time. The snakes stay on the eggs for two to three months to keep them warm until they hatch.
What are other ways U.S. officials could stop the snakes?

136,"The United States wrestling team is headed for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock will not be there. Instead, amateur athletes, such as Terry Brands and Cary Kolat, will go for Olympic gold.
The 2000 Summer Olym-pics will take place in Sydney, Australia.
Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the
, or slogan, of this year's Olympic wrestling team. The wrestlers use this motto because they are proud to wrestle for their country. They want people to know that the competition of Olympic wrestling is tougher than the professional wrestling of Mankind and Shane McMahon.
In the Olympic Games, there are two styles of wrestling,
. In Greco-Roman, wrestlers can use only their arms and upper body. In freestyle, wrestlers can use their legs to trip their opponent.
Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat.
Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling.
Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake.
U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes.
Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?

774,"When Dan Shaw and Cuddles go out, they attract quite a crowd. At first glance, Cuddles may look like a guide dog. But she is actually a miniature guide horse!
Cuddles and Shaw, who is blind, have been together since 2001. As a guide horse, Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he needs to go. Cuddles wears tiny sneakers that prevent her from slipping.

164,"Two girls in Sri Lanka walk past the rubble that was once their school. It was destroyed in the
(soo-NAH-mee), or series of huge waves, that hit South Asia in December.
The tsunami destroyed thousands of buildings, including homes, stores, and schools.
Since then, temporary schools have been set up in buildings that are still standing and in tents. The girls, along with thousands of other students, can now return to school.
""The opening of these schools is a powerful sign for people that life can begin again,"" said Carol Bellamy, the director of UNICEF. That is a group that helps children in need. UNICEF and other groups have donated thousands of tents and school supplies to countries affected by the tsunami.
A tsunami is usually caused by an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption. The recent tsunami smashed against the coasts of 12 countries in South Asia and East Africa. Tens of thousands of people were killed. Millions of others were left homeless.
This map shows the countries in South Asia and East Africa where the tsunami hit. They are shown in yellow.
Since the disaster, the world has reached out to help people rebuild their lives. Officials predict that it could take up to 10 years to help the region recover from the tsunami.
What are some other ways that schools can rebuild?
Returning to school is helping students focus on rebuilding their lives. ""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Bellamy.

707,"After years of protection, bald eagles and other endangered animals are making a comeback.
The future looks bright for some endangered animals! Thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists, many of these animals are doing well.
The bald eagle is one success story. The bird became the symbol of the United States in 1782. At that time, about 100,000 bald eagles lived in the lower 48 states. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs remained.
Hunting and loss of habitat contributed to the
or drop in number. However, the biggest threat came from DDT, a chemical used for farming. DDT made the birds eggshells so thin that chicks couldnt survive.
or not allowed. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was created. That law protects threatened plants and animals. Bald eagles soon gained protection under this law.
Today, there are more than 7,100 bald eagle nesting pairs in the lower 48 states. Plans are under way to take the birds off the endangered species list. If that happens, they will still be protected by other U.S. laws.
""It is a good endangered species success story,"" spokesperson Nicholas Throckmorton of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told
""Caring citizens have brought our national symbol back from the brink of extinction.""
The bald eagle isnt the only endangered species doing well. Here are some other success stories.
in and around Yellowstone National Park were endangered as a result of hunting and habitat loss. By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears lived in Yellowstone. Today, there are more than 600.
Scientists counted only 67 nesting females in 1973. Now the number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400.
of California were once killed by pollution and fishermen. In 1938, there were only 700 otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.

154,"Adriana Valencia has a new look--a short haircut! The fifth grader from Montrose, California, donated her long hair to Wigs for Kids. Wigs for Kids is a charity that helps children who have lost their hair because of illnesses.
recently talked to Adriana about her donation.
Adriana, what made you decide to donate your hair?
I grew my hair out to 12 inches. I wanted to do something for kids who had lost their hair. My cousin had leukemia, so I know what it's like for some kids [who lose their hair].
How can kids help other kids who have lost their hair besides by donating their own hair?
I think kids might get involved by learning more about cancer and seeing how it affects kids and their families.

487,"NASA wants to build an even better telescope than Hubble! It will be called the James Webb Space Telescope. James Webb was one of the people in charge of NASA.
In 2010, NASA is planning on sending the new telescope into space. A rocket will launch the telescope. It will take the rocket about three months to complete its journey.
The new telescope will be much farther from Earth than Hubble. Webb will take photos from 940,000 miles above Earth. That is about 700,000 miles farther than the moon! Scientists will use the new telescope to learn even more about the universe.

586,"Eagles and flamingos are invading Fernbank Elementary School in Decatur, Ga.! The animals are the names of some of the yoga poses students practice. Yoga is exercise that involves holding poses while breathing.
Students at the school have done yoga for more than two years. Teachers say it helps improve students' concentration and confidence. Teacher Janet Watson says yoga also helps her students deal with stress during tests. ""In between the different sections [of tests], we have them get up and do the [yoga] stretches,"" she told
Joshua, a third grader, likes the flamingo pose best. The move involves bending forward while extending one leg straight back. ""I love yoga because it is a very nice thing to do after working hard at school,"" Joshua told

369,"Why is this rain forest shrinking so quickly?
Bright-colored birds fly through the air. Monkeys leap from tree to tree. Jaguars creep on the ground below. Those are just a few of the thousands of animals that live in the Amazon rain forest.
The Amazon in South America is the largest
in the world. A tropical rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall.
People are destroying the Amazon. Each year, farmers and loggers cut down rain forest trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Scientists have recently discovered that the Amazon is shrinking twice as quickly as they once thought.
The Amazon rain forest is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant
or variety. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines people need come from the Amazon.
The Amazon rain forest also helps recycle Earths air. The trees give off oxygen for people to breathe. Trees also clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans.
Stopping people from destroying the rain forest is not an easy task. ""Almost 2 million people make the forest their home,"" scientist Jim Bowyer told
""All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive. Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest.""
April 22 is Earth Day. How can you help protect our planet?
Rain forest trees stay green all year long.
The tallest trees may grow up to 200 feet!

446,"Katie Stagliano (below) wants to make sure no one goes to bed hungry. And shes achieving that goal one vegetable at a time. The fifth grader from Summerville, South Carolina, started Katies Krops. That is a group that grows vegetables to give to people in need.
Katies Krops took root two years ago when Katie received a cabbage seedling in her third-grade class. Katie planted her seedling in her yard. It grew into a 40-pound cabbage!
Katie decided to donate the giant cabbage to a
A soup kitchen is a place that gives food to people who cannot afford it. When Katie saw all the people who depended on the soup kitchen for their meals, she knew she wanted to do more to help. Thats when she thought of Katies Krops.

728,"The Hispanic American population tops 50 million.
eres looking at you! The countrys population is becoming bigger and more
or different, than ever before. There are now more than 308 million people
or living, in the United States. Many of them come from different countries and backgrounds.
More than 50 million of those people are
Those are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Only about 35 million Hispanic Americans lived in the United States 10 years ago.
The new numbers are from the nations
That is an official count of a countrys population. The U.S. census takes place every 10 years. U.S. officials recently announced the 2010 census results.
The Asian American population grew the fastest of all races, the count showed. That group increased by 43 percent from 2000 to 2010. There are now about 14.7 million Asian Americans in the nation.
Kids are a big reason the country is getting more diverse, officials say. Nearly half of all children [are] something other than non-Hispanic white, Stacy Vidal told
She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Census Bureau.
The census didnt just track who lives in the United States. It also showed
people live. California, New York, and Texas still have the biggest populations. About one-fourth of Americans live in those three states, the count found.
States in the South and West saw most of the population growth over the past 10 years. Nevadas population grew the fastest. It went up by 35 percent since 2000.
The census can teach us a lot about the United States, Vidal says. It paints a picture of who we are as a nation.
The United States has seen a big jump in the Hispanic American population over the past 40 years. This graph shows how that groups numbers have grown. What do you think its population will be in 2020? Why?
Why might U.S. officials want to know how many people live in the country?

557,"A rocket, with the orbiter on top, was launched in August from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
A spacecraft speeds toward the Red Planet. Scientists hope the trip will lead to answers.
In many books and movies, little green aliens from Mars invade Earth. In real life, Mars is the planet being invadedby strange-looking machines from Earth.
In August, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched a spacecraft to Mars. It is called an orbiter because it will
, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March.
The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water.
Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars.
The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars.
This is an artists depiction of the spacecraft as it nears Mars.
""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told
. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined.""
Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a reddish color.
Like Earth, Mars has mountains and valleys.
The largest volcano in the solar system, called Olympus Mons, is on Mars.
Even in the summer, the temperature on the planet's surface is below zero.

301,"Would you believe a nickel could be worth a million dollars? That's how much a coin dealer recently offered to pay for one.
The coin is rare. It's a 1913 Liberty Head nickel. Only five of them were made at the U.S. Mint. The nickel had been missing for more than 40 years.
The last owner of the nickel was a man from North Carolina. When he died in 1962, he left the rare coin to his family. However, they thought it was a fake and kept it in a closet.
A few months ago, the coin dealer announced a million-dollar reward for the nickel. That's when the family took it to the dealer and learned it was the real thing!
The family decided not to sell the nickel right away. If they do sell it, experts say the coin could go for more than 2 million dollars. ""It's like holding a winning lottery ticket,"" said the coin dealer.

492,"You turn on the TV and see your favorite cartoon character. But wait a minutethats not a show; it is a commercial for junk food!
Cartoon characters are being used to sell junk foods on TV. How does that affect you?
Thats wrong, says the Institute of Medicine, which advises the nation on health issues. The group says that kid-friendly characters should promote only foods that are good for you.
The group recently reported that food ads on TV have astrong influence on what kids under the age of 12 eat. ""Our eating habits and preferences form early in our lives,"" the groups spokesperson, Christine Stencel, told
Advertisers know kids have spending power. ""American kids spend about $200 billion each year. Foods high in sugar and fat are among the top 10 items,"" says Stencel. ""Kids also influence what their parents buy.""
Junk foods such as candy bars, sugared cereals, and potato chips are high in
A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy a food can provide. The body needs food as fuel. However, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity.
Millions of people in the United States are
or severely overweight. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems.
""The committee thinks it is time people should take steps to reduce the problem of obesity,"" says Stencel. ""That includes making changes in what foods are marketed to kids and how they are promoted.""
Foods that are high in nutrition help people stay healthy. Good choices:
foods with whole grains, such as whole-wheat breads and pastas
a variety of fruits and vegetables in a rainbow of colors
calcium-rich, nonfat or low-fat foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt
What are some other ways advertisers get kids to buy their products?

275,"One kissed a yak. One jumped from a plane. One ate fried worms. Do you think thats insane? Possibly, but it was all for a need. School principals were challenging students to read!
Those crazy stunts by school principals were all for Read Across America Day. The celebration takes place each year on March 2. That date is the birthday of childrens book author Dr. Seuss (19041991). Millions of kids have learned to read through his silly and clever rhymes.

failure. A power grid is a system that controls the flow of electricity. In many places, the electricity was out for 48 hours.

President George W. Bush called the power failure a ""wake-up call."" He said that the power system is old and needs to be fixed.
Officials are trying to come up with ways to solve the problem. One idea is to build new power lines. Another idea is to update the old system. The goal is the same: to prevent future blackouts.

619,"On April 22, millions of people around the world will celebrate Earth Day. People are finding many ways-from inventions to projects-to help protect the environment. Look inside to find out how they are working to make a difference.
Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.
Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

713,"Mexico's ""Volcano of Fire"" roars back to life. When will the next big explosion occur?
The Colima (koh-LEE-mah) Volcano in Mexico has roared to life again. The 12,500-foot volcano is also called the ""Volcano of Fire."" Over the past few months, its eruptions have been larger and more frequent. It has been shooting hot gas and ash high into the sky.
The Volcano of Fire is Mexico's most
volcano. It has erupted many times over the years. What scientists are most worried about is the next big eruption. The volcano has had huge eruptions about every hundred years. The last one took place in 1913.
Scientists have noticed a pattern in recent activity that is very much like the pattern before the 1913 eruption. ""Most scientists are expecting a large, explosive eruption in the next 10 years or so,"" volcano expert Jim Luhr told
The volcano is 20 miles north of the city of Colima. To make sure no one is in danger, officials created a safety zone around the volcano. People aren't allowed in that area.
Scientists use special equipment to track changes within the volcano. ""We're looking for clues of another large, explosive eruption,"" says Luhr. ""That way, we can be prepared.""

740,"Veterans visit classrooms across the country to talk with students.
When Christopher Bain visits schools, he shows students his Army uniform. He also talks to them about the American flag and what it
who lives in Williamsport, Pa. A veteran is a person who has served in the U.S. armed forces. November 11 is
, a day when Americans honor veterans. There are almost 25 million U.S. veterans living today.
Bain is just one of many veterans who visits with students. Now a new program is helping to connect more students with veterans like Bain. It is called Take a Veteran to School Day. The program was created by the History Channel. It encourages schools to invite veterans to speak to students of all ages. Representatives from the History Channel say it's important that students know veterans.
One school to get on board with the program was Steven G. Schorr Elementary School in Las Vegas, Nev. That's where the Take a Veteran to School Day program was announced in May. Third graders met several veterans at the event. Jennifer Rowland is a teacher at the school. ""My students were really able to grasp the meaning and importance of Veterans Day by meeting an actual veteran,"" she told
. ""They loved trying on and touching an actual [military] helmet!""
Veterans get a lot out of the experience too. Bain served in the Iraq war. ""I tell [students] a little bit about my story,"" he told
. ""I wanted to serve my country so I can keep [Americans'] way of life and keep the freedoms that we have.""
Nearly 2 million U.S. veterans are women.
The country's oldest and largest Veterans Day parade is held in Birmingham, Ala.
In 1968, Congress passed a law to move Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October. The holiday was switched back to November 11 in 1978.
Men and women are not the only military heroesdogs can be veterans too! Dogs, such as German shepherds, began serving in the U.S. armed forces in the 1940s. Today they continue to assist soldiers. Military dogs
, or guard, areas and sniff out bombs and traps.
What can kids learn by listening to U.S. veterans talk about their experiences?

379,"Park rangers bring Mesa Verdes history to light.
Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
Put on your party hat. This year, Mesa Verde (MAY-suh VEHR-day) National Park in Colorado has reason to celebrate. A century ago this past summer, the U.S. government set aside the land as a national park. (A century is 100 years.) The park protects the site of an ancient Native American city.
All year, the park has celebrated with special events. They included tours of the cliff homes and Native American dances, music, and stories.
(fuh-NA-lee), or big ending, of the celebration. On that night, park rangers will light up two of the largest cliff homes with about 100 lanterns.
The celebration honors the Native American tribe that built Mesa Verde. The tribe is called the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh). They are the
of todays Pueblo people. An ancestor is a family member who lived a long time ago.
The Ancient Pueblo lived in the area from about 600 to 1300. They lived on the
top until the 1100s. A mesa is a large, high rock with a flat top and steep sides. Later, they moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told
""It provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
The park protects more than 600 ancient cliff homes. The two largest homes contain about 160 rooms each.
By 1100, the cliff homes were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.

291,"What does it take to blast to the top? Patrick Sullivan knows! The sixth grader (below) from Orlando, Florida, recently received a Student Publishing Contest award from Weekly Reader. His essay about NASAs space shuttle program earned him a top prize. NASA is the U.S. space agency. I was thrilled [when I found out I won], Patrick told
work. Nonfiction is writing that is true. The contest is open to individual students in grades 3 through 12 and school newspapers. Prizes include $500 and a trip to Washington, D.C.

640,"Lily Thorpe from Colorado is one busy 11-year-old! She recently started a group called Kids Campaign. Lily meets with
and speaks with them about kids' causes. (Elected officials are people who are voted into office.)
Why did Lily start Kids Campaign? She noticed that many of her school library books were very old. To help schools in Colorado get money for books and other supplies they need, she decided to take action.
In the name of children everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard. ""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told

682,"Attention, Barbie and Elmo: It's time to muscle up! The U.S. Congress is considering a bill to strengthen toy safety laws. Millions of toys were
last year in the United States. To recall is to ask people to return something they already bought.
Sixty-one different types of toys were recalled last year. Some toys were made with poisonous lead paint. Others had breakable parts that could be swallowed accidentally. The toys were
, or made, in China for U.S. companies. China is a country in Asia.
The new laws would reduce the amount of lead allowed in toys. There would also be more safety tests for toys.

676,"Elena Kagan is a new Supreme Court judge.
All rise! Theres a new judge in town. On October 4, Elena Kagan will start her first day as a U.S. Supreme Court
A justice is a judge. The Supreme Court is the countrys highest court.
She is only the fourth female Supreme Court justice in history. This is the first time the Court will have three women justices at the same time.
Steve Petteway/Collection of the Supreme Court of the U.S.
Elena Kagan is sworn in as a justice in Washington, D.C.
Kagan grew up in New York City. She dreamed of being a judge. Her dream started to come true in May. Thats when U.S. President Barack Obama picked her to become a justice.
Before she could join the Court, she had to meet with U.S. senators. They asked her questions. Then they voted on whether she should become a justice. A
or most, of the senators agreed she should.
In her new role, Kagan will work with eight other Supreme Court justices. They
or explain, the U.S. Constitution. That document says how the nation should be run. The justices must decide whether laws follow the Constitutions rules.
Kagan is studying cases that the Court will hear next month. She is excited about her job. I will work my hardest and try my best ... to serve this country I love as well as I am able,she says.
The U.S. government isnt a tree, but it does have branches! Each branch does a different job.
The U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives make up this branch. Their job is to create laws.
The president and vice president are in this branch. The president carries out laws and leads the U.S. military.
The U.S. Supreme Court runs this branch. Its duty is to make sure laws follow the U.S. Constitution.
Supreme Court justices can serve as long as they want. Why might that be?

232,"How many U.S. landmarks can you name?
are buildings or places that are well-known. They are symbols of our country. Lets explore some of them!
The Statue of Liberty is in New York, New York. It is located on Liberty Island. People can visit the statue by taking a
to the island. A ferry is a boat used to carry passengers.
The statue was a gift of friendship from the people of France. It was shipped to the United States in 350 pieces. The statue was rebuilt. It was completed in 1886.
The Gateway Arch is in St. Louis, Missouri. It was completed in 1965. The arch is 630 feet tall. Visitors can ride a
to the top. A tram is a car that travels on overhead cables.
The arch was built to look like a
or entrance, to the West. It honors American
who traveled west across the United States long ago. Pioneers are people who are among the first to settle in new places.
The Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, California. It opened in 1937. It is a suspension bridge. That means the roadway hangs from cables. The cables are connected to towers. People can cross the bridge by car, by bicycle, or on foot.
The bridge is almost 9,000 feet long It crosses the Golden Gate Strait. A
is a narrow channel of water that connects two large bodies of water.
The Liberty Bell is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was made in 1753. The bell weighs about 2,000 pounds. It was rung to call people together for special events and announcements.
Soon after the bell was made, it cracked. People tried to fix the bell, but it cracked again. The bell has not been rung since then. It now hangs in a museum. Many people visit the bell to see the crack that made it famous.
If you were asked to create a new landmark for our country, what would it be? Why?

244,"Arthur the aardvark will celebrate his 25th birthday later this month. To readers, Arthur will always be 8 years old. But Marc Brown has been writing and drawing the Arthur books for 25 years.
talked to Marc Brown about his work. Here's what he had to say.
Telling bedtime stories to my son was one of my favorite things to do. So I decided to write and draw kids' books.
Why did you decide to write about an aardvark?
My son wanted to hear a story about a weird animal.
How do you decide what each book will be about?
I try to make the stories fun to read. But I also write about things that are important to kids.
Did you have a favorite book as a kid?
Do you have any advice for a kid who wants to become a writer?

393,"Casey Martin is a professional golfer. But Martin has a disease that makes walking painful for him. So he would like to ride in a golf cart between shots during golf games.
Members of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) think it would be unfair to let Martin ride in a cart. They say that part of the competition in a golf match is walking the golf course. Some matches last four days, and players walk about 25 miles.
Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether Martin can use a golf cart. The Supreme Court is the most important court in the United States. In January, the justices of the Court listened to what Martin and the PGA had to say about using the golf cart. The Court plans to make a decision by July.

198,"Learn about a woman who followed her dream
Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A
is a small bird that is usually yellow.
Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.
What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?

594,"Can you imagine a pizza box that turns into serving plates? a fan without spinning blades? a garden growing on a wall? Well, get ready to learn about those great
! Inventions are new things. They can solve problems and make life easier.
The Green Box is a pizza box that can be
means to use again. That makes less trash. The top half of the box divides into four plates. People dont need paper plates. The bottom of the box folds in half and can be used to hold leftovers.
Cameron, age 6, holds the Green Box.
A man named William Walsh invented the Green Box. His friends often ate pizza, but they never used plates. One day, a friend spilled hot cheese on his shirt. Walsh tore off a piece of the box and gave it to him to use as a plate. What a good idea!
The electric fan was invented more than 120 years ago. It has blades that spin and move the air. A company called Dyson has invented a new type of fan. It is called the Air Multiplier. The new fan does not have blades. It is safer to use and can be easily cleaned.
How does a fan without blades move air? It has a motor that pulls air in through holes in the bottom of the fan. The air is pushed out over a circle-shaped ramp. It lets out a stream of air. Cool!
How does your garden grow? Gardens by Patrick Blanc climb the walls. They are called
means straight up and down. The gardens grow on buildings around the world. One of his newest gardens is growing on a hotel in London, England. It has about 260 types of plants.
Blancs gardens are unusual. The plants do not grow in soil. Their roots are attached to a type of cloth called felt. Water is pumped through the garden to keep plants healthy.

377,"Lighters are not toys. Some lighters are made to look like toys, though. They are dangerous. Kids have played with them and started fires. Some kids have gotten hurt.
This may look like a toy, but it is not a toy.
Fire officials want to keep kids safe. They want states to
the sale of the lighters. To ban is to stop with a rule or a law. Maine became the first state to pass such a law, in 2008. Since then, about 13 other states have done the same.
Lighters should only be handled by adults, says Tom Olshanski. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Fire Administration. That group focuses on fire safety. Fire burns, he says. We will continue to work until all 50 states ban the sale of these lighters.
This lighter looks like a cell phone. How might that be a danger to people?

269,"The Pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock, December 1620.
landed at the place that is now Massachusetts. There were 101 Pilgrims aboard the ship. After some time, the Pilgrims built a town called Plymouth. Read below to learn more.
The Pilgrims landed near the area where the Wampanoag (wahm-pah-NOH-ahg) people already lived. The Wampanoag people knew how to stay safe during cold winters. They made homes called
(weh-TOOZ) to protect themselves from the cold. They also made warm clothing from deerskin.
The Pilgrims arrived close to wintertime. That winter was very cold, and many Pilgrims died. When spring came, a Wampanoag man named Squanto helped the Pilgrims. He showed them where to hunt, and he taught them how to grow corn. This helped the Pilgrims get food to eat.
When the fall harvest came, the Pilgrims had plenty of food to eat! They were very thankful for Squanto's help. Together, the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people had a harvest celebration. For three days, people ate, played games, and told stories to celebrate and give thanks.

That harvest celebration helped start the American tradition of Thanksgiving. Today, people still share food with their families and friends on this holiday. People also play games, tell stories, and spend time together to show they are thankful. Many people travel to be together on Thanksgiving too.

247,"Scientists recently studied black bears in Alaska. The bears hibernated for about six months. During that time, the bears breathing slowed down. Their heartbeats slowed too.
What barely changed? The bears body temperature! It dropped only a few degrees. That surprised scientists. Most animals that hibernate have a large drop in temperature.
As body temperature drops, the body slows down and uses less energy. It was surprising that hibernating bears were able to save so much energy without a large drop in body temperature, says Oivind Toien. He is the scientist who led the study.

87,"Rain forests are in trouble. They are disappearing. For many years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads.
Many groups are working to save rain forests. The forests are home to half the worlds plant and animal
, or types. Many of those species are in danger of dying out.
We have lost almost all of our worlds tropical rain forests, says Ashley Schaeffer. She is a spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network. That group is working to protect rain forests. Unless we take action now, they will all be gone, she says. We are working with large companies to get them to stop cutting down trees.
Farmers have destroyed a large area of this tropical rain forest.

324,"George Washingtons old home is getting a makeover. The home is in Virginia. It is called Mount Vernon. The home will be improved to help people with disabilities tour it.
George Washingtons Mount Vernon home will be improved so people with disabilities can visit it.
The home will have ramps for people who use wheelchairs. People who cant hear will be able to take sign language tours.
tours will be given for people who cant see. Audio is sound.

69,"How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know.
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working.
Fire can spread quickly. Every family needs to be prepared. How? Have a home fire escape plan. Draw the plan and talk about it. The drawing should show two ways out of each room. Those may be doors or windows. Then practice the plan twice a year. Practice during the day and at night.
Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building.
Once you are outside, dial 9-1-1 or the number for your fire department.
Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?

370,"Schools across the country are trying to protect kids from getting hurt by heavy backpacks. Researchers say heavy backpacks can hurt kids' backs and cause kids to fall down.
Some schools are giving students two sets of textbooks. Students keep one set in school, and they leave the other set at home. That way, kids don't have to carry books back and forth every day.

123,"May is Bike Safety Month. During this month, many communities will have activities to teach kids about bike safety. Events often include safety classes and helmet fittings.
Why is it important that your helmet fit well? If it does not fit, it wont protect your head. To work properly, a helmet should be straight on your head and fit snugly. If a helmet is too loose, it can slip to one side.
Riding a bike is a lot of fun, but remember that safety comes first, says Dr. Jamie Freishtat. She is a childrens doctor and a spokesperson for Safe Kids.

202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.

428,"Kids are helping keep track of monarchs. The kids are putting tags on the butterflies. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found.
Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. Scientists want to learn more about monarchs so they can save them.

294,"Nobody likes being bullied. Learn more about the problem and how you can help stop it.
Bullying is not a one-time problem. It is hurting someone over and over again. It can include teasing and threats. It can take the form of hitting and pushing. Kids who are bullied often feel scared or hurt.
If the answer is yes, think about why you acted that way. It is not right to make others feel bad. Say you are sorry to the person you bullied. Talk to an adult if you need help to stop bullying others.
What should you do if you are being bullied?
If you are being bullied, speak up. Tell the bully to stop. Then walk away. You should also talk to an adult.
What are schools doing to stop bullying?
Kids, parents, and teachers are working together to stop bullying. Some schools have programs that teach kids to talk about and solve their problems. Many states also have laws against bullying.
What might you do to help someone who is being bullied?

and the chicken have in common? A team of scientists say the two animals are related. Recently, the scientists studied a
of that. Proof is anything that can be used to show that something is true.
bone was part of a dinosaur's leg. It is 68 million years old. Scientists found it in Montana in 2003. They cut into the bone and were surprised to find
inside. Protein is a living material that makes up muscle. It is also found inside bone.
Lewis Cantley is a scientist on the research team. ""We were very excited,"" he says. ""No one thought that protein could survive that long.""
Scientists used a special machine to study the protein. They compared it to the proteins in other animals. Chickens were the closest relatives.
Many scientists have long thought that dinosaurs and birds are related. The recent discovery is more proof. ""Previous proof was based on the way the bones looked. This proof is based on protein,"" says Cantley. ""It better supports our beliefs that chickens came from dinosaurs.""
This year, scientists plan to look for more dinosaur bones to study. ""We want to find other dinosaur bones that contain protein,"" says Cantley. ""That would give us even more proof.""
and the chicken were the same size. Would they look related? Take a look at the photos to see for yourself. How are they alike? How are they different?

about 18 feet (or about 17 chickens)
about 40 feet (or about 37 chickens)

Why might people want to learn more about dinosaurs?

75,"A big hurricane hit the United States in 2005. It was called Hurricane Katrina. That hurricane caused a lot of damage to homes and schools in New Orleans, a city in Louisiana.
A new school is opening in New Orleans this fall. It is Langston Hughes Academy Charter School.
John Alford is in charge of the company that is managing the school. It is the first new public school in New Orleans since the storm, he says. We are going to be better than we were before the storm!
John Alford and students in New Orleans are excited about the opening of a new school.

226,"Hurricanes are big storms. They bring lots of rain and strong winds. Most hurricanes happen in places near oceans. Hurricane season is from June to November.
Why might it be important to stay away from windows during a hurricane?
. The eye of a hurricane is the calm center of the storm. The storm clouds move around the eye. A lot of rain and strong winds are found inside storm clouds.
Hurricane winds spin around and around. In very strong hurricanes, the winds can blow more than 155 miles per hour. Hurricane winds can harm houses and trees. Those winds can also pick up cars and boats.

549,"Watch what you drink! Dentists say that soft drinks and fruit juices are bad for kids teeth. Those drinks are high in acid. The acid wears away tooth
That is the hard covering on a tooth.
If you drink a soft drink or fruit juice, use a straw. Dentists say that will help keep the acid away from your teeth.

366,"In 1909, explorer Matthew Henson was one of the first people to reach the North Pole on foot. Henson, an African American, was honored by the National Geographic Society last fall. The society gave Henson's family the Hubbard Medal, which is the society's highest honor.
Henson was an expert sled dog handler. He also learned to speak Inuit, the language spoken by people living near the North Pole.

527,"A Long Winter Sleep: How Do Animals Hibernate?
Many animals hibernate (HIGH-behr-nayt) during the winter. When an animal hibernates, it goes into a deep sleep. Animals hibernate when the weather gets cold and it is hard to find food. Animals like frogs, chipmunks, and bears hibernate.
In the fall, brown bears eat a lot of food. They eat berries, plants, and fish. Bears eat to build up fat. By the end of the fall, the bears start to hibernate in dens, which are caves or openings in the ground. They breathe slower and their hearts beat slower. They don't need to eat or drink because they use their fat to stay alive.
When fall comes, a chipmunk gathers extra food. It stores the extra food in its
, or hole in the ground. The chipmunk hibernates in its burrow for the winter. Sometimes, a hibernating chipmunk wakes up. It wakes up to eat some of its stored food. It eats berries, mushrooms, and nuts.
Some frogs hibernate in mud at the bottom of lakes or rivers. As they hibernate, they are very still and seem to be frozen. Frogs that hibernate take in oxygen from the water.

A brown bear can be about 5 feet tall while standing on all four feet.
A brown bear can run up to 30 miles per hour.
A baby brown bear can weigh less than 1 pound when it is born.

5,"Some ants live in special plants known as ant plants. Those plants have
parts where the ants can live. Something that is hollow has empty space inside. The ants help the plants by killing insects that eat the plants.
Scientists recently found that some ants can harm plants. The ants attack plants that do not have hollow parts. The ants dig tunnels in the plants to make nests. Why? Scientists say that when the ants run out of space in ant plants, they make room in other plants.

127,"Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean.
Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean.
Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid.
The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery.
What Does a Giant Squid Look Like?
A giant squid has eight arms and two
. A tentacle is like an arm, except it is much longer.
A giant squid can be 60 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds.
A giant squid has huge eyes, as big as a kid's head.
A giant squid has a beak that looks somewhat like a parrot's beak.
Debra Ingrao works at Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. Last year, Debra flew to New Zealand to bring back a dead giant squid to study. She talked to
I love the ocean and want to learn more about the sea animals living in it.
What do you love most about your job?
I enjoy studying sea animals in their natural habitats. [A
is the place where an animal lives.]
Why is studying the giant squid important?
Everything we learn helps us understand the deep sea better.
Should we be afraid of the giant squid?
Its large size is scary! But giant squids don't live where people swim.
What does a giant squid's skin feel like?
The skin is very smooth and a bit slimy.
Do you want to go on a search for a living giant squid in the future?
