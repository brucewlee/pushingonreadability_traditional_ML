0,586,"On most days, you may see clouds in the sky. Where do they come from? When the sun heats oceans and lakes, water changes from a liquid to a gas. It rises into the air and cools. As it cools, the gas changes back into a liquid. It forms tiny drops of water or ice crystals. As they come together, they become clouds.
Clouds come in different shapes. Each shape is a clue to the kind of weather that is on the way. Learn about four kinds of clouds.
(SIHR-uhss) clouds are thin and wispy. They look like hairs. They are found high in the sky. Cirrus clouds can bring a change in the weather.
(KYOO-myuh-luhss) clouds are big and fluffy. They may look like cotton balls. They usually form low in the sky. Cumulus clouds often bring sunny, fair weather.
(STRAH-tuhss) clouds are long layers of clouds. They look like a blanket. They are low in the sky. Stratus clouds can bring light rain.
(kyoo-myuh-loh-NIM-buhss) clouds are big and gray. They are a kind of cumulus cloud. They can start near the ground and be very tall in the sky. Cumulonimbus clouds can bring heavy rain and thunderstorms. They also may mean a
is on the way. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind.

4,570,"So much traffic is zipping around Earths
. An orbit is a path a space object travels around another object. Scientists have to keep an eye on all that traffic to make sure it flows smoothly.
People have sent hundreds of satellites into Earths orbit. A satellite is an object that orbits a planet. Some travel as close as 100 miles above Earth. Others are thousands of miles away. The satellites have different jobs. Some track the weather. Others send signals to radios, televisions, cell phones, and computers.
The Hubble Space Telescope is a well-known satellite. It was launched into space in 1990. It is in orbit 380 miles above Earth. Hubble takes photos of our solar system and faraway
. A galaxy is a huge group of stars, dust, and gas. Over the years, Hubble has taught scientists a lot about space.
The International Space Station is a special type of satellite. It is a giant research lab in space where astronauts live and work. The station is in orbit 220 miles above Earth.

9,27,"Fire Prevention Week is from October 3 to 9. That is a time for kids and their families to learn about fire safety. Here are some tips to stay safe:
Have working smoke alarms in your home. Test them once a month.
Stay away from matches, lighters, and stoves.
Practice a fire escape plan with your family. Choose a place outside where you will meet if your house were to catch fire.
If a fire starts, get out and stay out.
Stop, drop, and roll if your clothes catch fire.
Make sure your smoke alarms work by testing them once a month.

15,408,"April 22 is Earth Day. That day reminds everyone to take care of Earth, our home. Many of Earth's animals are in danger of losing their homes. The pika (PEE-kah) is an animal whose habitat is in danger. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives.
Earth's temperature is rising, and people are using land where animals live.
are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains.
make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests.
live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live.
live in the grasslands of Asia. Their habitat is shrinking because people are building towns in places that used to belong to the tigers. Now these big cats have fewer grassland areas to call home.
Tigers are among the animals losing places to live.
Scientists say Earth is getting warmer because of pollution in the air. They are working to protect animal habitats.
Take short showers to save water and energy.
Dispose of trash properly. Recycle plastic, glass, paper, and metal.
Turn off electrical appliances when you are not using them.

21,198,"Learn about a woman who followed her dream
Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot.
Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats.
Amelia Earhart sits at the controls of her airplane.
In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A
is a small bird that is usually yellow.
Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly
A crowd cheers for Amelia Earhart after she flies solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a mans activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly.
In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel.
Amelia Earhart wore a helmet and goggles when she flew.
Over the years, many people have tried to find Earharts airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery.
A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew.
Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before, says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country.
An Amelia Earhart balloon takes its first flight in a parade in Indiana.
Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? She is a great role model for young girls, says Long. She was fearless. We want young girls to say, Hey, I can do anything!
The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. Our hope is to make one each year, Long says.
What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?

44,536,"A Grand View of the Grand Canyon
Soon visitors to the Grand Canyon in Arizona will be able to step out onto a glass walkway to get a better view of one of the world's most beautiful canyons.
is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon was cut into Earth over millions of years by the waters of the Colorado River.
The new walkway, called the Skywalk, is on the west
or edge, of the canyon. It juts out 70 feet. When it officially opens, visitors will be able to look down at deep rock formations.
The walkway was built on land owned by a Native American tribe called the Hualapai (WAH-luh-pigh). They want to attract more people to the west rim. ""It's a whole new way to experience the Grand Canyon,"" says spokesperson Sheri Yellowhawk.

53,242,"People in the United States will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 15. That day is King's birthday. He will be honored for the important work he did. Soon, a monument will be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King.
A Memorial for Martin Luther King Jr.
will soon be built for Martin Luther King. A memorial is a special statue or place meant to remind people of a person or event. The memorial will honor the work King did for all Americans.
The memorial will sit on the shore of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. It will cover an area of land about the size of three football fields. Visitors will be able to walk along a path lined with large stone panels. Each panel will show words from King's important speeches. There will also be a 20-foot-high stone statue of King.
Workers will probably begin building the memorial this year. They plan to finish the memorial in 2003.
On August 28, 1963, King gave an important speech in Washington, D.C., to more than 200,000 people. King asked that all people be treated
or the same. That speech is often called the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
For many years, African Americans were not treated equally in the United States. King worked hard to solve that problem. He told people to work out their problems by talking, not fighting.

54,594,"Can you imagine a pizza box that turns into serving plates? a fan without spinning blades? a garden growing on a wall? Well, get ready to learn about those great
! Inventions are new things. They can solve problems and make life easier.
The Green Box is a pizza box that can be
means to use again. That makes less trash. The top half of the box divides into four plates. People dont need paper plates. The bottom of the box folds in half and can be used to hold leftovers.
Cameron, age 6, holds the Green Box.
A man named William Walsh invented the Green Box. His friends often ate pizza, but they never used plates. One day, a friend spilled hot cheese on his shirt. Walsh tore off a piece of the box and gave it to him to use as a plate. What a good idea!
The electric fan was invented more than 120 years ago. It has blades that spin and move the air. A company called Dyson has invented a new type of fan. It is called the Air Multiplier. The new fan does not have blades. It is safer to use and can be easily cleaned.
How does a fan without blades move air? It has a motor that pulls air in through holes in the bottom of the fan. The air is pushed out over a circle-shaped ramp. It lets out a stream of air. Cool!
How does your garden grow? Gardens by Patrick Blanc climb the walls. They are called
means straight up and down. The gardens grow on buildings around the world. One of his newest gardens is growing on a hotel in London, England. It has about 260 types of plants.
Blancs gardens are unusual. The plants do not grow in soil. Their roots are attached to a type of cloth called felt. Water is pumped through the garden to keep plants healthy.

National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
Brush your teeth twice a day. Brush all parts of your mouth and even your tongue. Brush with short, back-and-forth motions. Don't forget to be gentle!
Floss your teeth once a day. Dental floss cleans between your teeth. Use it to remove food you missed with a toothbrush.
Visit the dentist twice a year. Your dentist will check and clean your teeth, take X-rays, and put
on your teeth. Fluoride helps keep your teeth strong.

63,163,"What lives in the oceans? Scientists are trying to find out. They recently finished a 10-year study. It is called the Census of Marine Life. A
More than 2,000 scientists worked on the census. They explored all parts of the oceans. They discovered many new kinds of animals. Most of those animals live in the deepest parts of the oceans. Those areas had not been explored much until now.
The census is just the beginning. The ocean is simply so vast that, after 10 years of hard work, we still have only snapshots, though sometimes detailed, of what the sea contains. But it is an important and impressive start, says Nancy Knowlton. She is a scientist who worked on the census.
This deep-sea creature has a yellow stomach that reaches out to feed all parts of its body.

66,377,"Lighters are not toys. Some lighters are made to look like toys, though. They are dangerous. Kids have played with them and started fires. Some kids have gotten hurt.
This may look like a toy, but it is not a toy.
Fire officials want to keep kids safe. They want states to
the sale of the lighters. To ban is to stop with a rule or a law. Maine became the first state to pass such a law, in 2008. Since then, about 13 other states have done the same.
Lighters should only be handled by adults, says Tom Olshanski. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Fire Administration. That group focuses on fire safety. Fire burns, he says. We will continue to work until all 50 states ban the sale of these lighters.

67,16,"More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didnt contain as much life as warmer waters.
A diver studies ocean animals near the cold South Pole.
How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole, says scientist David Barnes.
Why might it be useful for scientists to know which types of ocean animals live near the South Pole?

69,256,"Do you have a fire escape plan?
That is the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week. It lasts from October 7 to 13. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) plans the week to teach kids and their families about fire safety.
The NFPA wants to sound the alarm about the need for a home fire escape plan. They want people across the country to practice their fire escape plans this month. The group is calling the project the Great American Fire Drill.
Only one out of four Americans has planned and practiced a fire escape plan, says the NFPA. ""It's important for everyone in your family to know how to escape in case of a fire,"" says NFPA spokesperson Judy Comoletti.
Why is it important to practice a fire escape plan?

70,197,"Some people fly airplanes into hurricanes! That is what Chad Gibson does. He is a member of a group called Hurricane Hunters.
Hurricane Hunters measure the storms wind speed and strength. Scientists use that information to predict when and where a hurricane is going to hit land.
What is it like to fly into a hurricane? There are times when you just see the clouds, says Gibson. You really cant see anything else.

74,202,"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
. That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's as Easy as One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart.

77,622,"Our national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Did you know that the song is about a 200-year-old flag? Workers from a museum in Washington, D.C., are trying to make the flag look new again.
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag.
The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches!
Next, the flag's holes will be patched. The project will be finished in 2002.

78,452,"Scientists in California recently explored a large inactive, underwater volcano. They were looking for ways to protect this special sea mountain that is home to many animals. Bright yellow sea sponges and 10-foot-tall pink coral live there. It is located deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Its name is Davidson Seamount. The rocks there make good homes for deep-sea animals.
Scientists used a remote control vehicle to help them explore the volcano. It took photos and collected bits of rock and coral. Scientists say that we must find ways to protect this place or we will lose these sea creatures forever.

81,542,"Scientists have identified a new dinosaur. It is the smallest dinosaur yet to be found in North America. The dinosaur was smaller than a house cat.
This drawing shows what the tiny dinosaur may have looked like.
The tiny dinosaur had very sharp claws and teeth. It was a carnivore. Scientists say it most likely hunted insects and small animals.
The dinosaurs fossils were actually found almost 30 years ago. They were put in a drawer for safekeeping. A scientist took the fossils out a few years ago. He decided to study them. That led him to make the discovery.

85,516,"lived millions of years ago. Scientists recently discovered something new about dinosaurs.
Scientists stumbled upon strange-looking dinosaur bones in Germany.
that are unlike any they had seen before. Fossils are remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. This is what scientists found:
The fossils were from a sauropod (SAWR-uh-pahd). Sauropods were tall, plant-eating dinosaurs. The fossils were much smaller than other sauropod fossils.
The fossils were from a dinosaur that lived on an island in Germany. The dinosaur had little food to eat and little space to roam. It never grew!
Germany is a country in Europe. Why might scientists have named the dinosaur Europasaurus?
The dinosaur shrank over time to fit on the island. Scientists named their new discovery
Scientists sometimes group dinosaurs by the food they eat.

93,83,"Deitte (DEE-et) Curry's dog was having trouble breathing. Doctors said the 12-year-old dog was sick. The dog had a weak heart and needed an operation. Doctors put a
in the dog's heart. A pacemaker is a small device that helps the heart beat evenly.

95,520,"Healthy foods are good for you! They help your body grow. They also give you energy to work and play.
How do you know which foods to eat? Follow the food pyramid. Use it to make good choices. Choose more foods from groups on the pyramid with wider stripes.
The grains group gives you energy. Make sure at least half the grains you eat are whole grains. Eat brown rice, oatmeal, and popcorn. Try whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.
Color your plate with all kinds of veggies. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Experts say to eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Munch on carrots, corn, and broccoli.
The meat and bean group is high in protein. That helps build strong muscles. Eat fish, chicken, lima beans, and nuts.
Fruits are natures treats. They are sweet and tasty. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth too. Eat a variety of colors. Try an apple or a banana. You can also mix pieces of different fruits to make a salad.
Have milk and foods made with milk. Those foods are high in calcium. Calcium builds strong bones. Foods made with milk can be high in fat. Try low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese.
Your body needs only a little oil to keep it healthy. Some foods that have oils are nuts, tuna fish, and salad dressing.
The child climbing the food pyramid is a reminder to exercise. Why might exercise be important?

104,354,"The United States is having money trouble. It now costs more than a penny to make a penny. A nickel costs nearly 8 cents to make.
Why are those coins so costly? Copper, nickel, and zinc are metals that are going up in price. Copper and zinc are used to make pennies. Nickel and copper are used in nickels.
Some lawmakers want the U.S Mint to use a cheaper metal: steel. It was used in pennies made in 1943, when there wasnt enough copper. You wont see new steel coins just yet. Other lawmakers first have to agree to the plan.
Some lawmakers want to bring back the steel penny.

105,486,"Kids can help keep track of monarchs. They can put tags on them. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found.
Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. We want to learn about monarchs so we can save them, says scientist Chip Taylor.

106,454,"The Arctic is feeling the heat. Its sea ice is melting. The ice has been shrinking for more than 30 years, says scientist Mark Serreze. Over the past five years, it has been melting faster and faster.
Serreze works at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which keeps track of how much snow and ice is on Earth. He predicts, We could be looking at an ice-free Arctic in 2030.
Why is the ice melting? Earth is getting warmer. Scientists say that is because of pollution in the air. As Earths temperature rises, sea ice at the Arctic melts. The animals there will have a hard time, says Serreze.

107,113,"Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii.
is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii.
Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller.
Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish.
Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A
is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined.
Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage.
A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral
Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.
More than 2/3 of the world's coral reefs have been damaged by pollution and too much fishing.
Coral can be tan, orange, yellow, purple, or green.
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It is about 1,250 miles long and is located off the northeast coast of Australia.

108,148,"Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe!
In 1999, about 3? million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates.
The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall.
Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.
Follow these safety tips when playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates:
Learn how to use the toy the correct way.
If a move seems dangerous, do not try it!
Do not play with the toy outside at night.

114,675,"Scientists are purring over the latest panther news. The cats are slowly making a comeback.
or very, endangered species. Fifteen years ago, only about 25 of the adult cats were left in the wild. Today, there are more than 100.
Scientists helped the panthers by starting a special breeding program. They moved eight cougars to Florida. Cougars and panthers are both types of mountain lions.
The panthers and cougars had healthy babies together. In fact, todays Florida panthers are bigger and stronger than their grandparents.
The baby boom doesnt mean the panthers are in the clear, though. A population of 100 is still not [workable] in the long term, says scientist David Onorato. [This] is a project thats going to have to be done again.

115,430,"Music and dancing are often part of Hispanic festivals.
The face of the United States is changing. Hispanic Americans, also known as Latinos, make up the fastest-growing group. The latest U.S.
update shows that 41 million people are Hispanic. A census is a count of people.
Hispanic Americans are people whose families are from Spanish-speaking countries. Most of those countries are in Central and South America.
Nearly 297 million people live in the United States today. One of every seven people in our country is Hispanic!
The news comes just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month. It takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. During this time, Americans honor Hispanic history and customs. Many families celebrate by taking part in festivals and parades.

116,277,"Scientists in England are buzzing about a recent discovery. They figured out how bees and other insects fly so well. The research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft.
Cameras and sensors could be attached to the aircraft. These machines may one day be used for monitoring traffic or even for spying.
The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and are
(can bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.
""Our work will make the goal of tiny aircraft, perhaps eventually the size of bees, a step closer,"" says lead scientist Ismet Gursul.

119,569,"Wiffle ball has become a favorite backyard game through the years. This year, the famous plastic ball turns 50!
The Wiffle ball was invented in 1953. A few years later, the yellow plastic bat became part of the game.
A Connecticut man got the idea for the Wiffle ball after watching his son play ball with a friend. ""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" said his son.
The Wiffle ball is hollow and has eight holes on one side. In the air, the ball dips and curves. That makes it hard for a batter to hit.
How did the ball get its name? When a kid swung at a ball and missed, kids used to say he or she had whiffed, said the inventor's grandson.

120,523,"The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students reading lessons.
, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. He responds in so many ways, teacher Judy Quigley told
Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they dont worry about making mistakes. When you read to people, sometimes they dont really listen, but he always listens, Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told
Students keep Starbucks attention by changing their reading styles during stories. I say it kind of louder so he can hear it, explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesnt work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!

125,509,"More and more kids are using their heads. A recent study found that 73 out of every 100 kids wore a helmet while riding a bike. The bad news is that most of the kids did not wear the helmet the right way.
A helmet protects your head and brain if you fall. To work, the helmet must fit and be worn correctly. The helmet should rest on your head and cover your forehead. Helmet straps should always be tight. If the helmet is too loose, it wont protect your head. In-line skaters and skateboard riders should listen up too! Helmets are not just for biking. Experts say that kids should wear helmets for other wheel sports as well. Be smart and put safety first!

126,196,"A new food program helps kids cook up healthy habits.
If you are what you eat, then students at MacGregor Elementary School are fresh fruits and vegetables!
Kids at the school in Houston chow down on everything from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They grow all the food themselves in a school garden. Then they
the fruits and veggies and turn them into healthy meals. To harvest is to collect.
The students got their green thumbsand their appetites for fresh foodfrom the Recipe for Success Foundation. That group teaches kids about the food they eat. We make good food fun, says Gracie Cavnar, the groups founder.
, or working, chefs help students to make a
of meals. A variety is many different types. Some recipes call for foods that the kids may not have had before, such as tofu. But the students promise to try everything that they cook.
Travoyie McCardell, 9, ended up loving the chicken masala pizza that he made with his classmates. It tastes like chicken and vegetables and spices and herbs all mixed into one big meal, the third grader told
The program doesnt just get kids eating healthy at school. It also can change the way their families eat. Students get to bring home recipes to try with their parents. We used to eat out 24-7, Travoyie says. Now we just eat out a few times a month.
What does it take for a tiny seed to turn into a leafy plant? Lets take a look to find out.
 Seeds need water and oxygen to grow. Most seeds grow best between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
 After a seed takes in water, a root pushes out from the seed. The root collects water and minerals from the soil.
 A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves.
 The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called
Why might some kids be more willing to eat foods that they grow themselves?

127,669,"In the future, a fly on the wall may really be a robot! Scientists in California are developing a tiny flying robot. The flying robot is so small that scientists have to pick it up with tweezers.
Scientists are modeling the robot after a fly. They say flies are amazing insects. Flies can land upside down on the ceiling. They can fly backward. Flies can even turn faster than fighter jets!
Scientists say the flying robot will have many uses. For example, a tiny camera could be placed on the robot. Soldiers could then use the robot to spy on enemy troops.

128,676,"Elena Kagan is a new Supreme Court judge.
All rise! Theres a new judge in town. On October 4, Elena Kagan will start her first day as a U.S. Supreme Court
A justice is a judge. The Supreme Court is the countrys highest court.
She is only the fourth female Supreme Court justice in history. This is the first time the Court will have three women justices at the same time.
Steve Petteway/Collection of the Supreme Court of the U.S.
Elena Kagan is sworn in as a justice in Washington, D.C.
Kagan grew up in New York City. She dreamed of being a judge. Her dream started to come true in May. Thats when U.S. President Barack Obama picked her to become a justice.
Before she could join the Court, she had to meet with U.S. senators. They asked her questions. Then they voted on whether she should become a justice. A
or most, of the senators agreed she should.
In her new role, Kagan will work with eight other Supreme Court justices. They
or explain, the U.S. Constitution. That document says how the nation should be run. The justices must decide whether laws follow the Constitutions rules.
Kagan is studying cases that the Court will hear next month. She is excited about her job. I will work my hardest and try my best ... to serve this country I love as well as I am able,she says.
The U.S. government isnt a tree, but it does have branches! Each branch does a different job.
The U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives make up this branch. Their job is to create laws.
The president and vice president are in this branch. The president carries out laws and leads the U.S. military.
The U.S. Supreme Court runs this branch. Its duty is to make sure laws follow the U.S. Constitution.
Supreme Court justices can serve as long as they want. Why might that be?

129,373,"Artist Cynthia Vose believes that hats tell a story. Women have worn different hats throughout history. In honor of Womens History Month, Vose organized an art exhibit about hats. The exhibit is taking place this month at a library in Billerica, Massachusetts.
""Beyond fashion, hats represent the changing roles of women in society.""
In the 1800s, many American women wore bonnets. As women gained rights, they no longer wore hats just for fashion. Women began to wear hats for jobs that were once held by men.

130,137,"This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame.
That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best.
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy.
A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.)
So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.)
is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking.
Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans.
So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out!
Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824!
In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president.
Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt.
By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen.
The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A
is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll.
A poll's questions must be thought out. The questions need to be
That means the questions don't lead people to answer one way or another.
Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the
or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand.
It's As Easy As One, Two, Three
So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it.
The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper:
As a resident of Polling Place, which new town motto do you prefer?
Polling Place: A Place That's Right on the Numbers.
Polling Place: A Cool Place for Birds!
The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people.
We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below).
So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?

134,591,"Look, Mano hands! A van recently traveled from Europe to Asia without a driver. It used
to get around. Sensors are instruments that can notice heat, light, and sound. The vehicle also used electricity instead of gas.
The driverless van takes a passenger for a spin.
The van journeyed 8,077 miles. It made the trip in three months. Two scientists stayed in the van in case anything went wrong. One time, they had to take control when the vehicle was stopped by a police officer. The officer almost gave the experts a ticket because there was no driver! Once they explained that the drive was an experiment, he let them go.
We are happy we made it to the finishing line without any real problems, says Alberto Broggi. He works for the company that created the van. The company hopes that one day, robotic cars will make driving safer. Now if only they could make a robot to clean your room!

137,139,"If we don't change the way we treat the ocean, fish may be rare in the future.
Fish may be a rare sight by 2048. That is what a team of scientists predicted after making a four-year study. They say ocean life is being wiped out by pollution and too much fishing.
The loss of ocean life will mean less food. It will also affect the balance of the oceans ecosystem, say the scientists. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals and the environment working as a unit to live.

Thousands of kids put their art skills to the test. They entered the Pier 1/UNICEF/ Weekly Reader greeting card contest. The winners were Adam Carr, 6, from Florida and Anna Hall, 12, from Colorado.
Adams and Annas drawings were made into greeting cards. Money earned from the sale of the cards will be used to help needy kids.
What would Adam and Anna wish for kids around the world? ""I would wish them peace on Earth,"" Adam told Weekly Reader. ""Look at the similarities in people, not the differences,"" says Anna.

141,392,"Scientists are developing a sticky tape based on the hairs on a gecko's foot.
Move over, Spider-Man! Now you don't have to be a comic-book superhero to creep up walls. Scientists have recently invented a powerful tape. Someday, people may be able to use it to climb walls.
To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings.
What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall.
Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist.
It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!

147,552,"Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide!
Scientists arent quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea.
The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets.
The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

, or a show, about Tuts life.
Tuts full name is Tutankhamen (too-tan-KAH-muhn). He ruled Egypt about 3,000 years ago. That is a country in Africa.
Tut died when he was about 19 years old. His chariot was found thousands of years later. It is the wheel deal! Experts think the young ruler used the cart to hunt animals.
The chariot will be on display in the United States until January. [This] is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the people of New York to see something ... great ... from the boy kings life, says Egyptian expert Zahi Hawass.

149,252,"Scientists find a pyramid buried in sand in Egypt.
Scientists digging in Egypt recently found a big surprisea pyramid! They uncovered the
, or very old, structure under 65 feet of sand. Egypt is a country in Africa.
There was so much sand dumped here that no one had any idea there was something buried underneath, says Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian
. That is a person who studies people and cultures of the past.
, or guesses, that the monument is 4,300 years old. It might be the burial place for an Egyptian queen named Sesheshet.
Sesheshets pyramid was bigger when it was built, experts say. It probably stood 45 feet tall, and each side was 72 feet long. Wind and sand have worn away the top of the pyramid. The remains are only 16 feet tall.
A worker cleans an ancient scene painted on one of the pyramids blocks.
Hawass and his team are busy digging to find more of the pyramid. They hope to get inside the structure to the
That is a room where a persons body was put after he or she died. Markings inside the room might say for sure who was buried there.
Scientists dont expect to find much else inside the burial chamber. That is because robbers most likely found the pyramid long ago. They probably took any gold or other treasures that were inside.
Still, finding the pyramid is important, scientists say. To find a new pyramid is always exciting, Hawass explains. And this one is magical. It belonged to a queen.
People have lived in Egypt for about 5,000 years. Early Egyptians invented forms of math and writing. They had the first national government.
The Sahara is the worlds largest desert. It covers most of the country. The Nile River runs through Egypt. It is the longest river in the world.
The Great Pyramid is the worlds largest pyramid. The Great Sphinx is located nearby. It has the body of a lion and the head of a human.

150,65,"Imagine staring into the face of a 3,300-year-old king. That is what scientists in Egypt recently did. Egypt is a country in Africa. Scientists displayed the
of King Tutankhamen (too-tahn-KAH-mun) for the first time in history. A mummy is a body that has been prepared to last for a long time.
King Tut became the ruler of Egypt when he was 9 years old. He ruled for 10 years. Tut died at age 19. His
, or burial place, was discovered in 1922.
Tut was buried wearing a gold mask. Scientists removed it to show the king's blackened face. The team also moved the mummy into a special glass case to protect it. ""The face of the golden boy is amazing,"" spokesperson Zahi Hawass said inside the tomb. ""It has magic, and it has mystery.""

151,784,"? It may sound like a tongue twister, but it is actually a new species of dinosaur. Scientists recently finished a
were discovered in 1998 in South America. Fossils are ancient remains of plants or animals. Scientists spent almost six years cleaning the bones and putting them together. After studying the fossils, scientists learned that the dinosaur lived about 225 million years ago. It was one of the first two-legged plant-eating dinosaurs on Earth!
Scientists say the new species is related to dinosaurs that lived in what is now Europe. The discovery supports the idea of a supercontinent called

152,427,"The days of stinky feet are over. Gang Sun, a scientist, has invented a smell-free sock.
The sock's fibers are made with bits of
Chlorine is a chemical used to kill
Bacteria are tiny germs that you can see only with a microscope. Bacteria cause socks to smell. In the new socks, the chlorine kills any odor-causing bacteria.
A cross-country running team tested the socks. ""After running 9 miles, not having socks smell of feet is a real bonus,"" said one runner.
Sun hopes hospitals can use his odor-free fibers. The special fibers can kill bacteria in sheets, towels, and medical gowns.

, or guessed, that seven to 10 hurricanes will form in the Atlantic Ocean this season. That is above
This map shows the number of hurricanes in the five states that had the most of those storms from 1851 to 2006.

, or normal. The hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30.
, or busy, hurricane season? Warm water and wind, says Gerry Bell. He is one of the governments top hurricane
. A forecaster uses information to predict what will happen.
This year, the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than it usually is. That helps whip up more storms. Warm water provides a lot of moisture for hurricanes, Bell told
The current wind conditions are also perfect for storms, he says. Stronger hurricanes form when the speed and direction of wind is the same along much of the East Coast of the United States.
The worst of the storms may be over soon. Usually by mid-October, [they] dont really affect the United States anymore, Bell says.
This satellite image shows Hurricane Gustav spinning toward Louisiana.

, or at risk of dying out completely. Scientists recently filmed video of the animals for the first time. ""The big ears make them look cute and comical,"" scientist Jonathan Baillie told
Baillie is with the Zoological Society of London's EDGE of Existence program. The program works to

""It is important to conserve the long-eared jerboa,"" Baillie says. ""If we lost [the animals] there would be nothing similar on the planet.""

157,343,"Heavy backpacks can put stress on your spine.
Does your backpack ever feel as if it's filled with bricks? If so, you are not alone. Many kids tend to overload their backpacks.
A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad
(POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk.
Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert.
What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!

158,689,"Some projects take longer than others. The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota is one of them. Workers started carving the giant rock sculpture in 1948. They are still working on it today.
The memorial honors Chief Crazy Horse. Native American leaders chose to honor him because he was one of their heroes. Chief Crazy Horse was a Native American who fought for his people's right to their land and traditions.
When will the sculpture be finished? No one knows for sure. All that matters is that it's going forward, said the project manager.

Some creatures owners may be partly to blame for their pets increase in size, say researchers. People may feed their animals more unhealthy foods today than they did in the past.
Other animals extra pounds, however, are harder to explain. Animals some scientists study, such as mice and rats, have also grown bigger. [Those creatures] have been getting almost the exact same type of food over the past few [years], scientist David Allison told

160,45,"Scientists used the satellite to count different types of animals at the Bronx Zoo.
As the tallest animals in the world, giraffes have a great view of the zoo. Scientists recently had an even better view--from 280 miles above Earth! Animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were tracked from outer space with a
. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon.
of zoo animals and sent the images back to Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals that are alike in certain ways. Scientists studied the images to see how well the satellite could spot different species.
The Bronx Zoo is located in New York City.
So far, scientists are pleased with the results. They hope to use the satellite to track
animals in faraway places in the wild. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming
, or dying out completely. Currently, people track animals either by foot or by airplane. Scientists think that using a satellite to track animals will be both easier and cheaper.
""Taking a count is the first step in finding out if a species is in danger of extinction,"" scientist Scott Bergen told
Along with counting endangered animals, scientists want to learn where they
. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another.
Why do scientists want to learn where animals migrate? ""[We want to know where to] create national parks and other protected areas for endangered animals,"" said Bergen.
Would you want to be a scientist who studies endangered animals? Explain your answer.

162,707,"After years of protection, bald eagles and other endangered animals are making a comeback.
The future looks bright for some endangered animals! Thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists, many of these animals are doing well.
The bald eagle is one success story. The bird became the symbol of the United States in 1782. At that time, about 100,000 bald eagles lived in the lower 48 states. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs remained.
Hunting and loss of habitat contributed to the
or drop in number. However, the biggest threat came from DDT, a chemical used for farming. DDT made the birds eggshells so thin that chicks couldnt survive.
or not allowed. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was created. That law protects threatened plants and animals. Bald eagles soon gained protection under this law.
Today, there are more than 7,100 bald eagle nesting pairs in the lower 48 states. Plans are under way to take the birds off the endangered species list. If that happens, they will still be protected by other U.S. laws.
""It is a good endangered species success story,"" spokesperson Nicholas Throckmorton of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told
""Caring citizens have brought our national symbol back from the brink of extinction.""
The bald eagle isnt the only endangered species doing well. Here are some other success stories.
in and around Yellowstone National Park were endangered as a result of hunting and habitat loss. By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears lived in Yellowstone. Today, there are more than 600.
Scientists counted only 67 nesting females in 1973. Now the number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400.
of California were once killed by pollution and fishermen. In 1938, there were only 700 otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500.
Why was the bald eagle chosen as a national symbol?

163,563,"In 1990, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the Hubble Space Telescope into space. It has taken thousands of photos of planets, stars, and other space objects.
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus!
Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries.

The four-room hotel will be designed to
or fit, up to seven guests at a time. Rooms will have large windows so people can look down at Earth. The hotel will most likely open for business by 2016, according to Alexander Derechin. He works for the company that will build the space hotel.
Several other businesses are also working to put more people in space. A British airline company is building a shuttle to take visitors into space. It expects the aircraft to be completed by 2012.
That and other shuttles will keep the space hotel busy, says Derechin. Spaceships [for the public] are being built around the world, he says. They will need to fly somewhere.

170,379,"Park rangers bring Mesa Verdes history to light.
Mesa Verde has been a national park for more than 100 years.
Put on your party hat. This year, Mesa Verde (MAY-suh VEHR-day) National Park in Colorado has reason to celebrate. A century ago this past summer, the U.S. government set aside the land as a national park. (A century is 100 years.) The park protects the site of an ancient Native American city.
All year, the park has celebrated with special events. They included tours of the cliff homes and Native American dances, music, and stories.
(fuh-NA-lee), or big ending, of the celebration. On that night, park rangers will light up two of the largest cliff homes with about 100 lanterns.
The celebration honors the Native American tribe that built Mesa Verde. The tribe is called the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh). They are the
of todays Pueblo people. An ancestor is a family member who lived a long time ago.
The Ancient Pueblo lived in the area from about 600 to 1300. They lived on the
top until the 1100s. A mesa is a large, high rock with a flat top and steep sides. Later, they moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there.
""Its not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told
""It provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public.""
The park protects more than 600 ancient cliff homes. The two largest homes contain about 160 rooms each.
By 1100, the cliff homes were as large as some modern-day apartment buildings.
In what other ways can people celebrate Native American culture?

172,359,"Look out, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys! Here comes the next hot musical act: the animals!
Scientists recently announced that the music made by several kinds of birds and humpback whales shares some of the notes, rhythms, and harmonies found in music created by people. Scientists say that these animals may also pass songs along to one another, which means animals may be able to learn music.
Roger Payne, one of the scientists studying animal music, says his study ""proves that musical sounds can be enjoyed by all living things.""
Because animals cannot sing in a human language, however, Britney Spears and other pop stars have nothing to worry about!
What are animals communicating to one another when they sing?

173,454,"Ten-year-old Hunter York found a most unusual creature in his father's backyard. It was a snake with two heads! It ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" said Hunter.
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8-inch
. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Not all reptiles crawl on their bellies the way snakes do. Turtles and lizards are reptiles that creep on short legs.
Hunter's dad gave the two-headed reptile to a snake expert because they could not get it to eat. ""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad.

174,270,"The world's tallest living man recently saved the lives of two sick dolphins. The dolphins swallowed plastic from their pool at an aquarium in China.
Veterinarians, or animal doctors, couldn't figure out how to remove the plastic. Surgery would have hurt the dolphins too much. The doctors had the idea to ask for help from Bao Xishun from Mongolia. Bao is 7 feet 9 inches tall. His arms are about 3? feet long!
Bao used his long arms to reach into the animals' mouths and remove the plastic from their stomachs. ""The two dolphins are in very good condition now,"" aquarium manager Chen Lujun told reporters.

175,640,"Lily Thorpe from Colorado is one busy 11-year-old! She recently started a group called Kids Campaign. Lily meets with
and speaks with them about kids' causes. (Elected officials are people who are voted into office.)
Why did Lily start Kids Campaign? She noticed that many of her school library books were very old. To help schools in Colorado get money for books and other supplies they need, she decided to take action.
In the name of children everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard. ""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told

176,236,"A penny now costs more to make than the coin is worth.
Pennies are not small change to Sylvester Neal. The Washington man is on his way to collecting a million of them. ""Sometimes I walk with my head down looking for pennies"" Neal, 62, told
Will the penny collector have that chance much longer? The U.S. Mint reports that it costs more to
or make, a penny than a penny is worth. Is the penny worth it? Both sides of the debate put in their two cents.
Lawmaker Jim Kolbe from Arizona recently presented a plan to get rid of the penny. He told
that his plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel."" Here is why Kolbe and others say we should lose the penny:
Pennies cost more to make than theyre worth.
Pennies are hard to spend. Many places, such as vending machines and tollbooths, dont accept them.
Cashiers get annoyed when people pay with pennies.
Mark Weller leads the group Americans for Common Cents. Its members are working to save the penny. ""Americans want to keep the penny,"" he told
Heres why Weller and others support keeping the coin:
The penny is part of American history.
Rounding up sales will cost people more money.
Alyssa Mayorga is known as the ""Penny Princess."" The 11-year-old from California saves pennies to buy bulletproof vests for police dogs.
She recently raised money to buy vests for seven police dogs in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Each vest cost $400. ""I feel like Im helping the dogs when theyre on duty so they wont get hurt,"" Alyssa told
The penny was first minted in 1787. Benjamin Franklin suggested its original design.
President Abraham Lincoln first appeared on the penny in 1909. That year marked his 100th birthday.
A copper penny has very little copper in it. The penny is mostly zinc.
Should the penny stay or go? Discuss in class.

177,130,"Chew on this! Your school cafeteria may be getting a makeover. Members of the U.S. government are trying to pass a new law. It would make school foods healthier. Under the plan, school cafeterias would serve meals with ingredients that are better for you. Vending machines, such as the one below, would also sell healthy snacks.
The idea is part of First Lady Michelle Obamas plan. She hopes to end childhood
That is the condition of being very overweight. About one-third of kids in the United States are too heavy, according to a study. Kids who are overweight are at a higher risk of having health problems.

181,11,"A purple octopus is making a splash! It is one of 11
or types, of sea creatures scientists recently found near Canada. That is a country north of the United States. Experts say the animals may be new to science.
Researchers discovered the creatures in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to the purple octopus, scientists found a sea star and many types of coral and sea sponges.
We found all kinds of beautiful creatures, Ellen Kenchington told
She is one of the scientists who helped find the animals.
Researchers didnt explore the ocean alone, however. An underwater robot gave them a hand. The robot can search areas of the sea that are too deep for people to visit, explains Kenchington.

182,619,"On April 22, millions of people around the world will celebrate Earth Day. People are finding many ways-from inventions to projects-to help protect the environment. Look inside to find out how they are working to make a difference.
Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round.
Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment?
One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage.
Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions.
? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity.
Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships.
Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.

Polar bears are on thin ice. Their home in Alaska is in trouble. The animals could become
. That means to be at risk of dying out completely.
To help the big bears, some U.S. officials want to set aside more than 200,000 square miles in Alaska. The area would be a protected habitat. It would have special rules to help keep polar bears safe.
About 3,500 polar bears live in northern Alaska. That area is part of the Arctic. The Arctic is the northernmost place in the world. About 25,000 polar bears live there.
Some people are worried that the number could fall, though. Alaskas polar bears face dangers in their home. Some companies drill for oil off the states coast (right). People use oil to heat their homes. However, an oil spill could hurt the animals, some experts warn.
By creating a protected habitat for polar bears, the U.S. government could
drilling there. To limit is to control. Some Alaskans dont want the habitat, though. They say the bears dont need protection. Plus, drilling is important for the state, says Alaskas governor, Sean Parnell.
Melting sea ice is another problem for the polar bears. The animals stand on the ice while hunting for food. Some scientists say the ice is melting because of
. That is the slow rise of Earths temperature.
Its important to protect polar bears habitat, wildlife expert Kassie Siegel told
656,424 square miles (Alaska is the largest state. It is more than twice the size of Texas.)
, or usual, January temperature is 11 degrees Fahrenheit. The average July temperature is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.

185,80,"Scientists go to great lengths to copy the world's tallest trees.
Tree climbers at Roy's Redwoods Open Space Preserve in California have a huge job! They are climbing redwoods more than 200 feet tall to snip cuttings from the trees' highest branches. Some
, or tree experts, say those cuttings may help
Redwoods are some of the tallest trees in the world. They can grow more than 300 feet tall and live for more than 2,000 years. However, many redwood forests have been cut down. Only 5 percent of forests with the oldest redwood trees are left.
David Milarch of Champion Tree Project International wants to change that. He has launched a campaign to
redwoods so new forests can be planted. To clone is to copy
. Genetic material is information inside living creatures. It determines features, such as size and height.
Milarch and his team want to clone the oldest, tallest redwoods. So far, the team has collected 900 cuttings from three redwoods in California. Arborists put them in a special nursery to grow. After a few years, the cuttings will be ready for planting.
Some of those young trees will stay in California, but Milarch also wants to send the cloned trees all over the world. ""[The forests] can be a model for the world,"" he told
. ""We've made terrible mistakes by cutting down forests ... and we're going to go back and try to fix it.""
Trees don't have diaries, but they do keep good records. Each ring in a tree's trunk represents a year of growth. The more rain that fell during the year, the wider the ring is.

186,455,"U.S. President Barack Obama wants to bring our country up to speed.
That is technology that allows computers to link to the Internet without using wires. About two-thirds of U.S. homes have wireless Internet. The president hopes to bring the technology to the rest of Americans.
Having wireless Internet could change how schools and businesses run, Obama says. The technology could help kids finish their schoolwork from home, he recently explained. Also, firefighters could quickly download information on their way to burning buildings.
The plan will go to Congress for approval. If it passes, Obama will work to bring wireless Internet to towns that dont have it. He will also build a special wireless network for police and other emergency workers.
This isnt just about faster Internet, Obama says. Its about connecting every corner of America.

187,774,"When Dan Shaw and Cuddles go out, they attract quite a crowd. At first glance, Cuddles may look like a guide dog. But she is actually a miniature guide horse!
Cuddles and Shaw, who is blind, have been together since 2001. As a guide horse, Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he needs to go. Cuddles wears tiny sneakers that prevent her from slipping.

is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon, in Arizona, was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. Looking down from the skywalk, people can see the canyon floor 4,000 feet below.
The Hualapai (WAH-luh-pie) Indians, who live near the Grand Canyon National Park, allowed the structure to be built. Some tribe members hope the skywalk encourages tourists to visit the natural wonder. The glass walkway can hold the weight of a few hundred people, says architect Mark Johnson. Hualapai leaders and two former astronauts were the first people to set foot on the new skywalk.

194,141,"Scientists in Canada are playing Go Fish. They recently counted sharks that swim in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada.
Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean.
Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to
or watch, the sharks in the coming months.
Scientist Steve Campana took part in the shark count. He says not all sharks are safe like those near Canada. ""Worldwide, sharks are in trouble,"" he told

or circles, Earth. Hubble takes pictures of space for scientists to study. The movie,
follows astronauts on a mission to repair Hubble.
student reporter Peter Brosnan interviewed Massimino about the mission.
How would you describe Hubble to kids?
Id say its as big as a school bus.
How did you feel saying good-bye to the Hubble Space Telescope?
We were happy that we didnt break it! ... We had done our job correctly, and it was on its way.
I think the best thing is the view of the Earth. ... Its as close as you can [get] to actually seeing it [from space]. Youll see how beautiful the Earth is.

202,328,"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns.
A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called
Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii.
Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano.
is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface.
The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of
flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path.
Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes.
For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions.
Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain.
Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes?

204,10,"Railroad tracks connecting Seoul and Pyongyang should be completed in September 2001. Seoul is South Korea's capital. Pyongyang is North Korea's capital.
North Korea and South Korea are two countries in Asia. They have been officially at war for 47 years. Now, however, the countries seem to be making tracks toward peace.
South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years.
The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.

206,553,"The King memorial takes shape on the National Mall.
A piece of the nation's capital will honor an important leaderDr. Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial for King is being built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It will be the first memorial on the Mall to honor an African American.
A ceremony was held on November 13 to mark the start of construction. President George W. Bush and other leaders were among the thousands of people who gathered for the event.
""When the work is done, the King memorial will be a fitting tributepowerful and hopeful and poeticlike the man it honors,"" Bush said at the ceremony.
If all goes as planned, the memorial will be finished in 2008. It will have trees, flowing water, and a 30-foot statue of King. Quotes from King's speeches will be carved into a stone wall.
King (19291968) grew up in the U.S. South. At that time, the South was
or separated by race. Under the law, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people. They were forced to sit in the backseats of buses. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains.
King worked to change the laws by giving speeches and leading peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders,
were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated equally.
On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. A crowd of more than 200,000 people came to hear him. In his speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""
In your own words, describe what King meant in his speech.

208,695,"Get ready to sing Happy Birthday! On July 9, a new nation will be born.
That country may be called the Republic of South Sudan. It is in Africa. Earlier this year, southern Sudans people voted to become an
or free, country. They recently announced the results of the election.
The future nation is currently part of Sudan. That is the largest country in Africa. More than 2 million people in southern Sudan voted to
from northern Sudan. To separate is to pull apart.
The north and the south had been at war on and off for more than 50 years. Most people in the north follow a religion called Islam (iss-LAHM). People in the south practice Christianity and other religions. Some of the fighting happened because Sudans government tried to make people in the south follow Islams rules.
Soon, southern Sudans people will govern themselves. It wont be easy, world leaders say. The area is very poor. More than half of southern Sudans population lives on less than $1 a day. Many people do not have access to clean water.
A man works on an oil rig in southern Sudan.
The young nation will be rich in one thing, thoughoil. Southern Sudan produces about 375,000 barrels of oil a day. The south used to share its oil money with the north. Now it will keep the money and pay the north to help move the oil.
Southern Sudans leaders are hopeful about the future. We are a ... nation that has just been born, says official Pagan Amum. And like a human baby, we are
[or weak] but have the [chance] to become great.
247,105 square miles (slightly smaller than Texas)
7.5 million to 9.7 million people (about the same size as New Jersey)
What challenges might southern Sudan face? Why?

209,513,"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is located in northern Alaska. The ANWR is home to polar bears, wolves, caribou, and other animals.
In 1960, the land was made a protected area for animals and plants. But now, President George W. Bush wants to allow companies to begin drilling for oil in the ANWR.
Supporters say that the oil drilling would provide jobs for Alaskans. They also argue that the oil in the ANWR will help lower oil and gasoline prices. They say that taking oil from U.S. land is cheaper than using foreign oil.
Today, most of the oil that is used in the United States is
Opponents say the drilling would pollute the area's land, air, and water. Pollution would harm the plants that the area's animals eat to survive.
Studies by the U.S. government show there may be only a six-month supply of oil in the ANWR. Opponents believe the risk of polluting the ANWR is not worth such a small supply of oil.

211,407,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of a famous decision that changed American history. It all started with a court case called
In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away.
Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
On May 17, 1954, the Court ruled that it was unfair to have separate schools for black and white students.

212,83,"Taking those first baby steps is very excitingespecially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived!
This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did.
Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a
, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step.
The walking robots are more than just toys. In the future, robots like these may be used to perform dangerous space missions. The discoveries could also help scientists develop better robotic limbs for people who have lost their arms or legs.

213,642,"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of GaHoole
dont look like cartoonsthey look like real owls! That was the goal of Grant Freckelton and Simon Whiteley. They are
who worked on the new movie. An animator creates art for movies.
student reporter Jackson Brantley talked with the animators.
Jackson Brantley: What is your favorite part of the movie?
We like [the] cool owls that have helmets and battle gear.
JB: How did you create the characters?
[We found photographs of] real owls. We [changed each owl] enough so that it [showed] what the character is like. We tried to make [the main character] sort of wide-eyed.
JB: What do you love most about your job?

217,728,"The Hispanic American population tops 50 million.
eres looking at you! The countrys population is becoming bigger and more
or different, than ever before. There are now more than 308 million people
or living, in the United States. Many of them come from different countries and backgrounds.
More than 50 million of those people are
Those are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Only about 35 million Hispanic Americans lived in the United States 10 years ago.
The new numbers are from the nations
That is an official count of a countrys population. The U.S. census takes place every 10 years. U.S. officials recently announced the 2010 census results.
The Asian American population grew the fastest of all races, the count showed. That group increased by 43 percent from 2000 to 2010. There are now about 14.7 million Asian Americans in the nation.
Kids are a big reason the country is getting more diverse, officials say. Nearly half of all children [are] something other than non-Hispanic white, Stacy Vidal told
She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Census Bureau.
The census didnt just track who lives in the United States. It also showed
people live. California, New York, and Texas still have the biggest populations. About one-fourth of Americans live in those three states, the count found.
States in the South and West saw most of the population growth over the past 10 years. Nevadas population grew the fastest. It went up by 35 percent since 2000.
The census can teach us a lot about the United States, Vidal says. It paints a picture of who we are as a nation.
The United States has seen a big jump in the Hispanic American population over the past 40 years. This graph shows how that groups numbers have grown. What do you think its population will be in 2020? Why?
Why might U.S. officials want to know how many people live in the country?

218,265,"Do you ever wonder what it would be like to fly? Since 1992, the Young Eagles program has been giving kids free airplane rides in the sky.
The program has the goal of giving a million kids a ride before December 17, 2003. That is the 100-year anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight.
The Wright brothers made history one day in December 1903. On that day, their dream of flying came true. They flew the first engine-powered airplane. Today, the Young Eagles program lets kids experience that same thrill of flight.

219,289,"Some students in Pennsylvania recently made a hair-raising find. The kids at Landisville Intermediate Center discovered a
hair. Mastodons were furry, elephant-like animals. The creatures lived until about 10,000 years ago.
The students uncovered the hair while working on the Mastodon Matrix Project. That project allows volunteers to study material from sites where the remains of mastodons were found.
The class used paintbrushes to comb through the dirt. It felt like I was a scientist, Katie Minnich told
Students (above) found a hair that belonged to a mastodon.
Buried within the soil was the 8-inch-long hair. Each student studied the strand using a magnifying glass. They knew it did not come from a human, a dog, or a cat. It felt like a wire, explains Cameron Aksu.
The students were amazed at their brush with history. It was really cool, says Allee Glinsky. We knew [the hair was] a part of something really old.

220,635,"The Sequel of Tut and His Treasures
Hollywood is used to rolling out the red carpet for celebrities. Now it has laid out the carpet once again for its latest starKing Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAHmun). The famous Egyptian king's treasures are traveling the country in a new exhibit, now open in Los Angeles. The tour will make stops in three other U.S. cities before returning to Egypt in 2007. ""
King Tut and his treasures first visited the United States in the 1970s. That display attracted a whopping 8 million visitors. The new exhibit looks at what life was like for Tut and other
who ruled ancient Egypt more than 3,500 years ago. A pharaoh is an ancient Egyptian ruler.
After the death of his father, King Tut became pharaoh at just 9 years old. Tut reigned for about nine years before he died mysteriously. He was buried in a hidden tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, an area near the Nile River.
Tut's tomb remained locked away until 1922, when British
Howard Carter made one of history's greatest finds. An archaeologist is a person who digs up ancient ruins and studies the past. The long-lost tomb contained Tut's
, or preserved body. The mummy was buried inside three gold coffins within a
, or stone coffin. A mask of solid gold rested over the mummy's face.
Glistening riches filled King Tut's tomb. They included statues, jewelry, weapons, the king's golden throne and other furniture, and even childhood games. The ancient Egyptians believed in the
. They buried their dead with many items they believed could be used in life after death.
Although Tut's mask and mummy are too fragile to be removed from Egypt, some of Carter's other fascinating finds are on display in the latest exhibit. ""
"". One of the treasures, a wooden figure of the boy king, is the first object that visitors see when they enter the exhibit. In the darkened room, a light shines on the wooden figure. The figure is depicted without Tut's famous gold or jewels.
""Not only does [the figure] show Tut's majesty, but it also shows his human side,"" Egyptian expert David Silverman told
""You can see a young boy behind those eyes.""
The exhibit also includes the boy king's crown and gold dagger. The dagger was found strapped to the mummy's thigh. Scientists believe that Tut's subjects buried their king with the dagger to fight villains on his journey to the afterlife. Objects that belonged to Tut's family members and other Egyptian royalty are also featured at the exhibit.
, or follow-up, exhibit different from the one that visited the United States in the 1970s? ""The first exhibit was about the discovery of the tomb,"" Silverman told
""This exhibition is about the life of the young kinghis family, his history, his responsibilities.""
The wealth of objects discovered in the young king's tomb leads scientists to wonder what might have been contained in the tombs of other pharaohs. Those tombs, unlike Tut's, were
, or robbed, long ago. As Silverman says, ""Egypt continues to fascinate.""
King Tut's showstopping exhibit includes more than 130
. An artifact is a human-made object. Only 13 of those artifacts were included in the last Tut tour in the 1970s. Most have never before left Egypt.
as a crown. The crown depicts a vulture and a cobra, for protection in the afterlife.

in the shape of an ankh, an Egyptian symbol of life, was buried with Tut.
held Tut's liver, which Egyptians believed would be needed in the afterlife. Canopic jars are special containers used to hold the preserved organs of the dead. A peek inside shows rows of ancient Egyptian writing.
Why might King Tut's tomb have been the only royal burial chamber not damaged by thieves?

221,18,"What is one of your worst nightmares about the school day? No recess!
For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess.
Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or
, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests.
The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess.
Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day.
Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores.
One fifth grader in Virginia told the
she looks forward to the daily break so she can return fresh to her schoolwork. ""I feel like I'm ready for anything that comes my way,"" she said.

222,9,"For years, scientists have known about a group of icy objects, called
, in our solar system. They circle the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Scientists thought centaurs were made of ice and were almost completely smooth. But recent photos of one of those objects, named Asbolus 8405, are proving scientists wrong.
Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice.
Asbolus 8405 formed when the solar system first formed, scientists say. They hope that the object will help them learn more about what the solar system was like when it first formed.

223,108,"Map of Washington, D.C.: The World War II memorial is located between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.
Francis Campane and his wife took a train trip from Connecticut to Washington, D.C., in the spring. They were headed to the nation's capital to visit the newly opened National World War II Memorial.
is a special monument that honors a person, a group of people, or an event. The World War II memorial opened in April. It was built to honor the 16 million men and women who had served in the armed forces during World War II (1939-1945).
The trip was especially meaningful to Campane, 80, because he is a World War II
. Veterans are people who have served in the armed forces. Campane served in the U.S. Navy during the war. He was stationed aboard a ship called the U.S.S.
""I was amazed at the memorial and the gratitude the American people have shown World War II veterans,"" Campane told
. ""It's great to know our generation will be remembered.""
A plaza, a reflecting pool, fountains, and stone arches are among the memorial's main features. A wall of gold stars at the memorial honors the more than 400,000 Americans killed in the war.
An artist's drawing of the World War II memorial.
The World War II memorial is one of many places across the country where people will remember the U.S. military on November 11. That is Veterans Day--a holiday set aside to honor our nation's armed forces.
People will pay tribute to the 140,000 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq and to the more than 1,000 members of the U.S. military who have died there. For his part, Campane plans to volunteer at a hospital that cares for veterans.

225,655,"February 27 was a sad day in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the children's television program
, lost a brief battle with stomach cancer. He died at age 74 at his home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
""He was so genuinely, genuinely kind, a wonderful person,"" said David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on the show.
Fred Rogers touched generations of children. His show became public television's longest-running program. It was produced for more than 30 years-from 1968 to 2001-and continues to air in reruns.
On each show, Mr. Rogers welcomes viewers by taking off his jacket and shoes and putting on a cardigan sweater and sneakers. One of his cardigans hangs in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C.
A Presbyterian minister, Mr. Rogers taught kids the importance of self-worth with his trademark line, ""I like you just the way you are.""
Mr. Rogers didn't consider himself a TV star. ""I always thought I was a neighbor who just came in for a visit.""

227,317,"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school?
A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble.
The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000.
About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol.
The study found that kids who spend their free time hanging out with nothing to do, who get poor grades, or who don't talk with their parents are eight times more likely to take part in unhealthful activities later on, such as smoking cigarettes or trying drugs.
Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said.
""How young people do at school and what they do with their free time are the most important [ways of predicting] risky behavior,"" said Blum.
Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework.
The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a
kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time:
There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois.
Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together.
The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township.

228,795,"Experts scramble to keep this world-famous city from sinking.
Venice attracts millions of tourists each year for its beautiful art and architecture. People weave their way through the city on boats because there are no streets. A maze of long
or waterways, takes the place of roads. In fact, there are no cars or trucks in Venice.
Venice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a
or an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city to save it from sinking. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to keep the city afloat. And it means adding more water!
Venice is sinking at a rate of 1.57 inches per year, according to scientists. The Italian government has proposed the building of floodgates to control the flow of the sea.
Scientists hope to turn the tide in favor of Venice. They want to pump huge amounts of water into the ground through sturdy pipes. Scientists expect the water will expand the sand underneath and prop up the city. They hope to test the project on a small area over the next few months.
In Venice, a maze of long canals takes the place of roads.
Scientists behind the plan say that the pipes will work along with the floodgates to help save the city. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnt carried out in a careful way.
Everyone, however, agrees that saving the sinking city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose tremendous part of [history],"" Melissa Conn of Save Venice, an organization dedicated to helping preserve the city, told reporters.

229,208,"""If I had one wish, it would be to bring peace to Earth and comfort to all the families who lost friends and loved ones [in the terrorist attacks],"" fourth grader Brandon wrote in an e-mail to
Brandon and millions of other kids have come together to help the victims of the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. Those kids have been offering comfort to one another; collecting clothes, food, water, and other supplies to send to rescue workers; and raising money to help the victims' families.
As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before.""
Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas.
Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done:
In Georgia, Parker Pratt, age 10, and Mac Conway, age 9, opened a lemonade stand and collected about $60 for charity.
Teachers and students at the Academy Hill School in Wilton, Maine, declared Friday, September 21, Red, White, and Blue Day. Everyone at the school wore the colors of the American flag to school that day.
In Stow, Ohio, 7-year-old Alexa came up with an idea that enabled her class to raise $113. ""I saw people who were crying because they didn't have houses or anything and they lost their sisters and brothers,"" she said.
In Oklahoma, kids and their parents collected more than 40,000 teddy bears to give kids in 350 schools in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future.
If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims.
* The American Red Cross can be contacted at 1-800-HELP-NOW.
* The Salvation Army can be contacted at 1-800-SAL-ARMY.
* The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at
You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help.

230,141,"Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is
In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems.
The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools.
Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need.
In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.

231,467,"How will a growing U.S. population affect the countrys future?
The United States is about to reach a huge milestone. The population will hit 300 million sometime in late October, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimate is based on a running total of births, deaths, and the number of people moving in and out of the country.
""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday. Its a number that gives us an opportunity to see where weve been and think about where we want to go,"" scientist Howard Hogan of the U.S. Census Bureau told
Its been almost 40 years since the U.S. population hit the 200 million mark. The country has added about 2.8 million people each year. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States.

Hispanic Heritage Month is September 15 to October 15.
Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States. Nearly 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the country, reports the U.S. Census Bureau. They are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries.
To honor Hispanic traditions and history, Americans celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It began on September 15. That date marks the anniversary of independence for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.
During Hispanic Heritage Month, many Americans will take part in festivals and parades. Students across the country will also spend the month learning how people of Hispanic heritage have added to our countrys history.

232,438,"A new sports car is making waves. With the touch of a button, this convertible turns into a boat. It recently went for a test-drive, jetting along the Thames River in London, the capital of England.
Named the Aquada, the car can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour on land and about 30 miles per hour on water. The wheels pull into the car as soon as it hits water.
To avoid leaks, the car has no doors. Like a boat, the car requires drivers and passengers to climb over the side to get into it.
The new cars aren't cheap. One hundred are being built and will sell for $235,000 each at the end of the year.

The company will collect the bricks and make a brick-for-brick matching donation to schools in New Orleans, Louisiana. The city continues to recover from Hurricane Katrina.
Some of the LEGO bricks will be used to construct a large model of a rebuilt New Orleans as imagined by kids across the country. The sculpture will be donated to the city as artwork. LEGO bricks will be collected through August 15, 2006. Each child who makes a donation will receive a LEGO-studded rubber bracelet.

Oregon has the pear. Georgia has the peach. West Virginia has the Golden Delicious apple. Now, thanks to a group of elementary school students, Florida has its own official state fruitthe orange. The students attend Southside Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida.

Shapiro's class, fourth graders at the time, got the idea more than a year ago after they read about a class in New Jersey that made the blueberry their state's official fruit. That prompted the group of Florida students to write letters to local lawmakers. They also collected signatures and even wrote a song about the fruit.
The students saw the ""fruits"" of their labor. In May, Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, signed the orange bill into law at their school. He sat in a room full of crates of oranges surrounded by a dozen students in bright orange shirts. ""We made history,"" Kia Gentile, 11, told

237,267,"During National SAFE KIDS Week, doctors plan to give kids tips about how to prevent accidents.
Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents.
The graph shows the number of kids ages 5 to 14 who were treated in emergency rooms in 1999 for injuries suffered while doing these four activities.
""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms.""
The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents.
In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger.
Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law.
Scooter accidents may be on the rise, but bicycles account for more injuries than scooters or any other product except cars, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign.
In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head.
The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding.

238,442,"The North Bridge at Minute Man National Park is where the ""shot heard 'round the world"" was fired and the Revolutionary War began.
Minute Man National Historical Park outside of Boston made history in 1775. It was the site where the Revolutionary War and America's battle for independence from British rule began.
Today, it is the site of a different kind of struggle. Heavy traffic and noisy jets from a nearby airport threaten the peace at this historic landmark.
This year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added the park to its list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States. An
place is a site in danger of being destroyed. To protect the park, officials will try to stop the airport's growth.
Neglect and the development of roads and buildings are dangers for many historic sites. The trust works to
, or save, threatened historic treasures. It also helps raise money to support endangered historic sites.
More than 145 sites have appeared on the trust's list since 1988. All have been saved except one. Bridges, schools, hospitals, and even an airport
made this year's list. A terminal is a transportation station.
The TWA Terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was designed by a famous architect and completed in 1962. Many people have traveled through it over the years. Now there are plans to knock it down to make way for a new building. Officials at the trust want to save the terminal.
""These places tell us who we are as a nation,"" said the president of the National Trust. He says that unless people become aware of the importance of these historic sites and take action to protect them, ""America's past won't have a future.""

The third graders at Prairie View Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, play special computer games for homework. Students spend at least 20 minutes four times a week playing the games. Each game is based on their schoolwork.
Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says the games help kids learn. Other educators agree.
""The kids love it,"" said Joy Davis, a principal at a school where the games are given as homework. ""If you can get students where they think they're learning and playing, it has hit the magic mark,"" she said.
Kids like to play the computer games. ""I like it because it's challenging, and when I mess up I do it over and over again,"" student Adel Ahmed said.
Lightspan, a company in San Diego, California, designs the games. More than 4,000 schools in 46 states use them. The games have helped a few schools increase scores on standardized tests. The new games might even improve grades, and kids say the games are fun.
According to fourth grader Osley Galvez, playing learning games is better than doing homework the old way. ""With this, you play with the controls. It's fun!""

The Wiffle ball's design, which has not changed since 1953, includes eight holes on one side. The idea was the brainchild of a Connecticut man who watched his 12-year-old son and a friend struggle to throw curve balls to each other.
""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" the creator's son told
Early versions of the Wiffle ball included square holes and diamond-shaped holes. Neither of them worked.
That's how the Wiffle ball was born. Several years later, the plastic bat joined the ball.
How did the ball get its name? When you swing that plastic yellow bat and strike out, you whiff, said the creator's son.

241,752,"The National Museum of the American Indian opened on September 21, 2004.
Drumbeats echoed. Songs and cheers filled the air. Spirits soared. More than 20,000 Native Americans in traditional feather headdresses and clothing gathered in Washington, D.C., in late September.
They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol.
""[The new museum] is a living tribute to the first Americans,"" museum director W. Richard West Jr. told the crowd. West is a member of the Southern Cheyenne tribe.
Native Americans from Alaska to South America
, or came together, for the museum's opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling.
The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America.
Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!""

Native American artifacts, such as these baskets, will be on display at the National Museum of the American Indian.
A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions.
There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time.
The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers.
The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's caf.
Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.
In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages.
Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians.""
To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told
. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here.""

2002 - the Old Man from collapsing.
One of New Hampshires most famous faces recently became history. In May, the Old Man of the Mountain crumbled to the ground.
The Old Man, of course, wasnt a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old mans face. A
is a side view of a face.
Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs.
The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse.
Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade.
Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?
However, other people dont necessarily feel the same way. ""Mother Nature put him there, and Mother Nature took him,"" said one committee member. ""To put it back up, to rebuild, wouldnt be the same.""

245,710,"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years.
Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones.
""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country.""
Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight.
Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles.
International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements.
Why us it important for governments around the world to protect children?
The U.N. wants to save children like Alhaji Babah Sawane from suffering. The report sends a strong message to governments everywhere: They will be held accountable for their actions.

246,3,"How many moons circle Earth? Everyone know that Earth has only one moon. But in September, some scientist said they might have discovered a second moon circling, or
Scientist discovered a tiny object in a strange orbit around Earth. A space object that orbits another object in space, as the moon does, is called a
. The newly discovered satellite completes its orbit once every 50 days.
Because of the satellite's strange orbit the scientist first thought that it was a small space rock. As scientist studied the newly discovered object, they learned that it did not come from space. They decided that the ""new moon"" was actually from Earth.
Scientist now say the tiny satellite is actually a part of an old Saturn V rocket. The Saturn V was the largest rocket ever built in the United Sates. It was larger than a football field. The Saturn V launched the Apollo astronauts who went to the moon.

247,427,"A NASA Spacecraft Lands on an Asteroid for the First Time.
On February 12, scientists on Earth fired rockets on the
spacecraft, turning it toward Eros. Eros is an
, or space rock that is orbiting the sun. As the spacecraft slowly descended, it bounced and scientists were afraid the craft would crash.
Shown is the location of the asteroid belt in our solar system, and the orbit of Eros.
: The planets and their orbits are not drawn to scale.
began its incredible space odyssey five years ago. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the spacecraft in 1996. For the next four years,
sped toward Eros, covering nearly 2 billion miles.
After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid.
completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded,
would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [
] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth.
NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once.
Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days.
Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the
. Eros, however, is a kind of asteroid that comes closer to Earth than most asteroids. Such asteroids are called
. Scientists believe that Eros may be similar to the near-Earth asteroid that slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, probably killing the dinosaurs.
About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say.
There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun.
Eros is about twice the length of Manhattan, New York.
Eros orbits the sun once every 21 months.
Eros has so little gravity that a baseball hit on its surface would fly into space.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh 2 ounces on Eros.
The daytime temperature on Eros is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

248,85,"Eileen Collins was the first female shuttle commander for NASA.
As a little girl, Eileen Collins dreamed of becoming an astronaut when she grew up. ""I wanted to fly the space shuttle,"" she said. ""When I was very young and first started reading about astronauts, there were no women astronauts.""
After many years of hard work in college, flight school, and the military, Collins's dream came true. She made history in 1995 as the first woman to pilot a space shuttle. In 1999, she made history again when she became the first female shuttle
for NASA, the U.S. space agency. A commander is someone who leads a crew.
Collins may enjoy the distinction of being the first female shuttle commander, but she hopes it's ""not for long!"" A
is an accomplishment that sets a person apart from others. Collins wants more women to follow in her footsteps. ""The young people are going to be the ones to take us on to more exciting adventures,"" she said.
NASA's space shuttles have been confined to Earth since February 1, 2003. On that tragic day, the space shuttle
exploded after a 16-day mission. All seven astronauts aboard were killed.
During liftoff, a piece had broken off
's fuel tank and smashed a hole in the wing's heat-resistant tiles. Those tiles protect the shuttle from the very high temperatures that the craft experiences when speeding back into Earth's atmosphere. The damage went undetected, and
After the accident, space travel seemed riskier than ever. Because of the dangers, some people wondered whether NASA's shuttles would return to space.
Now NASA officials say it's time. Collins will lead the historic return-to-flight mission. The mission is scheduled for May or June on the space shuttle
Although NASA's shuttles have been grounded, they haven't been collecting dust. In fact, Collins and her crew of six astronauts have been very involved in updates to the shuttles to prevent another disaster. (See ""
Collins and NASA officials are confident that the shuttle is safer than ever, and the crew is ready for the upcoming mission. ""It's time for us to go fly,"" said Collins. ""If [the shuttle] wasn't safe, I wouldn't get on it.""

through a slow somersault called a flip. This will be the first time this
, or move, will be done. The flip will help the crew check for any damage to the heat-resistant tiles.
The mission's success will be measured on how the safety improvements made to
work. Collins views a successful, safe mission as a chance to prove to the world that NASA has reduced the risk of space travel.
To Collins and the crew, there is more than success at stake. They believe the mission will honor the lost astronauts of
. ""It's their legacy we're continuing,"" said a crew member.
NASA has been working to make the shuttle safer. New inspection tools and cameras have been installed on
. Changes have been made in the fuel tank design to make sure that no parts fall off during the launch.
Once in space, the astronauts will control a robotic arm called a boom from inside the shuttle. A camera at the end of the boom will look for damage on the shuttle's underside and wings. If damage is detected, the astronauts can attempt to repair it or wait to be rescued at the International Space Station.
Given the dangers of space travel, should the shuttle program continue? Why or why not?

249,559,"I [want] to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code
Governor Bush says that roughly one-quarter of the government budget
(extra money), which comes from taxes, should be returned to the people. He says his plan would promote economic growth and help people lead better lives by cutting high tax rates. The plan would lower the tax rate for married couples and families with children. He says the 6 million poorest families would pay no taxes.
I am calling for the right kind of tax relief--tax cuts that [will] help those who need them the most
Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes, but not by the amount Bush wants to. He says some of the surplus money is needed to support Social Security, a program that helps older people. Gore also wants to pay the debt the United States owes. He wants to cut taxes for married couples and make it easier for people of all ages to set aside money for education.

250,325,"A reward is being offered for toy ducks washing ashore.
Some people may find more than shells along the northeast coast of the United States. Rubber ducks could wash ashore any time soon.
About ten years ago, 29,000 yellow rubber ducks that were headed for bathtubs around the country became lost at sea. Boxes of the toys fell off a ship during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. Plastic beavers, turtles, and frogs were included in the shipment too.
has been tracking the toys' journey. An oceanographer is a scientist who studies the ocean.
The plastic toys floated along Alaska's coast and through the Bering Strait. Bobbing past polar bears and seals, the toys were caught in ice around the North Pole for several years.
They eventually made their way into the North Atlantic Ocean. Some washed up in Iceland. According to oceanographers, the ducks are now due to waddle ashore in New England and Canada.
The ducks' voyage is teaching oceanographers some lessons about currents, including how trash and ocean pollution travel. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said the oceanographer tracking the ducks. ""It just goes somewhere else.""
To help with the research, The First Years, the company that owns the plastic toys, is offering a $100 savings bond for any duck that is returned by the end of the year. The ducks' color has faded, but there is a way to identify the plastic creatures. They are stamped with the words
Not just any duck will do. It has to be from the First Years flock! Believe it or not, many toy ducks are floating around the ocean. They are often left over from duck-race fundraisers. To learn more about the ducks, visit

252,462,"Where does famous TV puppet Howdy Doody belong? That was the question that a court in Hartford, Connecticut, had to answer. The court recently decided that Howdy belongs to a museum in Detroit, Michigan.
, the first children's TV show seen across the country. The show was aired between 1947 and 1960. It featured host Buffalo Bob and his sidekick puppet, Howdy Doody.
When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy.
However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate.

253,227,"The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
What are some ways to prevent wildfires?
Few plants or animals live on the icy mountaintops in southern Argentina and Chile. The region is cold, desolate, and snowy.
The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers.
are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land.
Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions.
Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology.
Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth.""
As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities.
What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from
are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature.
The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called
It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming.
Some scientists say that people contribute to Earth's warmer temperatures. Harmful gases are released into the air when people burn certain fuels for electricity or for driving cars.
To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist.
Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move.
As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land.
What are some ways people can help prevent global warming?
Over hundreds and thousands of years, glaciers create different landforms, such as lakes.

255,577,"Scientists recently confirmed that large, mysterious bones found near a river in San Jose, California, weren't those of any ordinary animal. They belonged to a Columbian mammoth, an elephant-like creature that roamed the area's grasslands between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. Those ancient animals weighed 10 tons and stood 13 feet tall.
Columbian mammoths were found throughout the southern half of North America 2 million years ago. They lived during the mild weather between
. An ice age was a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth.
Similar to elephants today, Columbian mammoths are believed to have had short gray hair. They are thought to be related to woolly mammothslarge animals with shaggy coats that lived during the Ice Age. Scientists don't know why either mammoth vanished.
This find marks the most complete mammoth skeleton ever discovered in California. Scientists will study the bones to learn more about these creatures. ""This is important because it creates a record of the animals that wandered the area,"" scientist Mark Goodwin told
. ""They are an important part of California history.""

256,308,"No, the 'iceman' isn't a villain from the Batman movies. At 5,300 years old, he's the world's oldest known mummy. Scientists recently thawed him out.
The iceman, called tzi (OET-see), was found frozen in 1991 on a
in Italy. A glacier is a large body of ice that moves slowly. tzi is now stored in a museum in Italy in a room that is usually kept at 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
Scientists recently increased the temperature in the room to thaw the iceman. They took samples of bone, blood, and teeth from tzi.

257,669,"One morning in February, 75,000 kids woke up to find that they had become U.S. citizens. The kids, who were all adopted from other countries, became citizens because of the Child Citizenship Act.
The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen.
Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens.
The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.

258,798,"One night in March, Daniel Calderone, age 12, was doing his homework in his California home. Then the lights went out, and he knew he wouldn't finish his assignment.
Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through
, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time.
Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said.
The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs.
This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise.
Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy.
""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills.""

259,203,"The Mayon volcano in the Philippines has roared dangerously to life. A
is an opening in Earths surface through which molten rock, ash, and other materials blast out. Volcanoes erupt because of a buildup of heat and pressure deep within Earth. Volcanoes occur where Earths plates push together or pull apart.
For weeks, Mayon has threatened thousands of people who live near the volcano. Repeated eruptions of hot ash and fiery lava have destroyed crops and forests. Experts warn that more violent eruptions could happen at any time.
Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines. Scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted within the last 10,000 years. A dormant volcano is ""sleeping"" but is expected to erupt in the future. An extinct volcano is not expected to erupt again.
Why might a volcano not erupt for years and years?

260,340,"Astronomers have decided that eight is the magic number when it comes to our solar system. The eight planets now include Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto belongs in a new class referred to as dwarf planets. The decision was made to create the new category because powerful telescopes have let scientists find more and more Pluto-like objects in space.
Jupiter is the largest planet. It is 88,846 miles wide.
Mercury has the fastest orbit around the sun. It moves almost 30 miles a second.
Venus is the hottest planet. Its average surface temperature is 867 degrees.
the largest asteroid, was discovered in 1801. Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun. Most lie in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
the frozen dwarf, is located 4 billion miles from the sun. Charon, Plutos largest moon, was found in 1978.
2003 UB313 is a large object discovered in 2003. Nicknamed ""Xena,"" it is larger than Pluto and orbits in the Kuiper belt, an outer area of our solar system.
OK, now that Pluto is gone from the planet lineup, what memory trick will school kids use to remember the names and order of the eight planets? Heres one mnemonic device: My Very Excellent Mother Just Sent Us Nachos. Now its your turn. E-mail your ideas to ed4@weeklyreader.com and well post some entries online.

261,131,"A baby aardvark readies for its television close-up. The animal, nearly 3 weeks old, sniffed the lens of a television camera during its first public appearance at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. It was the first baby aardvark born at the zoo.
The baby is growing quickly! Although it weighed just 3 pounds at birth, its weight had nearly doubled by the time of its debut. The aardvark is a long-eared, long-nosed, hairless animal that is
, or active at night. In the wild, aardvarks live in Africa.

262,120,"There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered.
Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long.
The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food.
A posted sign warns boaters that manatees are in the area.
High-speed boats are one of the major threats facing manatees. Manatees are slow swimmers. They have trouble getting out of the way of a roaring speedboat. As a result, speedboats have often slammed into manatees, injuring or killing the sea creatures.
Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live.
The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say.
Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years.
Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals? Discuss in class and let us know at

2 charts like the one below (one for you and the other for a friend)
To play, players take turns rolling the die for seven rounds, filling in their charts after each turn. To fill in your chart, write the number rolled in either the tens or the ones column. Put a zero in the other column. Keep track of your running total. For example, if you roll a 6, you can write either:
The player whose total is closest to 100, without going over, wins. Be careful! Use the tens column wisely, or you'll go over 100!

264,385,"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million
. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys.
Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton.
Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog.
A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time.
The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India.
Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also
, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines.
A Sri Lanka government official told me what a huge effect Wyoming and other mine-sniffing dogs will make in his country.
He said, ""The best part of the CHAMPS program will be when all the land mines have been removed.""
In what other ways do dogs help humans?

265,496,"It's hatching time. About every three years, female rattlesnakes lay eggs. Those eggs hatch between August and October, when the baby snakes break through their soft shells and start to slither around.
Baby rattlesnakes don't have rattles until weeks after they hatch. The rattles form over time as the snakes repeatedly shed their skin.
A baby rattlesnake sheds its skin for the first time about two weeks after it hatches. A rattlesnake shakes its rattle to warn other animals that it is nearby.
Many baby rattlesnakes don't live to become adults. Because of the babies' small size, other animals
on them, or eat them. Raccoons, hawks, and many other animals eat baby rattlesnakes. If a rattlesnake lives to become an adult, it can grow to be 6 feet long and live for 20 to 30 years.

266,261,"Manatees often graze in shallow waters off the coast of Florida. These seadwelling plant eaters play with divers and swimmers. The huge animals are often called sea cows because of their large size.
Manatees were once thought to be on the edge of
or dying out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000.
As a result, Florida recently removed the manatee from its list of
Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out.
The first laws protecting this slow-moving marine mammal were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made hunting, capturing, or killing manatees illegal.
As Floridas human population grew, however, manatees faced more threats. Last year alone, 396 manatees died in Florida, according to the states Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Many manatees have been injured or killed in collisions with boats. Others have gotten tangled in fishing gear. Manatees are also threatened because of the loss of their
As builders develop along the coastline, they destroy the manatees natural homes.
Environmental factors, such as red tide, have also taken their toll on the playful creatures. Red tide occurs when millions of tiny organisms are present in an area of the water. Those tiny organisms turn the ocean red and brown. Some of them are harmful to fish and other animals.
Red tide occurs naturally in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, more than 80 manatees were killed in red-tide outbreaks.
Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many wildlife experts worry that the unusual mammals will not receive the same protection they had in the past. ""We cant celebrate yet,"" warned manatee expert Patrick Rose in an interview with
State officials say that the manatee is not under urgent threat. Although the huge creatures are being removed from Floridas list, state scientists say that the animal will remain protected under the nations Endangered Species Act. That law offers special protection to animals and plants facing extinction.
Wildlife officials say protection of the manatees might even be strengthened. The next step calls for the writing of a plan to continue increasing the number of manatees. ""There will be no less protection,"" says Henry Cabbage of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
A manatee recently got a taste of the Big Apple. Manatees are rarely seen far from the warm coastal waters of Florida, but one adventurous sea cow swam north to waters off New York City this summer. The large marine visitor then swam to waterways about 25 miles inland. Wildlife officials say its not unusual for manatees to
or move from one place to another. However, the mammals typically dont go much farther north than Virginia.
Should manatees have been removed from Floridas endangered species list? Why or why not?

267,514,"Does your puppy groove to the song ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Does your cat purr when you pump up the volume? Does your bunny thump to the hip-hop beat? Thanks to DogCatRadio.com, pets can rock out to a new online radio station devoted just to them.
The radio station is the pet project of record producer Adrian Martinez of Los Angeles, California. He started the station so dogs, cats, birds, and other animals can be entertained while theyre home alone. The owner of six dogs and two cats, Martinez got the idea from his cat Snickers. He noticed that Snickers was calmer when music was playing. Pets can be less lonely while they rock out to tunes from artists such as Snoop Dogg, Bow Wow, the Stray Cats, and Pet Shop Boys.

268,258,"The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles.
The disease attacks an infected bird's brain and spinal cord.
At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird.
In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year.
Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased.
By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild.
Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said.
Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said.
While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782.
Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol.
""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird"".

269,646,"Recently, Judy Leden strapped a pair of wings on her back. Then she ran as fast as she could down a hill. As she ran, the wings slowly lifted Leden off the ground. Soon she was soaring through the sky.
The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds.
The plans for Leden's flight were 500 years in the making, but she was airborne for a fraction of a minute.
The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance.
One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine.
Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider.
Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story.
A glider based on drawings made by Leonardo da Vinci recently flew.
Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance.
A glider does not have an engine.
Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds.
No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider.
Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!""

. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal lives. For their research, scientists studied fish called three-spined sticklebacks that live in rivers and streams in England.

272,456,"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed.
Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death.
During the ceremony, Alexander, a descendant of a slave who worked at Mount Vernon, told visitors, ""I hope you all feel, as I do, a sense of joy, a sense of sadness but also a sense of hope that the contributions of good people will always be remembered.""
Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told
that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said.
When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves.
During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave.
In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom.""
To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves.
Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it.

273,347,"With a dino-like head, this fierce ancient crocodile might have looked like the computer image (above the skull), scientists say.
Scientists have reported the discovery of a terrifying ancient sea creature. The 13-foot-long monster appears to be part crocodile and part T. rex. The creature likely roamed the Pacific Ocean about 135 million years ago, during the Age of the Dinosaurs. Scientists nicknamed the crocodile ""Godzilla,"" after the film monster.
of the skull, scientists created a computer image of Godzilla. Fossils are ancient remains of plants and animal preserved in rock. The crocs fossil was discovered in 1996 in Argentina, a country in South America. After studying the fossil for 10 years, scientists recently published their research.
Unlike other ocean crocs of the time, Godzilla had a short, high snout and a mouthful of large, jagged teeth for devouring other animals. Other crocodiles had long, thin snouts and smaller teeth. Scientists say Godzilla was a top ocean
an animal that feeds on other animals. It most likely dined on other large creatures rather than small fish. ""We are calling him the chico malobad boy of the ocean,"" says one of the researchers.

274,219,"Have you ever closed your eyes and tried to walk from one end of a room to the other? It's hard. Now, imagine running a race with your eyes closed. That's similar to what running is like for Maria Runyan.
Runyan, age 31, is legally blind. She is the first legally blind athlete to qualify for a U.S. Olympic team. She is competing in the 1,500-meter running race in Sydney.
Runyan has had Stargardt's disease since she was 9 years old. As a result of that disease, Runyan can't see much of anything in the center of her vision.
""I never said I wanted to be the first legally blind runner to make the Olympics,"" Runyan said after making the team. ""I just wanted to be an Olympian. I don't ever see my vision as a barrier.""

275,802,"North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site, viewed from space in February 2002
In late January, officials fro South Korea traveled to North Korea. Both countries are located in eastern Asia. The reason for their visit was to try get North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms.
Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity.
However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust.
North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people.
Area: 46,500 square miles (about the size of Mississippi)
Economy: many children and families are starving
Area: 38,000 square miles 9about the size of Indiana)
Economy: it has the fourth largest economy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The United States is working with countries in the region, such as South Korea, to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear crisis. South Korea was hoping to help the United States negotiate a peaceful solution. However, officials in North Korea want to discuss the issue directly with the United States.
U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat.
North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea.

will capture photos from Pluto. It will also gather information from objects in the Kuiper Belt, the mysterious region on the fringes of our solar system.
Very little is known about Pluto, currently the farthest planet from the sun. The tiny planet is one-sixth the size of Earth. It is more than 3 billion miles away, much too far to be seen in detail with a telescope from Earth. Pluto is the only planet that has not been explored by a spacecraftuntil now.
In late January, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched the
spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The space probe is now speeding toward Pluto. ""The United States of America has just made history by launching the first spacecraft to explore Pluto,"" mission expert Alan Stern said at launch time.
or scientists who study space, hope they will soon have much more information about the planet that lies on the edge of our solar system. New Horizons will fly by Pluto to take photos and study the icy planet. All the information it gathers will be beamed back to Earth.
will reach Pluto in July 2015. The 1,054-pound spacecraft will get as close as 6,200 miles from Plutos surface.
which is about the size of a grand piano, will also use its powerful cameras to capture images of Plutos moon, Charon. The probe will then zoom beyond Pluto and take pictures of the
The Kuiper Belt is a region that orbits the sun in the far reaches of the solar system. It is filled with thousands of rocky, icy objects.
Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper Belt are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago. Researchers hope the images will provide clues to how the solar system was created.
The nine and a half years it will take
to reach Pluto will be a long wait for scientists, but they say it will be worth it. ""This is one of the most important regions of the solar system,"" says mission expert Hal Weaver. ""It hasnt been explored yet, and
is going to be the first mission to go out there and look at it up close and personal.""

279,540,"Hawaii has reason to celebrate! The state welcomed its baseball champs home after they won the Little League World Series in late August.
That victory marked the first time a team from Hawaii has won a Little League world championship. Hawaii's West Oahu of Ewa Beach team defeated a team from Curaao, a country in the Caribbean, 76.
It was not an easy win. Curaao was the defending champ. The game went into extra innings. Hawaii came back from three runs down to tie the game. It was the first time a championship had gone into extra innings since 1971.
The championship game was played in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, before more than 25,000 fans. (Little League Baseball began in Pennsylvania in 1939.)
Michael Memea, 12, of Hawaii cracked the game-winning home run. ""I knew it was gone,"" he later said proudly.

280,784,"North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia.
Two brothers crept carefully through the mountains in China. The boys, along with their mother, sister, and aunt, had fled their home in North Korea. They hoped to find a better life in South Korea.
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed.
The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year.
They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year.
Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death.
About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives.
Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons.
Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people.
South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants.
Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games.
North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty.
The brothers tell me about their plans for the future. Young Hoon wants to be a pilot. Young Jun wants to help people. They also hope to do something they never could have even dreamed of while living in North Korea--they want to visit the United States.
Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.

281,696,"History in the Making: Three Days of Peace and Music
Woodstock was a large music festival held in the rural town of Bethel, New York, in 1969. At that time, the United States was divided over the war in Vietnam and the struggle for civil rights. Adam interviewed Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the concert.
When did you come up with the idea for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair?
In the winter of 1968. I was 23 or 24.
How did you get big stars to come to the concert?
Woodstock sounded like an event nobody wanted to miss, and the name Woodstock in those days was known. It was the home of Bob Dylan, Janice Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and other cultural icons. Initially, it was all about making everyone believe that these people were going to come and that I could get everyone to come. Soon, through word of mouth, bands were calling us.
Did you have any idea that so many people would show up?
In the beginning, we planned on 200,000, but officially we were trying to get a permit for only 50,000. In the end, we had somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000, but more than 1 million who tried to come were turned away. They had to close the [New York State] Thruway and the Canadian border.
Why did you choose Woodstock as the site, and why did you decide to keep the name Woodstock even after you ended up holding the festival 60 miles away, in Bethel?
We had to move to Bethel because we could not find a largeenough place in Woodstock. A lot of people tried to convince me to change the name [of the festival] to Bethel, but I felt the name reflected the spirit of what we were trying to do, which was to create an atmosphere of artistic community. Woodstock always stood for that.
Why are people still talking about Woodstock today?
What made Woodstock unique was how many people came and how well they treated each other. The world was shocked to discover that a crowd of more than 500,000 could live together for three days in a field and treat each other with love and respect. This was set against a backdrop of the war in Vietnam, ... a battle for civil rights and women's rights, and a yearning for peace in the world. The people who came to Woodstock accomplished all of these things, at least for that period of time, so it gave people hope for their future.
The interview taught me that a lot of musicians were activists. I also learned that no matter how prepared you are, you also have to

282,605,"Soaring high above California's coastline stand the magnificent redwood trees. Redwoods are the world's tallest known trees and are also some of the oldest. Some scientists are concerned about a disease that is threatening the ancient giants. It is called sudden oak death.
The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park.
Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives.
The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern.
Coastal redwoods can grow upwards of 360 feet. Some are taller than the Statue of Liberty, which stands about 300 feet.
The diameter of redwoods can measure about 20 feet.
Named California's state tree, the redwood can live more than 2,000 years.
In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a national monument dedicated to protecting and preserving the mighty redwoods.
In 1904, a fungus from Asia began killing chestnut trees in New York. Over the next 50 years, the disease killed about 3.5 billion trees and almost wiped out an entire species. Scientists want to prevent this from happening in California or elsewhere in the United States.
Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread.""

283,132,"Aquarius: An Underwater Lab With A View
Many U.S. kids share their bedrooms with a brother or sister. Sharing a room can be a pain. In October, six scientists squeezed into a small underwater laboratory to study a coral reef. They worked and slept in the tiny space for ten days. They, too, found that sharing space isn't easy.
""I've been on missions where people snored,"" said Celia Smith, who led the mission in October. ""You just kind of kick their bunk and try to get to sleep before they do.""

says the best part of living there is the view. They can see colorful fish swimming in the nearby reef. Smith said it's hard to tell, though, whether the aquanauts are watching the fish or the fish are watching the aquanauts.
The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory.
Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said.
Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs.
Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say.
Overfishing, pollution, and global warming are destroying many coral reefs, scientists explain. For example, global warming has gradually warmed the shallow ocean waters where coral reefs usually form. The warmer water has killed many

Scientist Valerie Paul worries that all the world's coral reefs will be destroyed early this century. ""It is like losing the rain forests all at once,"" she said.

285,216,"Central Florida cleans up after the first tornadoes of 2007.
The windy season in Florida began in a big way. Residents of four counties are recovering after a series of destructive
ripped through central Florida, killing 20 people, damaging hundreds of homes, and cutting off power to more than 20,000 people. A tornado is a powerful, rotating tube of air that runs from the ground to a thundercloud. The recent tornado was so strong that it lifted a moving tractor-trailer off the ground and dropped it onto another truck. Fortunately, neither driver was seriously hurt. The drivers did, however, find out how powerful a tornado can be!
Tunnel of Fury: How A Tornado Forms
The strongest tornadoes develop from powerful, large-scale thunderstorms called
. The Florida tornadoes were created by supercell storms.
 Supercells are created when fronts of warm, moist air collide with cold, dry air.
 The opposing warm and cold gusts of air create a rotating column of rising wind called a
 When the funnelshaped cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
During the recent Florida tornadoes, winds reached speeds of more than 150 miles per hour. The storms were rated EF-3 on the
Scientists use the scale to measure the size and strength of tornadoes. The scale ranges from EF-0, the weakest, and EF-5, the strongest (with winds of more than 200 miles per hour).
Average number of tornadoes reported each year in the United States:
Length of damage trail a tornado can leave: up to
Tornado time span: up to one hour, but most tornadoes last less than

286,494,". If you think those words are spoken only by adults who wear suits and work on Wall Street, think again. Some of today's investors wear baggy pants and T-shirts and ride skateboards. In other words, they're kids! About 5 million U.S. kids ages 12 to 17 don't just stash their money in piggy banks or savings accounts. They invest in the stock market.
A stock market is a place to buy and sell
of stock in all kinds of companies. Owning a share of stock means you own a small piece of a company. The more shares you own, the more of a company you own.
, or use their money to buy stocks, in the stock market are called
. If a company makes money, it may pay investors
, or some of the company's profits. Another way investors make money is by selling their shares of stock at a price higher than the price they paid when they bought shares of the company's stock.
Making money in the stock market may seem easy, but it's risky. Investors can lose money when a stock's price drops.
That's why financial experts say kids should learn about a company before investing in it. One expert suggests that kids start by investing in companies that make products they use.
Eric Olson, age 17, has been investing since he was 13 years old. He says kids should ""read everything on investing--books, magazine articles, the business pages of [the] newspaper."" As kids read, investing will be easier to understand, Eric said.

287,725,"Take me out to the... art museum? Yes, you've heard right! Baseball is being honored with a new art exhibit. The exhibit, ""The Perfect Game: America Looks at Baseball,"" celebrates our national pastime. It is being shown at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City.
To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items.
""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren told
when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art.""
Warren says that Jackie Robinson is depicted on many objects, more than any other baseball player. In 1947, Jackie Robinson made history. He became the first African American baseball player in the major leagues when he joined the Dodgers. At that time, the Dodgers were located in Brooklyn. Today, they are in Los Angeles.
""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model.""
The exhibit runs through February 1, 2004

288,64,"Environmental experts are working hard to clean up beaches in Spain. Spain and Portugal are two countries in Europe. Some of their beaches are covered with oil that leaked from a tanker called the
A storm with high winds and waves pounded the tanker in the middle of November. During the storm, the
began to leak. Nearly 2 million gallons of oil leaked into the Atlantic Ocean.
Oil from the tanker formed a huge slick on the ocean. Much of the oil washed up on nearby beaches. It covered at least 150 miles of coastline, killing fish, birds, and other animals. Some experts say cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches could take years.
A few days after the tanker began leaking oil, it broke in half. After the tanker broke apart, its
, or front, remained on the ocean surface for several hours. The ship sank about 150 miles off the coast of Spain.
About 18 million gallons of oil are still inside the ship. The weight of the ocean water pressing on the ship could cause the oil tanks on the ship to explode, spewing oil across the ocean floor. Even if the oil tanks don't explode, they will rust and leak.
""[The ship is] a time bomb at the bottom of the sea,"" said one expert. ""There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil.""

289,336,"On her TV show, Judge Judy Sheindlin makes difficult decisions concerning the cases she hears. Now the judge has written a book that aims to help kids make tough decisions.
You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover
, the judge presents situations that kids might find themselves in at school. She then offers some solutions but lets kids make their own decisions.
talked with Judge Judy. Here is what she had to say about her TV show and her book.
: How did you come up with the situations in your book?
Judge Judy: I developed them from real-life situations. I'm a grandmother. I asked my grandkids about the situations. I also tried to relate to kids and let them know that what they do now will affect them in their adult lives. This advice will, I hope, help them make the right choices.
: Compared to the past, are things different for kids today?
: Today, we live in a society that has both parents working. Working parents don't always spend enough time with their kids. Kids need parents who talk to them.
: How did you come up with the title for your book?
: Titles say a lot. You can't judge life by its cover. You shouldn't judge people by their covers--how they look or how they dress. You wouldn't want people to do that to you.
: What's the one piece of advice you would give to fourth graders?
: You should always think about what the right thing to do is--not what feels good, not what your friends are doing. If you think about what the right thing to do is, then eventually the right thing happens, and you sleep better at night.
: Your dog is pictured on the cover of your book. What's its name?

Cassini is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings.
Scientists have uncovered some of Saturn's secrets. Researchers recently learned that the planet's famous rings have changed during the past 25 years. The information has been collected from tools aboard the
, or circling, the ringed planet last year.
is studying Saturn and capturing pictures of its rings. Its ring bands are named with the letters
. The rings, however, are not in alphabetical order. They were assigned a letter in the order in which they were discovered.
One of the most surprising finds is that parts of Saturn's innermost ringthe D ringhave grown dimmer since 1981. In addition, the D ring has moved 125 miles closer to Saturn.
What do these new discoveries mean? Scientists aren't sure, but hope the discoveries will reveal clues about the age of the rings around the sixth planet from the sun. ""I don't think Saturn's rings will disappear anytime soon, but this tells us how the rings are [changing] and how long they might last,"" says Linda Spilker, a scientist with the U.S. space agency, NASA.
Although Saturn's rings appear solid, they are actually made up of pieces of rock, ice, and dust. Those pieces vary from the size of tiny dust particles to the size of large mountains.
Scientists are also studying the shimmering rings to learn more about how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. They say that Saturn's rings are a model of the gas and dust that once surrounded the sunthe center of the solar system.
The image of Enceladus was taken by the
spacecraft. Enceladus is one of Saturn's 47 known moons. The red areas appear to be craters and ridges on the icy moon's surface.
Other images revealed water vapor escaping from cracks on the moon. Water vapor indicates that Saturn has an
, a layer of air that surrounds a planet.
Tiny Enceladus now joins Mars and Jupiter's moon Europa as places in the solar system that may have liquid water beneath their surfaces. Water is necessary for life to exist.

291,151,"or the NBA playoffs? The TV-Turnoff Network wants you to do just thatand imagine what you can do instead of watching TV.
As a result, the theme of TV-Turnoff Week is ""Imagine."" The celebration takes place from April 24 to April 30. During the weeklong event, TV-Turnoff officials hope to raise awareness about the harmful effects of too much television.
Each American watches, on average, more than four hours of television per day, according to RealVision and the TV-Turnoff Network. In fact, kids spend more time in front of the television (1,023 hours per year) than in school (900 hours per year)!
Experts say that too much time in front of the TV can have a negative effect on children. Kids dont do as well in school and dont get enough exercise to stay in shape.
Robert Kesten, executive director of the TV-Turnoff Network, hopes that kids will turn off the television and get involved with other interests. ""Turning off the television allows children to see the real world,"" Kesten told
""We think kids will be surprised with the new discoveries they will make if they choose to shut off the TV for a week.""

294,625,"Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
A happy ending took place off the southern coast of Florida in August. Five pilot whales were released back into the ocean. Pilot whales are members of the dolphin family.
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together.
Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears.
Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.
""Walt Disney couldn't write a story better than this,"" said one animal-care worker.

295,769,"Police officers in several towns in Massachusetts are pulling drivers over and giving them presents.
The officers have started Buckle Up for Bucks, a program that rewards people who wear their seat belts. Officers reward people who wear seat belts by handing out doughnuts and raffle tickets for savings bonds.
""It works,"" said police officer John Janulewicz. ""If we can get them [people] in the habit of buckling up, it will reduce injuries."" The police say the number of people who wear seat belts has gone up by 10 percent.

296,765,"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs.
Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said.
Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots.
Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level.
The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects.
The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve.
Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state.""
Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said.
However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control.""

297,687,"While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg.
Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash.
Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue.
The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare.
The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred
Scientists say some species of sharks can live up to 50 years.
The largest shark, the whale shark, can be 50 feet long.
Shark skeletons have no bones. The skeleton is made of a tough substance called
Not all sharks are meat eaters. Basking sharks, for example, eat
, tiny plants and animals that float in water. As a result, basking sharks don't have teeth.
Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out.""
One reason that shark attacks may seem more common than before is that more people are using shorelines for recreation, said George Burgess of ISAF.
Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food.
Some shark experts say sharks should fear people, not the other way around.
One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is
. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup.
Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it.
U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said.

298,533,"After nearly two decades of rest, a sleeping giant has started to awaken. Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top.
""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,""
. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes.
In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large
, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii.

Steam blasts from a crater on Mount St. Helens in October 2004.
Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better
Mount St. Helens is located in Washington.
Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood.
Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano.
Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time.
How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger.
Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called
are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts.
Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of
. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called
when it pours out of the volcano.
As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger.
More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe.
""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives.""
Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?

How exactly does a new word make its way into the dictionary? It takes about 10 to 20 years for a new word to become a common term used by a lot of people.
Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system.
Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!

301,507,"Many people can learn a lesson in good sportsmanship from a Florida Little League team. After losing the Little League World Series to Japan in late August, Florida players didn't sulk. Instead, they were all smiles as they joined Japan's players at the end of the game to celebrate.
""We're number one in the United States, and that's fine with me,"" one Florida player told the
newspaper. ""I felt happy for them,"" he said, referring to the players from the winning team.
A team from Japan has won the Little League World Series three times in the last five years. This year, a team from Tokyo beat Boynton Beach, Florida, 10-1.
The championship game was played in Pennsylvania in front of 41,000 stadium fans. Neither team scored until the fourth inning when Japan brought home eight runs, which included a

Little League Baseball began in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, in 1939, with 45 boys playing on three teams.

302,617,"Sierra Negra erupts on the Galpagos Islands for the first time in 26 years.
Tortoises and other unique wildlife are safe after a volcano erupts on the Galpagos Islands.
RED ALERT Sierra Negra erupts on the Galpagos Islands for the first time in 26 years.
The Galpagos Islands are home to wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. Here, the islands famous giant tortoises and other unique wildlife roam freely. People were worried that those wildlife were harmed after a volcano on Isabela, the largest of the Galpagos Islands, erupted.
The nearly mile-high volcano, called Sierra Negra, sent three scorching rivers of
pouring down the mountainside toward the Pacific Ocean. Lava is red-hot, molten rock that comes out of a volcano. (See
The three lava flows, however, were not a threat to the people or the plants and animals on Isabela, according to island officials. ""The situation is not risky,"" confirms Pablo Gordillo, the mayor of a small village on the island.
The Galpagos Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean. They rest about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, a country in South America. The
(ar-kuh- PEH-luh-goh), or small group of islands, belongs to Ecuador. In 1835, scientist Charles Darwin arrived on the islands aboard a ship called the Beagle. He spent weeks investigating the areas diverse plants and animals.(See
A volcano is a mountain with an opening on top. When a volcano is active,
(hot, liquid rock) deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure causes magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the
or openings, at the top and sides of the volcano. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called
Once lava cools, it hardens into rock.
Tourist centers near the active volcano were closed as a safety measure during the volcanic eruptions. But visitors to the island could still get a sneak peak. ""We have opened an observation post near the site for tourists so that visitors can observe this natural spectacle,"" says Gordillo.
A giant tortoise and a colorful frigate bird inhabit Galpagos island.
Scientist Charles Darwin was fascinated that each small island on the Galpagos had its own distinct species of tortoises, lizards, and birds.
are huge turtles that weigh up to 500 pounds and can live up to 150 years.
are large lizards that can weigh up to 15 pounds. These slow movers live in drier parts of the islands.
are one of the oldest species of birds. Male frigates have a patch of red skin at their throats.

303,280,"The grizzly and cubs may soon be taken off the endangered species list in the Northwest.
Grizzly bears are considered one of the great symbols of the American wilderness. When explorers Lewis and Clark traveled west in the early 1800s, they found a healthy grizzly-bear population.
At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A
is the place in nature where an animal makes its home.
Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s.
Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct.
Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection].""
Why is it important to protect endangered animals?
Scientists have worked to help bring grizzlies back from the brink of extinction. They set the animals free in their original habitats. They also plan to limit the number of roads in areas where grizzlies live. That action will give grizzlies more room to roam-and will help make life more bearable for them!

304,314,"Lighten Up! Most students carry too much weight in their backpacks.
A new study shows that kids need to lessen their backpack loads.
Chances are youre carrying a heavy burdentoo much weight in your backpack. A new study warns that American kids need to reduce their backpack loads and spread out the weight.
Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have shown that too much pressure from an overloaded backpack may cause shoulder pain. In addition, an uneven backpack load may lead to pain in the lower back.
Five girls and five boysall 13 years oldparticipated in the study. The kids wore identical backpacks, fitted on the shoulder straps with measuring devices called pressure sensors.
The children first carried 10 percent of their body weight, then 20 percent, and finally 30 percent. With each increase, the kids reported that their pain worsened.
According to previous studies, children typically carry loads that are about 22 percent of their body weight. The new study confirmed that 22 percent of body weight is too high.
Each year an estimated 7,500 emergency room visits result from injuries related to backpacks and book bags, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The researchers hope their information will encourage backpack makers to design wide, well-padded shoulder straps to help spread the weight.
The researchers also hope the results of their study will encourage kids to
or lessen, their loads. ""The weight in the backpack should be minimized as much as possible,"" Brandon Macias, one of the studys lead authors, told
Here are some tips to help you wear your backpack safely.
Dont carry more than 15 percent of your body weight. This means that if you weigh 100 pounds, you should not wear a backpack heavier than 15 pounds.
Choose a backpack that is the right size for your body.
Pack only what you need, and load heaviest items closest to your back.
Always wear both shoulder straps, and fasten the waist strap to balance the backpacks weight evenly.
Adjust shoulder and waist straps so the backpack fits snugly to your body and the weight is evenly balanced.
If your backpack is too heavy, consider using a book bag on wheels, if your school allows it.

305,121,"New York City Subway: Then and Now
New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is a billionaire who could take a limousine to work. Instead, he rides the subway to his office at City Hall each morning.
""A hundred years ago, a generation of New Yorkers had the courage and conviction to build a subway system that transformed our city,"" said Mayor Bloomberg. ""Today our subway is the backbone of New York.""
On October 27, 2004, New York City marked the
, or hundredth anniversary, of its subway system with special ceremonies. As part of the celebration, people took tours to retrace the original 9.1-mile route from City Hall to Harlem.
Construction began on the subway in 1900 and took 12,000 workers four years to complete. At that time, the population of New York City was 3.4 million and growing. People, horse-drawn carriages, trolleys, and vendors packed city streets.

Left: City Hall subway station c1900-1906; right: Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge subway station, around 1904.
City officials believed that a subway system would help people get around faster and allow them to move into outer areas. What started out as one subway line with 28 stations has grown into 26 lines with 468 stations. A fare in 1904 cost only a nickel. Today, about 4.5 million people ride the subway daily and pay $2 a ride.
The subway has seen plenty of change since 1904. Over the years, workers have restored many old subway stations. They have found mosaics and murals hidden under dirt.
Public artwork now graces 140 subway stations as part of the Art for Transit program. ""You can probably say that the New York subway system is one of the largest art museums in the world,"" Roxanne Robertson of the New York Transit Museum told

307,550,"A filmmaker finds out that elephant families can be comfortable with visitors.
""I started thinking of them as a family almost immediately,"" filmmaker Martyn Colbeck told
He was talking about wild elephants, not his next-door neighbors. For more than 15 years, Colbeck has filmed a family of African elephants in Amboseli National Reserve in eastern Africa.
airs April 1 on the PBS television show
The new film comes after recent studies found that elephants can recognize their reflection in a mirror. That is something only humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins were thought to be able to do. ""These animals are smart,"" Colbeck says. His documentary shows just how intelligent African elephantsthe world's largest land animalsare.
Colbeck's film follows an elephant family led by a 62-year-old female elephant named Echo. In the wild, African elephants live in herds. They roam long distances to find food. The oldest female elephant, called the
leads the herd. Adult male elephants live separately from the females and the young calves.
Echo guides her family to fresh water and food while staying alert for danger. The young elephants are the most
or at risk of being harmed. Colbeck witnessed that danger when he saw another elephant family attempt to kidnap Echo's calf Ebony. Echo gathered the other adult female elephants in her family to come to the rescue. ""Together they plowed into the kidnappers to recover Ebony,"" Colbeck explained. ""It showed forethought and teamwork.""
During his years of filmmaking, Colbeck observed other signs of elephant intelligence. Elephants communicate with each other through low rumbling sounds that people often cannot hear. Family members also make distinct sounds that other members can recognize.
or customs. After an elephant dies, the other family members cover the body with sticks and leaves and linger near the site for days. The animals often return to the site years later.
Amboseli National Reserve covers about 150 square miles in southern Kenya, near the Tanzania border. The Kenyan government protects the nature reserve's elephants from
or illegal hunting. Elephants have been hunted throughout history for the ivory in their tusks. Humans have used ivory to make jewelry and other objects. Today, elephants are an endangered species.
Since strict anti-poaching laws were put into effect in 1968, the number of elephants in Amboseli has risen from 500 to more than 1,200. When Colbeck began filming Echo's family in 1990, the family had only 14 members. Today it has 30 members.
Although the elephants still face some danger from the local Masai tribespeople, the creatures have become remarkably comfortable around human visitors. That makes Amboseli an ideal place for scientists to study elephant behavior.
""The elephants are totally relaxed about having vehicles in amongst the herd,"" says Colbeck. ""Nevertheless, it is still very important to respect the animals and not disturb them.  That respect develops into a trust, and in that way we have been able to document some extraordinary moments in their lives."" That trust has not only allowed Colbeck to film Echo's family, but it has also made him feel like one of the family.
The elephant families in Amboseli National Reserve are organized alphabetically. Echo's family is the ""E"" family, so every member of the family is given a name starting with
Here's how Echo fits in with some of her relatives.
(age 62): Echo is one of the oldest elephants in Amboseli. She is the leader of her family. You can tell that she is old by the length of her tusks. They are almost touching! Wild African elephants live an average of 60 years.

308,89,"Fingerprint technology has a new home  in the cafeteria.
Talk about easy money! Students in Rome, Georgia, can now pay for cafeteria food with a touch of the finger. The Rome City School District has a new, high-tech payment system that reads students fingerprints instead of asking students to punch in codes or swipe their ID cards.
""The finger scan system is faster,"" Rome superintendent Gayland Cooper told
""This is the kind of thing that technology should help us with.""
Before the new system, students often lost their lunch cards or forgot their codes. In addition, the cafeteria lines moved slowly, often cutting into students mealtimes.
The new fingerprint scanner has sped things up. ""Our students have really enjoyed the new system,"" Narkissa Ware, principal of Anna K. Davie Elementary School, told
""When the lines move faster, the students have more time to enjoy their meal.""
Getting a students fingerprints into the new system takes 10 minutes. After that, the student can touch the scanner at the cashier counter. The students picture and account information then appear on the computer screen.
Although fingerprints are an easy way to pay for lunch, some parents arent happy with the new system. Some students dont use the fingerprint scanner because their parents dont like the idea that their childrens fingerprints are being scanned daily.
Cooper says that students still have the option of punching in their codes. He adds, however, that students fingerprint information is secure.

Evacuees from areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in the Astrodome sports arena in Houston, Texas, September 6.
Will the Gulf Coast ever be the same?
back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina is going to be a challenge. It is expected to take months in some places, and in others, years.
Thousands of people who fled the storm weeks ago are still wondering when they can go homeif they still have a home. Across the country, other people are rebuilding their lives in new neighborhoods.
""The devastation is greater than our worst fears,"" says Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. ""It's just totally overwhelming.""
Officials are now developing plans to repair the roads, bridges, houses, and buildings the storm washed away. Congress approved billions of dollars in aid. Companies in the United States have donated millions to the relief efforts.
Government officials have also been working on providing housing, schools, and jobs to those who
or fled, New Orleans. ""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston, Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to.""
People from around the United States, along with those in other countries, are also reaching out to Katrina's victims. In Texas, schools opened their doors to students from the devastated communities.
In the city of Greenwood, Indiana, fourth-grade teacher Carol Edwards started a drive so her students at Southwest Elementary School could help those affected by Katrina. The class is collecting school supplies and clothing to send to a school that was damaged in the storm. Nine-year-old Alex Warford, a student in Edwards's class, says, ""I think it's a great idea because they lost all their things.""
A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean's surface. The air pressure drops, and the winds cause a mass of clouds to form around an eye. The eye is the calm center of the hurricane.
The rising air cools and condenses, and heavy rain falls. The eyewall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located there.

""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush after flying over the devastation. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time.""

310,41,"Recently, historians found an old well in Jamestown, Virginia.
Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump.
The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown.
The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims.
Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes.
Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America.
The ""garbage"" from the well is helping historians better understand how the colonists lived.
""When one stands at Jamestown today, it is hard to imagine how much hope, regret, fear, hatred, hunger, pain, and death were experienced at this place,"" historian Ivor Noel Hume wrote of the fort's earliest colonists.

If you have access to a computer, you can log on to the Internet to find information and go to places without ever leaving home.
The Net also has some sites that aren't so nice. Many stories in the news lately have been about kids who have gotten into trouble because they weren't careful about using the Net.
The number of kids who use the Net has exploded in the past few years. According to studies by eMarketer, an Internet company that studies who uses the Net, the number of U.S. kids between ages 5 and 13 going online at home will grow from 11 million in 1999 to 22 million in 2003.
Not all kids are surfing the Internet safely. Many kids are giving out information that they shouldn't reveal on the Net, such as their real last names, addresses, and phone numbers. Some kids have online conversations with people who mean them harm or could get them into trouble.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), you can have fun on the Net without putting yourself at risk if you stick to the following rules. The FBI says:
meet someone or have him or her visit you without your parents' permission.
your parents if you get an e-mail that makes you feel uncomfortable.

313,489,"Going, Going, Gone! African Monkey Declared Extinct
In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a
, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced.
No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Cte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal.
""If [the] red colobus were present near any of our survey routes, it is likely that we would have seen one,"" said scientist John Oates.
Scientists blame the animal's extinction on hunting and the destruction of the forests where it lived.
Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive.
Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh.
MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction].""

314,423,"Hua Mei isn't your typical California girl. Sure, she likes to eat, sleep, sit in her pool, and play. On hot days, she really likes to sit in her air-conditioned room. After all, Hua Mei is covered with black-and-white fur and weighs 150 pounds!
Hua Mei is a giant panda who celebrated her second birthday last week. Born on August 21, 1999, at the San Diego Zoo in California, Hua Mei is the only giant panda born in the United States to live more than four days.
When she was born, Hua Mei looked like a pink rat the size of a cell phone. She weighed only 4 ounces.
For two weeks after Hua Mei was born, her mother, Bai Yun, held on to her without ever letting go. Bai Yun was careful because she didn't want to crush Hua Mei. At the time, Bai Yun weighed 200 pounds!
Since Hua Mei's birth, millions of people have seen her. Thousands of people flock to her den each day.
""She's so cute,"" Rebecca Ralston, age 11, said after seeing the panda. ""She's like a big teddy bear.""
The giant panda is one of the rarest animals. As few as 1,000 pandas survive in the wild.
Giant pandas live only in the bamboo forests of China, which are being destroyed. Loggers have cut down vast areas of those forests. The trees are used for firewood and to make buildings. Farmers use the cleared forests to grow crops.
To protect the giant panda, China has set up 33
, or special protected areas. It is illegal to cut down trees and brush or hunt in the reserves. The reserves are helping to increase the number of pandas living in the wild.
Panda scientists at the San Diego Zoo say they want to help increase the number of pandas living in the wild. ""Someday, we may be able to raise pandas in captivity and release them to the wild,"" panda scientist Don Lyndberg told Weekly Reader. For now, pandas remain on the edge of extinction.

316,557,"From our planet, you can see Earth's single moon in the evening sky. Imagine living on a planet that has 17 moons! That's the number of moons that orbit Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Scientists spotted a 17th moon orbiting Jupiter while they were looking for comets.
Scientists say the newly discovered moon is 3 miles wide. It is the smallest of Jupiter's known moons. Scientists used to think that Leda, a moon discovered in 1974, was Jupiter's smallest moon. Leda is between 5 and 10 miles wide.
Scientists have not officially named the newly discovered moon yet. For now they are calling it S/1999 J1.

According to the Pentagon, 150,000 American troops served in the war against Iraq, and 130,000 troops remain overseas. The Pentagon houses the four branches of the U.S. military, which include the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force.
On November 11, many ceremonies will take place to thank the members of the U.S. military who helped remove Saddam Hussein from power. They will also remember veterans who served in other U.S. wars.
Master Sergeant Emma Krouser served in the 3rd Infantry Division that led the assault on Baghdad. She described her experience in Iraq this summer.
""The people were waving flags... and giving soldiers the thumbs-up sign,"" Krouser told

318,787,"Condoleezza Rice is the first African American woman to become secretary of state.
After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's
Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters.
Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters.
As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top
. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami.
Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were
, or separated, from white people in the South.
Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado.
Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice.
The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch.
The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions.
The chart shows the Cabinet departments in the order in which they were created.

319,654,"On November 2, voters will decide whom they want to be the next U.S. president. Will it be Republican George W. Bush or Democrat John Kerry? To find out what the candidates have to say about some of the election issues,
President George W. Bush is the Republican candidate.
Senator John Kerry is the Democratic candidate.
How do you plan to create a cleaner environment?
My administration has put in place some of the most important antipollution policies in a decade. I have a responsibility as the president to put people in my administration [who] understand the importance of conserving our natural resources and making them better.
As Americans, we have the right to breathe unpolluted air and drink safe water. Across America, we will guarantee all children access to clean, safe parks and baseball fields and take on traffic congestion. We will protect the health of all Americans by [improving air quality].
Both George W. Bush and John Kerry support the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law.
What will you do to make sure kids in the United States get the best education possible?
I believe every child can learn and every school must teach--so we passed the most important federal education [law] in history. Because we acted, children are making progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back.
Every child should be held to high standards. Every classroom should have a great teacher. Every young person should graduate [from] high school, and every young person who works hard and wants to go to college should be able to afford it.
What is your vision for the future of Iraq?
We're working closely with Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, as they move toward free elections and take increasing responsibility for their own affairs. Securing democracy in Iraq is the work of many hands.
Our military performed brilliantly in ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Having gone to war, we cannot afford to fail at peace. The United States must take immediate measures to prevent Iraq from becoming a failed state.
Although the presidential candidates have been in the spotlight, they aren't the only people running for office on Election Day. On November 2, Americans will also vote to elect members to
Congress is the branch of the U.S. government that makes the laws. It is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Just like the presidential candidates, most senators and representatives belong to either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.
The winners of the Senate and House elections can affect the balance of power between the two main political parties in Congress. That can impact which laws get passed.
All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for election this year. Representatives are elected to two-year terms. There is no limit to how many times they can run for reelection. Republicans have a 12-seat lead in the House. They have held the majority in Congress since 1994.
In the U.S. Senate, 34 of the 100 seats are up for election. Every state has two senators, who are elected for six-year terms. There is also no limit on how many terms a senator can serve. The Republican Party has a one-seat lead in the Senate.

320,69,"Winter is upon us, and that means snow in many parts of the country. Snow forms when water droplets in clouds freeze into ice crystals. Take a look at the five cities in the continental United States that average the most snowfall each year. Alaskas cities are not included because they would take over most of the list.Valdez, Alaska, tops the list as the snowiest city, with an average snowfall of 326 inches a year!
About how many more inches of snow a year do people in Marquette shovel than people in Syracuse?

321,361,"The Heat Is On: Will Global Warming Affect Animals?
Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water.
Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals.
Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit.
. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
As temperatures rise, more and more animals will have to
, or move, in order to survive, said scientist Jay Malcolm of the WWF.
Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100.
Here are some examples of how global warming is affecting some animals in North America.
The numbers on the map show where each animal can be found.
The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat.
The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch.
Global warming is actually helping some animals.
The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there.
For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward.
Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now.""
Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on
Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events.
Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming.

324,719,"There is good news for rhinos. Wildlife experts recently discovered the tracks of 13 Sumatran rhinos in Borneo, an island in Southeast Asia. The number thrilled scientists because the animals are on the verge of extinction.
Sumatran rhinos have been hunted illegally for their horns, which are prized in traditional Asian medicine. Wildlife groups are working to stop illegal hunting and protect the endangered creatures. The Sumatran rhino is one of three species of endangered Asian rhinos left in the wild.
True or false? There are eight times as many Indian rhinos as Sumatran rhinos.

325,753,"Does the classic tale about a woodworker whose puppet becomes a live boy sound familiar? Do you remember the name of the puppet from that story? If you answered Pinocchio, you are correct.
Many kids are unaware that the original Pinocchio story was not written in America. Pinocchio's roots can be traced back to Tuscany, an area of Italy. Carlo Collodi wrote the original story in Italy in 1881. Since then the book has been translated into more than 250 languages.
, or changed, many times since Collodi's original version. Now the puppet-turned-boy is about to embark on a new journey in the movie
. The plot of the movie has an interesting twist. Pinocchio is turned back from a boy into a puppet!
The movie appears on HBO Family in February and comes out on video and DVD in April. Playing the part of Pinocchio is 16-year-old Gabriel Thomson, who lives in England. Gabriel starred in the movie when he was 12 years old.
Gabriel described his experience as ""incredible."" During filming, he attended school for three hours each day and worked with different tutors.
Just as Pinocchio learns lessons about growing up, Gabriel learned some of his own lessons. ""I learned a lot about acting from Martin Landau, [the actor who plays Geppetto]. He taught me how to relax on the set.""

326,761,"Eleven-year-old Josh Cook from Ohio became hooked on pocket bike racing last year. Josh races his pocket bike, or mini motorcycle, on a private track. He also makes sure to wear protective gear and safety equipment, such as a helmet and heavy boots, whenever he rides.
Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble.
Police in cities from Los Angeles to Boston are concerned about the safety of kids riding the popular pocket bikes. At less than 2 feet tall, the mini motorcycles are low to the ground.
""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told
. ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a drivers viewpoint.""
The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets.
Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers
This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles dont inform buyers that they cant be ridden on public streets.
Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a drivers license.
Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years.
Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track.""
Do you think kids should be allowed to ride pocket bikes on public streets? Why or why not?

329,686,"The cheetah cubs born recently at the National Zoo will reach their top speed of 70 miles per hour when they are about a year old.
It was a big day at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. First the mother cheetah came out of her cage. Then came one, two, three, four, five cubs. The babiesborn this summerleaped and played around their mother. The cubs, then just 10 weeks old, weighed only 9 pounds and were about the size of house cats.
The litter was the second born at the zoo in seven monthsand in its 116-year history. Cheetahs are extinct in the wild except in Africa, where only between 8,000 and 10,000 remain.
""They're pretty quick,"" Lauren Afdahl, an animal keeper at the National Zoo, told
. ""Whenever they see something moving, they take off and run."" The cubs will reach their top speed of 70 miles per hour when they are about a year old. That is as fast as a car speeding on the highway.
The cubs will stay with their mother for at least a year. When they are fully grown and weigh about 100 pounds, they may be sent to other zoos.

330,487,"It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements.
Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly:
You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this:
Why don't you talk to someone at school about it?
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now?
This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it.
Then you could add a statement or two, like this:
Bullying is more common than many people think.
The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone.
If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this:
Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.

331,547,"Probability is often based on surveys, because you get a more accurate measure of probability by basing your calculation on a large number of results.
Alex is doing some reporting for his local paper. The subject of his article is 'holidays'.
As part of his report he decides to question 10 of his friends whether they prefer caravanning or camping holidays. Seven out of 10 say that they prefer caravanning, so Alex writes the dramatic headline you see above.
Alex has based his probability on a very small survey. This is equivalent to throwing a die 10 times, throwing a 6 nine times by chance, and stating that the probability of obtaining a 6 is
! To estimate probabilities from the results of surveys, you must gather a large number of results.

332,421,"Questioning is an important skill that shows your teacher that you are listening carefully. There are two main types of questions.
These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female?
These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher?
You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question:
""What exactly do you mean by that?""
Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant:
""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?""
For their Speaking and Listening assessment, Matt has been paired with Tim. Matt has to interview Tim about his favourite character in the play, Romeo and Juliet. Tim is really shy and hates speaking. To get good marks himself, Matt knows that he has to encourage Tim to speak too.
Can you spot the listening skills that Matt uses to help Tim?
Why do you like him better than say, one of the main characters, like Romeo?
He's not so much of a show off.
Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo?
Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth.
Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies?
(Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose. I just meant that I like Benvolio because he's the only one that just tries to get by without getting into trouble.
Matt has good listening skills - when Tim gives a one word answer, Matt prompts him by asking further questions and he engages with Tim.
Talk your way out of trouble using your English skills.

Romeo and Juliet second key extract - What happens
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through.
Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home.
The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love.
""He jests at scars that never felt a wound""
He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun
Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet.: 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'.
and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day.
Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet.
He idolises her and compares her to an angel.
When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight?
Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much.
If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague.
When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it?
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other word would smell as sweet
When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin.
""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself""
When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party.
Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls.
Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery.
He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet.
Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer.
Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys.
Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it?
Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish.
Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love.
She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month).
She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly.
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.
She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it.
""My bounty is as boundless as the sea.
My love as deep. The more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite""
Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion!
Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream.
Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet.
Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married!
Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die.
She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside.
Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her.
Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?

337,191,"Persuasive texts try to persuade you to do something - like buy something or give money to charity. Magazine articles and newspaper reports may try to persuade you to agree with them.
Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself?
Here's how to spot this type of text:
It tries to convince you to do or agree with something.
It contains a mix of fact and opinion.
It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language.
It often seems to speak directly to the reader.
Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.
Here's an extract from an argument text:
Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban.
Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled.
Here are some clues to help you identify an argument text:
It discusses an issue, considering all points of view.
It often uses a formal and impersonal style to seem balanced.
It uses connectives to connect points, for example ""however"", ""but"", ""similarly""

338,284,"> More on equations - Equations with x on both sides
More on equations - Equations with x on both sides
The same rules apply if an equation has x on both sides. Keep the equation balanced and perform the same operation to both sides.
Solve the equation 2x + 2 = x + 4
The equation 2x + 2 = x + 4 is represented by the following diagram:
As usual, the bags represent the unknown (x) and the sweets represent the numbers. Aim to get unknowns on just one side of the equation, so begin by subtracting x from each side:
Now you have the type of equation that you recognise, all you need to do is subtract 2 from both sides.
2x + 2 = x + 4
Subtract x from both sides to give x + 2 = 4
Subtract 2 from both sides to give x = 2

339,97,"> Drama - Showing moods and emotions
Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience.
Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger.
What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them?
Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth.
Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march.
Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists.
Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing.
Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence!
Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion.
Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.
Don't be such a drama queen! Try this activity.

340,262,"When using trial and improvement guess what the answer might be, then improve on it until you get close to the correct answer.
A square has an area of 20 cm
. Use a method of trial and improvement to find the length of its side, correct to 1 decimal place (1 d.p.).
4 is too small, so try 5:
4 is too small, and 5 is too big, so the answer lies between 4 and 5.
between 4.4 and 4.5, but it is closer to 4.5
The question asked us to find the length of the side correct to 1 d.p., so you only need to try values with 1 d.p.
If, however, the question had asked for values correct to 2 d.p. you would have got a more accurate answer. For example:

341,149,"Antibiotics are medicines used by doctors when harmful microbes have made you ill. They are substances that harm bacteria. Some antibiotics stop the bacteria reproducing and others kill the bacteria directly.
Antibiotics are helpful to treat diseases caused by bacteria, such as tuberculosis and food poisoning. They do not harm viruses, so antibiotics cannot treat diseases such as colds and flu, which are caused by viruses.
Antibiotics only work against bacteria, not viruses
When you are infected by a microbe, it takes time for your body to start fighting the infection. It does this by making enough white blood cells with the correct antibody. During this time, you continue to feel unwell.
You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood.
infection by the same microbe, your body makes the correct antibodies much faster, because of the white blood cells that remain from when you had the first infection. The microbe doesn't get a chance to make you ill this time, and we say that you are

Immunisation is a process that doctors use to make people immune from certain illnesses, even before they have been infected. It involves you receiving an injection containing a
Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill.
You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella.
Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.

Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is.
The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way.
Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline.
Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part.
Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.

Remember that an element is one type of atom, like carbon, gold or chlorine. We will look at three ways that atoms can exist.
The atoms of some elements do not join up with other atoms. They stay as
The element helium is like this. Helium is an unreactive gas. Helium atoms do not join up with each other or any other element.
element join together we get a molecule of that element.
Oxygen is like this. Two oxygen atoms join together to make an oxyen molecule. Most of the oxygen in the air is in this form. Hydrogen and chlorine also have molecules with two atoms.
Some elements have molecules with more than two atoms. Sulfur atoms can make molecules of eight atoms joined together.
A compound is made when atoms of
This means that compounds will always exist as molecules, not separate atoms. The diagrams show some molecules of common compounds.

forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move.
friction between our shoes and the floor stop us from slipping
friction between tyres and the road stop cars from skidding
friction between the brakes and wheel help bikes and cars slow down
Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice.
Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal.
When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as

as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance.
Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to
the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily.
Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.

When chemicals, like the smell of perfume or burning toast, are let loose in a room, the particles mix with the air particles. The particles of smelly gas are free to move quickly in all directions. They eventually spread through the whole room. This is called
You don't have to mix the gases by waving your arms around - it mixes on its own. Diffusion in gases is quick because the particles in a gas move quickly. It happens even faster in hot gases
Diffusion can also happen in liquids. This is because the particles in liquids can move around each other, which means that eventually they are evenly mixed.
For example if you drop a little bit of paint into a jar of water the colour will spread slowly through the water. This is by diffusion.
Diffusion in liquids is slower than diffusion in gases because the particles in a liquid move more slowly.
happen at all in solids because the particles in a solid can only vibrate on the spot, rather than being able to move from place to place.
Under pressure? See what happens when you cool down.

351,101,"Try out these example questions about relative frequency.
Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'?
Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters.
A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 =
A2. The relative frequency of white counters is 0.3, and there are 20 counters in the bag, so, as an estimate, 0.3  20 =
Relative frequency can only be used as an estimate.

353,16,"Pythagoras' Theorem states that for all right-angled triangles,
'The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides'
. (The hypotenuse is the longest side and it's always opposite the right angle)
the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
and angle A is a right angle.
Pythagoras' Theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle.
Which of the following triangles is right-angled?

> Changes in the environment - Extinction
A species becomes extinct when there are no more individuals of that species left. An extinct species has gone forever.
Here are some of the things that can cause a species to become extinct:
a change in the physical environment, such as a change in the long-term temperature or rainfall patterns
competition from another species that is better adapted, including competition from humans
For example, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago. This was probably due to changes in the environment. But many species have become extinct more recently because of competition from humans.
The dodo was a flightless bird found on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the seventeenth century because of human activities. Humans disturbed the dodo's habitat and also brought new predators to the island, like pigs and dogs.

356,499,"> Drama - Drama from your imagination
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character.
This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't!
As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched.
The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react?
Here are two ideas for a character:
You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared?
You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles?
When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene.
Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more?
You're about to appear on the most popular morning TV programme and expose your discovery when you suddenly receive a startling phone call. Who is on the phone? What do they say? How do they make you feel?
You've landed a part in a popular soap but you don't get on with the other actors. Should you tell the press the truth or pretend that you all get along?
You've been working late in the library just double checking a few facts for your article when you notice a menacing looking man watching you. Does your character panic or keep calm? Do they run or confront the man? Maybe they are being paranoid?
The press have published some false rumours about you and you're really upset. Your agent has secured a slot on a popular chat show to give your side of the story. Do you accept the offer or decide to lie low? How do you feel?
Your article has been published and has been a massive hit. You're receiving job offers from high profile newspapers and magazines and your life is about to change for the better. How do your family react? What do you decide to do?
You've found out that one of the other band members is planning to leave the group and go solo. You confront them - can you persuade them to stay, or would it be better for everyone if they left?
When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas.
You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.

The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments.
However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians.
Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now.
Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent.
This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings.
In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time.
The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

358,22,"> The Tempest Summary - Prospero revealed
Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave.
He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him.
He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him.
Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over.
When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword.
The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place.
Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.

Diet, drugs and health - Absorption and egestion
These are the processes that happen in the digestive system:
We've already looked at how foods are broken down by enzymes in digestion. Now we will look at how the products of digestion are absorbed into the body.

. Once in the bloodstream, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed.
Only small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. Study the slideshow to check your understanding of this.
The inside wall of the small intestine needs to be
. This allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. If the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed.
To get a big surface area, the inside wall of the small intestine is lined with tiny
). These stick out and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules.
Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the
, the lower part of the large intestine, until we are ready to go to the toilet. It then comes out of the rectum through the

Quadratic sequences - Finding the nth term
Look again at the sequence of square numbers:
Whenever a sequence has a second difference of 2, it will be connected to the sequence of square numbers and the n
term will have something to do with n
term of the sequence 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ... ?
The second difference is 2, so the n
term has something to do with n
The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Our sequence is: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ...
Each term is 2 bigger than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the n

Preparing, planning and checking - Sample questions
Use the TAP technique for the question below. It will help if you read the question through several times and slowly to digest the content.
The following article has appeared in your local paper:
Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species.
Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved.
Have a think - what is the TAP? When you have your answer, check it with ours by pressing the 'Check ideas' button.
- it's to argue and persuade. This means you want to influence other people and tell them what you think is right
There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them.
Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours.
If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours.
Some people like spider diagrams. These are more complicated, but they can show how points are linked, like this:
Use whichever way you find best, but don't forget that planning is something you can practise. You'll get quicker and make more detailed plans if you keep trying.
Why must you prepare and plan? Find out here.

365,185,"To multiply 237 by 4 without using a calculator, you can set it out like this:
Start with 4  7, which is 28, so write the 8 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
4  3 = 12, but remember to add the carried 2 to get 14. Write the 4 and carry the 1 to the hundreds column.
4  2 = 8, and we add the carried 1 to get 9.

Diet, drugs and health - Digestion and enzymes
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful.
Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:
. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars.
The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.
. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by
, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food.
Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the
, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on.
are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.
, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.

Romeo and Juliet Summary - Marriage & murder
Meanwhile, Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has sent a letter to Montague's house challenging Romeo to a duel. Mercutio jokes about how good a swordsman Tybalt is, comparing him to a dancer. He calls him Prince of Cats. When Romeo turns up, Mercutio makes lots of rude jokes, and Romeo, who is now in a good mood joins in.
The Nurse warns Romeo not to mess Juliet around. He tells her that the wedding will be that afternoon at Friar Lawrence's place. The Nurse is really excited.
When the Nurse arrives back at the Capulet's house, Juliet is beside herself with impatience. The Nurse teases her and makes her wait for the good news.
Juliet meets Romeo at Friar Lawrence's and they go off to get secretly married.
Meanwhile, Mercutio squabbles with Benvolio. Benvolio is worried that the Capulets might turn up looking for a fight. Tybalt appears looking for Romeo. Mercutio teases him. Romeo arrives and refuses to fight Tybalt. Romeo tells him he loves him! (It's because Tybalt is now his relation through marriage, but he can't tell anyone that because the wedding is still a secret!) Mercutio fights Tybalt in Romeo's place. Romeo gets between them and, as a result, Mercutio is fatally wounded. He dies cursing both families. Romeo's grief at his friend's death quickly turns to rage. He kills Tybalt. Remembering Prince Escalus's warnings, Benvolio begs Romeo to run away.
Lady Capulet wants Romeo to be put to death for murdering Tybalt, but Prince Escalus points out that Tybalt killed Mercutio. He orders that Romeo should be sent away from Verona and not allowed back.

As the height of bar represents frequency, label the vertical axis 'Frequency'. The labelling of the horizontal axis depends on what is being represented by the bar chart.
Leon conducts a survey to find the number of people in each of the cars arriving at his school gate between 8.30am and 9.00am. His results are shown in the bar chart below:
a) How many cars contained 1 person?
b) How many cars contained more than 3 people?
c) Why there are only a small number of cars containing 1 person?
cars contained more than 3 people (10 + 4 = 14)
c) Most cars would be driven by parents bringing their children to school, only a few would contain just a teacher or a sixth former.

379,525,"> Electric current and voltage - Circuit symbols
Electric current and voltage - Circuit symbols
We use circuit symbols to draw diagrams of electrical circuits, with straight lines to show the wires. The diagram shows some common circuit symbols.
Notice the difference between the symbol for a
? The battery is made from joining cell symbols together.
Think of what we usually call a single battery, like the type you put in a torch. In physics, each of these is actually called a
- it is only when you have two or more of these cells connected together that you call it a battery.
The idea of a circuit diagram is to use circuit symbols instead of drawing each component in the circuit. Always try to make the wires
lines, and don't be tempted to make them wiggly.
The whole point is to make it easier to see what is connected to what. Here you can see how the symbols for a cell (not a battery!) and a lamp look in a circuit diagram.
If you have to draw a circuit diagram from scratch, it is usually easier to draw the circuit symbols first, and then add all the wires. If you have to draw wires to join circuit symbols that are already shown, use a ruler and don't let the wires cross each other.

381,224,"A food chain shows the different organisms that live in a habitat, and what eats what.
A food chain always starts with a producer, which is an organism that makes food. This is usually a green plant, because plants can make their own food by photosynthesis.
A food chain ends with a consumer, which is an animal that eats a plant or another animal. Here is an example of a simple food chain:
Take care - the arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating. If you get the arrows the wrong way round, instead of showing that humans eat cows, you are showing that cows eat humans, and that grass eats cows.
There are several words used to describe the organisms in a food chain. Study this food chain:
The plant is the producer and the animals are consumers.
Notice that the first consumer in the chain is also called the primary consumer, the next one is the secondary consumer and the one after that is the tertiary consumer.
A consumer that eats plants is called a
, and a consumer that eats other animals is called a
is an animal that eats both plants and animals.
A predator is an animal that eats other animals, and the prey is the animal that gets eaten by the predator. In the food chain above:
the frog is a predator and the grasshopper is its prey.
the hawk is a predator and the frog is its prey.

382,136,"> Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
Fractions - Common factors and simplest form
of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly.
Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them.
So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them.
4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 4).
2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so
(divide the top and the bottom by 2).
However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so
cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its

383,624," r  r. Only the 'r' is squared.
Find the area of the following (use
a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14  6  6 = 113.04cm
b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14  5  5 = 78.5cm
A dartboard has a radius of 20cm. The bullseye in the centre of the board has a radius of 1cm.
By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use
The area of the materials required is 10990mm
Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14  20  20 = 1256cm
The area of the small circle is 3.14  1  1 = 3.14cm
Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm
When calculating the area of a circle, remember to use the radius, not the diameter.

386,174,"To divide a large number by a 1-digit number you can set it out like this:
7 goes into 9 once with 2 remaining (remainder 2), so put a 1 above the 9 and carry the 2 to the tens column.
7 goes into 26 three times, remainder 5, so put 3 over the 6 and carry 5 to the hundreds column.
7 goes into 54 seven times, remainder 5 so put 7 over the 4 and have a remainder of 5.
So 964  7 = 137 remainder 5
We write this with an 'r' for 'remainder', so it looks like this:
964  7 = 137 r 5

387,31,"> Inequalities and Simultaneous Equations - Algebra
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other.
Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears:
3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1
6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct)
To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5
6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct)
So the solution is x = 2, y = 1

Analyse, review and comment - The differences
, you need to remain objective, detached, balanced, fair and avoid just giving your own opinions in your conclusion. An analysis:
Offers a balanced examination of an issue or text
Investigates an issue or text's key points
Unlike a review, it's not solely focused on pros and cons or good and bad
is more subjective and personal. Personal knowledge and authority will make your conclusions count. However, you will still need to support your points with valid reasons. A review
Draws a conclusion, saying whether something works for its audience and purpose
gives purely subjective and personal views on a topic. If you're asked to give one in class, you should still be authoritative providing support for your views. A comment:
Uses the first person narrator  I think, In my opinion, I really like this
Although other comments may not, you should support your ideas with evidence when you comment in class.
Make all that writing make sense. Try this!

Extract 1 - Act 1, Scene 1, lines 98 to 232
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began?
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them. In the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
Peered forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad 
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
I neither know it, nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
Is to himself  I will not say how true 
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
See where he comes. So please you, step aside.
Ill know his grievance or be much denied.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, lets away.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeos hours?
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still,
Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Heres much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it pressed
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs:
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers eyes;
Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here.
This is not Romeo: hes some other where.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aimed so near when I supposed you loved.
A right good mark-man! And shes fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss. Shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow. She hath Dians wit,
And in strong proof of chastity well-armed,
From Loves weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
O, she is rich in beauty  only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
To call hers  exquisite  in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair:
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who passed that passing fair?
Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
Ill pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

402,482,"A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job.
Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence.
First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense.
Each of these words does a different job.
is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence.
is a noun - it names things in a sentence.
is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun.
We put words together to make a
A phrase is a short, single piece of information:
We use phrases to make a clause.
A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb.
In this clause, the noun phrase is
This now takes us to the sentence.
If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence.
. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea.
A complex sentence is used to put across more
ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it.
The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself.
The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause.
We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence.
We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence.

When quoting from a text, remember to:
Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...
when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means
Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent).
Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones.
Remember that certain words and phrases are helpful when you're explaining an idea in some detail, especially if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following list shows some of those phrases.
Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:

Explore, imagine and entertain - Ending short-stories
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as:
, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes.
, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes.
, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful.
However, there are two endings to avoid:
, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned.
, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story.
Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan.
Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.

405,141,"> Measures - Speed, distance and time
Speed is worked out by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken:
If you travel at 70 km in 2 hours. What is your average speed?
Speed = 70  2 = 35 km/h
The distance in km and the time in h, so the units for speed are km/h.
If you know the speed, you can work out the time or the distance by re-arranging the equation.
hours at an average speed of 4 miles/h. How far will you have walked?
Distance = 4  1.5 = 6 miles

Astronomy and space science - The Moon
The Moon orbits the Earth, so it is called a
. No-one built it or launched it into space.
Gravitational forces between the Moon and the Earth keep the Moon in orbit. The Moon does not produce light. But it does
light from the Sun, which is how we are able to see it from Earth. (Only stars produce light and they are called luminous for that reason.)
It takes the Moon 28 days to make a complete orbit of the Earth. As it orbits, we see the Moon lit from different angles. This is why we see
Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. That is called a 'full Moon'. At other times we see a crescent shaped Moon, because we can only see the edge of the part that is lit by the Sun.
Remember that we can only see the part of the Moon that reflects the Sun's light. How much of that we can see depends upon the position of the Moon in its orbit.
This slideshow shows the phases of the Moon, as seen from the Earth.
A common mistake is to think that the phases of the Moon happen because the Earth gets in the way, and casts its shadow onto the Moon. That is not how the phases are caused.
However sometimes it does happen that the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. Then we get an
of the Moon. The whole Moon goes from full, to dark, and back again to full, in the course of a few hours.

If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4).
If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4).
If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8).
If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40).
Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio.
Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form.
To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28.
2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14.
You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is
No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio.

413,319,"Something that is implicit is inferred - it is suggested, but not actually said. Implicit meaning can be a little harder to find than explicit meaning. Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life.
The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following:
Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues.
A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk.
He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside,
he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat
. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst.
He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.
""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said.
Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk.
,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had
a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm
, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week.""
On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to
about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors.
Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully?
When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a
man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort.
We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful.
So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!

415,126,"> Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
Introduction to equations - Balancing the equation
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side.
For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here.
By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced.
You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is:
Subtract 3 from both sides, to give:
In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets:
To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half:
Divide both sides by 2, to give:
a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7
b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7
When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers.
For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7.

Polygons - The exterior angle of a polygon
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge.
The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360.
Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360.
In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.

421,79,"The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford:
a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge?
b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford?
c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge?
d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take?
a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835.
b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844.
d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.

426,210,"> Food chains - Pyramids of numbers
The population of each organism in a food chain can be shown in a sort of bar chart called a pyramid of numbers. The more organisms there are, the wider the bar. The producer in the food chain always goes at the bottom of the pyramid of numbers.
Clover is a plant and it is the producer in this food chain. Its bar goes at the bottom of the pyramid:
Energy is lost to the surroundings as we go from one level to the next, so there are fewer organisms at each level in this food chain. A lot of clover is needed to support the snail population. A thrush eats lots of snails, and a hawk eats lots of thrushes, so the population of hawks is very small.
Sometimes the pyramid of numbers doesn't look like a pyramid at all. This could happen if the producer is a large plant such as a tree, or if one of the animals is very small. Remember, though, that whatever the situation, the producer still goes at the bottom of the pyramid.
An oak tree is very large so many insects can feed on it
Fleas are very small and lots of them can feed on a rabbit

The Tempest second key extract - Characters
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer.
Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts?
In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband.
Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her.
She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero.
In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage.
Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character.
Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.

Fractions - Mixed numbers and improper fractions
A whole number can be written as
, because it is made up of a whole number and a fraction.
, because the top number is bigger than the bottom number.
Converting from a mixed number to an improper fraction
You can write the whole number part as a fraction, then add the fractions together.
Converting from improper fractions to mixed numbers
You can separate out the fraction into smaller fractions, like this:
Another way to convert an improper fraction is to find how many whole numbers you get, by using a division.
We start by dividing the top number by the bottom number.
17 divided by 5 is 3 remainder 2.
So the whole number part is 3, and the remainder 2 means there are
= 20  7 = 2 remainder 6, so
If your calculator has a fraction button you can use this to convert from improper fractions to mixed numbers. Type in the improper fraction, press '=', and the calculator will convert it to a mixed number.

Compounds and mixtures - Metal and non-metals oxides
Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide.
Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulfur.
Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide:
Sulfur burns in air to form sulfur dioxide:
Non-metal oxides such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for
. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife.

431,256,"> Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
Decimals - Place value and ordering decimals
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc).
0.1 is a tenth, 1/10 of a unit
0.01 is a hundredth, 1/100 of a unit
0.001 is a thousandth. 1/1000 of a unit
In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100.
When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first.
Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32?
Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301.
Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301).
Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4?
Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19
A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100.
A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2?
All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest.
You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.

Acids, bases and metals - Reactions of acids with metals
Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get
This is the general word equation for the reaction:
The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples:
It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt.
There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.
All acids contain hydrogen atoms. Apart from hydrochloric acid, this is not clear from their names, but you can tell they contain hydrogen from their chemical formulae. Remember that the chemical symbol for hydrogen is H.

436,164,"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story?
a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat.
b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor.
There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more.
So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on.
a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed.
b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park?
a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete.
b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park.
It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start.
The importance of beginnings, middles and ends.

The Tempest second key extract - Issues and ideas
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are:
If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points:
In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play.
Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude.
It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh.
Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio.
As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island.
Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand.
Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan.
Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.

438,326,"> More on equations - Equations when x is negative
More on equations - Equations when x is negative
If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation.
5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12
Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14
And finally, divide by 7 to give
As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x
(5  2) - 2 = 12 - (2  2)
10 - 2 = 12 - 4
This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct.
Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10.
To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2
Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5
Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give
Then subtract 1 from each side to give
Divide each side by 2 to give

439,290,"> Character - First, second and third person accounts
Character - First, second and third person accounts
A text can be written in the first, second or third person. This is all about who is telling the story. Here is a quick summary:
means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this.
means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing.
means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others.

When you're dealing with directions you need to think about both parts of the instruction. What is it telling you to do?
And in which direction or where is it telling you to go?
Often there will be direction expressions in the question that you can recycle. If you're not sure which one to choose, take away the expressions you do know and see what you've got left.
When writing your own directions, don't try to translate word for word from English. Look at the expressions used in the question and try to keep to that form.

443,1835,"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to
microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses
, and therefore its ability to stay fresh.
Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0C to 3C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely.
Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant.
Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18C and -29C. Home freezers store products at -18C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them
A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.
Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly.
In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0C to 4C.
UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132C to 140C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled.

446,1209,"We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (tenths, hundredths, thousandths etc)
In the number 34.27, the value of the figure 2 is a tenth, and the value of the figure 7 is a hundredth.
When ordering numbers, we should always compare the digits on the left first.
For example, which is greater: 2.701 or 2.71?
Both numbers have two units and seven tenths, but 2.701 has no hundredths, whereas 2.71 has one hundredth. Therefore, 2.71 is greater than 2.701.
Another way to look at it is to write a zero at the end of 2.71 to make it 2.710 (this does not change its value, because it is after the decimal point).
The two numbers are now 2.710 and 2.701. It is quite easy to see that 2.710 is bigger (just as 2710 is bigger than 2701).

450,6710,"The elements in group 7 are called the halogens. They belong to the column second from right in the periodic table. The halogens are all toxic, but this is a useful property. Chlorine is used to sterilise drinking water and water in swimming pools. Iodine is used in antiseptics to treat wounds.
The halogens have the following properties in common:
they have low melting and boiling points
they are poor conductors of heat and electricity

451,5491,"A reflex response to a new stimulus can be
trained dogs to expect food whenever he rang a bell. The dogs eventually produced saliva when they heard the bell ring.
The dog salivates naturally when given food.
Pavlov rings a bell every time the dog eats.
After much repetition the dog salivates when the bell rings, even when there is no food.
. The dogs were conditioned to salivate when the bell rang.
A ringing bell does not normally cause salivation in dogs. However, when the ringing bell becomes a secondary stimulus, it does cause salivation, even though the dog will not be able to eat the bell as food.
This is now called a conditioned reflex. In a conditioned reflex the final response (salivation) has no direct connection with the stimulus (ringing bell).
Predators mistake the hoverfly for a wasp due to similar markings
For example, birds will not eat caterpillars with bright colouring because they are conditioned to think of bright colours as poisonous. Some caterpillars use this to their advantage. Their bright colours protect them, even though they are not poisonous.
How often have you run away from a harmless hoverfly because it has the same markings as a wasp?
a reflex response. It does this by sending an impulse along a motor neuron of the reflex arc. This enables us, for example, to hold onto a hot dinner plate when normally we would drop it.
Put down that pen and listen to some additional Science audio.

452,5867,"Using life cycle assessments (Ideas about science)
The use of a life cycle assessment, or LCA, may involve studying social and economic circumstances, sustainability, regulations and laws. These can help you to make an informed decision about the use of a material or product.
When using a life cycle assessment to make decisions about the use of a material or product, it is important to:
know that some questions can be addressed using a scientific approach, and some cannot
be able to identify the groups of people who may be affected, and the main benefits and costs of a course of action for each group
be able to explain whether the use of the material is sustainable
recognise that there are regulations and laws that control scientific research and applications
Read on if you are taking the
Feasibility and course of action - higher only
When using a life cycle assessment to make decisions about the use of a material or product, it is important to be able to:

454,2114,"Back at school, Scout learns about Hitler's treatment of the Jews and is amazed that no one in Maycomb seems able to connect that to the racism in the town.
Mr Ewell tries to break into Judge Taylor's house and menaces Tom Robinson's widow.
They are both attacked on Halloween night
Jem and Scout attend a Halloween pageant at school - its subject is the history of Maycomb county and Scout is dressed as a shoulder of ham. She misses her entry on stage and so decides to keep her costume on to walk home in, to hide her embarrassment. It is a dark night and Jem soon realises they are being followed. They are both attacked - Scout is squashed inside her costume and Jem breaks his arm. Someone carries Jem home.
The attacker was Mr Ewell: he is found dead, with a kitchen knife in his ribs.

As you learn it, keep breaking it down into separate headings or pictures until you have gone from a page of A4 to a small piece of paper with a maximum of 5 headings.
If you are talking about different subjects, draw them and try talking around the pictures. The more picture associations you can find, the easier your presentation will be to remember on the day.
Practise your talk with another person, or record it on to a minidisc or cassette, or onto your computer, and play it back. If you haven't been through the whole thing a few times, you won't know if you can remember all the points you want to make.

460,2464,"Your school plays a big part in shaping your attitudes towards sport. There are many roles you could try in addition to playing the sport, like coaching younger teams to see if teaching may be a hidden talent! Earning a qualification by taking courses and awards may help guide you towards longer-term job prospects.
Outside influences and social groupings may mean you take up a certain sport or avoid it altogether. One things certain, weve got more leisure time than ever, so why not do something physical with it?
Your school can influence you to become a lifelong participant in sport as a player, organiser or official. Schools have to teach PE within the National Curriculum. Within this you will experience a number of
. Each has benefits to you and others.
Improve your knowledge of the rules. Can still contribute when unable to play.
Allows teachers to teach rather than umpire/referee
Develop organisational skills, stay involved in sport if not able to participate
Enable sport to happen and arrange competitions etc
Outlet for creativity, develop ideas beyond your own ability
Provide exciting and challenging context for dancers
When thinking about the other ways in which school can influence the
of sports in which pupils participate, consider the ways in which each of the following has an impact:
- how do GCSE, JSLA etc help? Can these courses lead to a career in sport?
- does your school have a swimming pool, Astroturf pitch, sports hall or tennis courts?
- what sports activity does your school have outside of PE lessons?
- are they positive? Do they have favourite sports? What if your favourite isnt the same as theirs?
- are you introduced to clubs in the area?
Your school's links with local clubs can affect your participation
Role models such as David Beckham, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Kelly Holmes have had a huge influence on participation in recent years.
Women are now accepted as managers, officials and club directors although this was not always the case.
Some sports, such as squash, have declined in popularity whilst womens football and extreme sports are booming. Media coverage of sport affects participation levels. So does the rising concern about safety which has stopped a lot of 'free play' on the streets and in parks.
A number of organisations have responsibility for sport and these both

are the groups to which you are 'attached' because of your circumstances. Social groupings can have either a positive or negative influence on your involvement in sport.
If they enjoy and play sport, you will join in.
If they do not share your interest, they can encourage you to give up sport.
An interest in specific sports will encourage participation. Inherited ability may help you to be successful. They provide good role models.
They may influence you to move away from a sport you like and towards their favourite sport. If they do not like sport, it may be hard for you to get support.
Boys often find it easier to access sport. Women are now active in developing women-only gyms and teams. This encourages participation.
Some people may expect you to conform to
An assumption based only on a general expectation.
behaviour. Opportunities for women are increasing, but support is still limited in some areas. Some religions do not encourage women to participate.
Some ethnic groups have a particular interest in certain sports. This cultural influence encourages participation.
Racist attitudes still make participation uncomfortable for some sportspeople, so they may quit.
All sports are available if you can afford them.
Sports needing lots of equipment, travel or expensive facilities are not available to those with little money.
Peer pressure can encourage or discourage participation. Photo courtesy of BBC Sport
The pressure to conform to the actions of people of the same age and background.
is very strong during the teenage years. This can encourage participation, or make it difficult to do your own thing.
Leisure time is the time we have when we are not working, taking care of ourselves or completing our family and home duties.
It has increased as a result of:
Better working conditions - paid holidays have increased
We can choose what we do in our leisure time. Local authorities and the leisure industry try to influence us to take part in physical activity and sport. Local authorities have targeted certain user groups by offering them
A reduction in the usual price of a ticket granted to a special group of customers, eg students
, such as special opening times, reduced fees and organised classes- to encourage participation.
Facilities are provided for participants of all ages and levels of ability including:
Crystal Palace, Bisham Abbey, Lilleshall, Holme Pierrepoint, Plas-y-Brenin
also provide stadiums, playing areas and leisure clubs.
Golf courses can be run by the council or privately owned
The provision of facilities is always based upon:
Location  is it in the right place? Can permission for it be obtained?
Scope  does the location and the size of the site enable the provision required? Can it be accessed easily?
Funding  can the funds be found to build it? Can they be sustained to keep it running?
Hosting a major event leaves locals with improved facilities
Hosting sports events can be very expensive but many cities and countries compete to be awarded the football World Cup, the Commonwealth Games, the Olympics and a number of other competitions.
There are pros and cons to this:
Advantages of hosting a major sporting event
Disadvantages of hosting a major sporting event
Improved infrastructure - roads, rail links, accommodation (housing)
Huge financial gamble - it may make a huge loss

462,5218,"The amount of energy transferred from the burning fuel to the water in the calorimeter can be calculated if you know:
energy transferred (joules, J) = mass of water heated (grams, g)  4.2  temperature rise (C)
For a given amount of water heated up, the greater the temperature rise, the greater the amount of heat energy transferred to the water. For example, twice as much energy is transferred to the water to achieve a temperature increase of 20C compared with 10C.
You can compare fuels by measuring the mass of fuel burned in the experiment. The best fuel is likely to release the most energy per gram of fuel. This is worked out using:

Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.

466,5815,"W B Yeats: Song of the Old Mother
Yeats wrote a great deal about the passage of time, and of youth and beauty giving way to old age and death.
A central, unifying idea that runs through a text or performance.
. The poem contrasts two types of human endeavour: the young women's dreams of love and obsession with appearance; and the hard, grinding, thankless work that is the Old Mother's lot.
An interesting cross-current is set going by our uncertainty about who the young women are.
Are they the Old Mother's own children? If so, their idleness is easier to forgive. Perhaps in her youth the old woman herself dreamed of love, lay late in bed, and obsessed about whether her ribbons matched. Perhaps, as old people often do, she has forgotten what it's like to be young!
Or are they the children of the old woman's rich employers? If they are, we are more likely to view them as spoilt and selfish young people whose idle lives are made possible only by the drudgery of poor servants like the Old Mother.
And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
While I must work because I am old,
And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.'

to compare the development of one region against another. For example:
Do the population have access to medical care? What level of healthcare is available - basic or advanced? Is it free?
A Less Economically Developed Country [LEDC] has low levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the southern hemisphere (eg countries in southern Africa, southern Asia and South America) are LEDCs, while more of the countries in the northern hemisphere are More Economically Developed Countries [MEDCs].
focus on primary industries, such as farming, fishing and mining.
A More Economically Developed Country [MEDC] has high levels of development, based on economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (the country's income). More of the countries in the northern hemisphere are MEDCs, eg UK, USA, Canada, Europe. More of the countries in the southern hemisphere are Less Economically Developed Countries [LEDCs].
focus on secondary industries, such as manufacturing. The most advanced countries tend to focus more on tertiary or service industries, such as banking and information technology.
Do the population have access to education? Is it free? What level of education is available (ie primary, secondary or further/higher education)?
MEDCs are countries which have a high
Standard of living of a person or a population is usually measured in economic terms, ie how much wealth they have. It also takes into account what there is to spend more on, ie the goods and services that are available for purchase. Life expectancy, literacy rate and other indicators may also be taken into account, when determining standard of living.
Gross Domestic Product [GDP] measures the wealth or income of a country. It is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year.
. LEDCs are countries with a low standard of living and a much lower GDP.
The map shows the locations of LEDCs and MEDCs. Most of the southern hemisphere is less developed, while countries in the northern hemisphere are more developed.

Music that has no chordal accompaniment, where different instruments or parts play or sing the same notes is described as in
Here is an example of unison: a male choir singing a traditional Armenian hymn.
This literally means 'sounding together'. Homophonic music is played in block chords. Sometimes, homophonic music is called chordal music, it means the same thing.
Here is an example of music with a homophonic texture, written by Henry VIII.
This literally means 'different sounds or voices'. Polyphonic music has parts that weave in and out of each other. Sometimes this is called contrapuntal music - it means the same thing.
Polyphonic music may contain an element of imitation, where one voice or instrument copies what has just been played by another. (Think of a roundsong like
Listen to this example of music that has a polyphonic texture, from JS Bach's
A fugue is a special type of polyphonic texture. Fugues always begin with a tune that is played on a solo instrument/voice or by instruments/voices in unison. This tune is then played by all the other instruments or voices in turn but not necessarily at the same pitch.
Here is an example of a fugue. Notice how the solo starts the fugue tune and then the other voices join in one at a time.
A capella music is always for voices. It describes vocal music that has no instrumental accompaniment.
A capella music can be polyphonic, homophonic or unison - so you might see a piece of music described as 'homophonic a capella' or 'polyphonic a capella'.
The words 'a capella' in Italian mean 'In the style of the chapel'. This is because early music for the church was for unaccompanied voices.
Listen to this example of a capella singing - yodelling from Gabon in Africa.
This is a melody which can be sung or played on an instrument, with an accompaniment. A song with piano accompaniment falls into this category.
Here is an example of melody and accompaniment:
This texture is when a solo is heard which is immediately answered by another tune played or sung by a group. It is used a lot in popular music, jazz music and music from other cultures.
Here is an example of a call-and-response song from Latin America
Listen to this extract of music by Mozart that only uses the words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' and comment on the textures voices and instruments you hear.
: The music starts with just one instrument and one voice. The other voices and instruments then join in one at a time. At the end, all the instruments and voices play their own tune starting at different times.
Talvin has obviously heard that the voices have tunes starting at different times, but has not gone into enough detail about it. He didn't mention any instruments or voices by name and couldn't mention any of the textures by name either.
: The music starts with just the trombones and the bass voice. This type of texture is called 'unison'. The alto voice then joins in making the texture weave in and out. The voices sing Kyrie Eleison. A high voice then comes in singing a tune to the words 'Christe Eleison' which adds to the weaving style. There are timpani and strings in this piece. At the end, all the voices are weaving in and out of each other.
This is a good answer by Sarah. She has named one texture, unison. She heard that the music was 'weaving' but didn't use the proper word 'polyphonic'. She has also correctly identified one voice and an instrument.
: The music begins with the trombones and bass voices in unison. The voices sing the words 'Kyrie Eleison'. The alto voices then join in with faster notes singing the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is now polyphonic. The Soprano voices then sing the 1st tune (that the basses sang at first) to the words 'Kyrie Eleison' while the tenor voices sing the tune that the altos sang earlier to the words 'Christe Eleison'. The texture is still polyphonic. Timpani are heard to add emphasis to the bass part. Towards the end, all the voices sing both tunes to both sets of words in a polyphonic texture. Overall, the music has two tunes. The style is a fugue, where the tunes overlap each other.
Geeta has used the proper words to describe the textures and the voices/instruments used in this excerpt. She spotted that each set of words 'Kyrie Eleison' and 'Christe Eleison' has its own tune. Finally, she correctly identified the piece of music as being a fugue.

 a typical wage for male workers was about 15 shillings (75p) a week, but women and children were paid much lower wages, with women earning 7 shillings (35p) and children 3 shillings (15p). For this reason,
employers preferred to employ women and children
. Many men were sacked when they reached adulthood and had to be supported by their wives and children.
 frequent strapping (it was claimed that children had been thrashed to death).
One witness claimed that he had seen an iron bar driven through the cheek of one girl. Other alleged punishments included hanging iron weights around childrens necks, hanging them from the roof in baskets, nailing a childs ear to the table, and dowsing them in water butts to keep them awake.
 fines were imposed for things like talking or whistling, leaving the room without permission, of having a little dirt on a machine. It was claimed that employers altered the time on the clocks to make their workers late so that they could fine them.
Some employers required their overseers to raise a minimum amount each week from fines.
 many children who were forced to stand for long hours grew up with conditions such as knock-knees and bow legs.
 forcing children to crawl into dangerous, unguarded machinery - often when they were so tired they were falling asleep on their feet - led to many accidents. It was said that 40 per cent of accident cases at Manchester Infirmary in 1833 were factory accidents.
 cotton thread had to be spun in damp conditions at 70F. Going straight out into the cold night air led to

 some employers paid their workers in tokens, which could only be spent at the employers shop, where prices were higher.

They release enzymes to break down compounds, so that they can absorb the nutrients. We can preserve our food, for example by freezing or canning, to remove the conditions needed for decay to occur.
Food chains, pyramids of numbers and pyramids of biomass are all ways of showing how energy is passed on from one organism to another.
Biomass is the food available for the next trophic level (feeding level) in a food chain. Biomass is used as a source of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
Intensive farming practices include growing high-yield crops, using fertilisers and pesticides and keeping animals indoors. Food production is increased but there are unwelcome side effects.
Organic farming bans chemical inputs and has a less harmful effect on the environment but often produces less, more expensive food.
Hydroponics is the production of food using nutrient-rich solution rather than soil.
Leaves enable photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process by which leaves absorb light and carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrate (food) for plants to grow. Leaves are adapted to perform their function eg they have a large surface area to absorb sunlight.
Plants use minerals from the soil to build the complex molecules they need to survive and grow. Poor plant growth may be due to a deficiency of one or more minerals. Tests can be done to establish which mineral is deficient or a general purpose NPK fertiliser added.
Plants have two different types of 'transport' tissue. Xylem transports water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves, which results in more water being drawn up from the roots.
The element carbon is the present in all living organisms. It's recycled through various processes, which are described in the carbon cycle.
Nitrogen is essential for the formation of amino acids to make proteins. The nitrogen cycle describes the ways in which nitrogen is recycled.
Osmosis is the movement of water from a high water concentration to a low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis takes place in all living cells.
Plants absorb water from the soil by osmosis through their root hair cells. Plants use water for several vital processes including photosynthesis and transporting minerals.
All substances are made from atoms. Each atom is made of a nucleus - containing protons and neutrons - surrounded by electrons.
The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom. The elements are arranged in the Periodic Table in ascending order of atomic number.
The mass number of an atom is the total of protons plus neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and hence different mass numbers) are called isotopes of that element.
A covalent bond is formed between non metal atoms, which combine together by sharing electrons. Covalent compounds have no free electrons and no ions so they don't conduct electricity.
The Periodic Table is an arrangement of the elements in order of atomic number. Elements in the same vertical column are in the same group or family and have similar chemical properties.
Electrolysis is the decomposition of a liquid using electricity. When ionic compounds are molten or dissolved in water the ions are free to move.
When sulfuric acid is electrolysed, hydrogen is produced at the cathode (negative electrode) and oxygen at the anode (positive electrode). Aluminium is extracted from the mineral bauxite using the process of electrolysis.
All matter is made of atoms. There are over a hundred different types of atom, called elements, and each one has a symbol. The atoms of a particular element are identical to each other.
When atoms of different elements join together they make a compound. Compounds are represented by formulae that show how many atoms of each element are in the compound. Formulae can be worked out from the charge of the ions that make up the compound.
Chemical reactions can be written down as balanced chemical equations.
The Group 1 elements in the Periodic Table are known as the alkali metals. They include lithium, sodium and potassium, which all react vigorously with air and water.
The reactivity of the alkali metals increases down the group. Flame tests are used to identify alkali metal ions in compounds.
The Group 7 elements are also known as the halogens. They include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, which all have seven electrons in their outer shell.
In a displacement reaction a less reactive element is
Ionic bonding occurs between positive and negative ions, which attract each other and bind together to form ionic compounds. For example, sodium chloride consists of Na
Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions held in place by electrostatic attraction and forming an ionic crystal lattice. The ions in a crystal lattice are very strongly bonded - a high temperature is required to melt the crystal.
The physical properties of different metals make them useful for different purposes. For example, aluminium conducts heat, which makes it a useful material for making saucepans and gold is shiny, which makes it an attractive material for jewellery.
Metal particles are held together by strong metallic bonds, which is why they have high melting and boiling points. The loose electrons in metals can all move together through the metal  creating an electric current.
The elements in the middle section of the Periodic Table are the transition elements. They're all metals with typical metallic properties eg conducting heat and electricity. They often form coloured compounds.
Transition metal carbonates undergo thermal decomposition - a reaction in which a substance is broken down into at least two other substances by heat.
Transition metal hydroxides are insoluble in water. They can be precipitated out of a transitional metal compound solution using sodium hydroxide solution.

Female homesteader, contemplating her life on the Plains
Early settlers and homesteader on the Plains faced huge problems. The burden of many of these fell on the women, whose lives were burdensome and unpleasant:
There was little wood to build log cabins.
Settlers built 'sod houses', while they lived out of doors - people did their cooking on an open fire.
Outdoor toilets and open wells. The sod houses leaked, and fleas and bedbugs lived in them 'by the million'. It was impossible to disinfect the floor. As a result the death rate, especially from diphtheria, was high.
A 'good thick coat of whitewash' killed bedbugs. 'A layer of clay' stopped leaks. Homesteaders eventually built more modern houses.
There was no wood for fuel, and no shops to buy items such as candles and soap. A typical household had only two buckets, some crockery and one cracked cup. There was no water and little food.
A travelling shoe-maker or tinker might pass through who would provide or mend household items, but usually families just had to make do. The women collected 'buffalo chips' for fuel, stoked the stove, and made their own candles and soap. 'I have often wondered how my mother stood it', wrote an early settler.
No doctors or midwives. No social life 'because of the distances between farmhouses'. In the winter families were shut in 'and longed for spring'.
People had to make the most of any trip to their nearest town, where the women talked of the harvest and the men smoked corncob pipes and talked politics.
Local government was non-existent, and some early lawmen (such as Henry Plummer) were worse than the bandits.
Law courts and sheriffs such as Wyatt Earp slowly established law and order.

Precipitation is the term given to moisture that falls from the air to the ground. In the UK, the most common form of precipitation is rain, but snow, hail, sleet, drizzle, fog, and mist are also precipitation.
Humidity is the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. Air can only hold a certain amount of water before condensation and precipitation occurs. Humidity is measured as a percentage, relative to the saturation point where the air can hold no more water vapour (ie 100 % humidity).
Atmospheric pressure is the weight of air resting on the Earth's surface. Pressure is shown on a weather map with lines called isobars. Low pressure occurs when air is warm and rises. High pressure occurs when air becomes colder and sinks.

The weather is constantly changing as temperature and humidity change in the atmosphere. Landmasses, such as the British Isles, experience constantly changing weather conditions.
is the average weather conditions - temperature, pressure, precipitation and humidity - expected for a certain place. Climate is based on the average weather experienced over 30 years or more.
Climate refers to what is expected to happen in the atmosphere rather than the actual conditions. It is possible for the weather to be different from that suggested by the climate.
Climatic conditions in an area can be affected by the landscape, relief and activities taking place (both human and natural). Climate can alter over time and space.
Within a climatic region, the climate may vary from place to place - eg the top of a hill, the sunny side of a hill, the shaded side of a hill and the bottom of a hill. These areas with their small variations are called

477,5139,"Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Beatrice change during the course of
?' There are all sorts of references you can make to language:
When we first meet Beatrice, she seems to be a clever, independent woman. She speaks openly, not waiting to be asked, and seems to like making fun of Benedick in particular. She compares him with ""a disease"", and her repartee makes even the messenger afraid of her. Throughout the play she uses puns, such as saying Claudio is ""civil as an orange"". This shows her witty nature, because she plays on the similarity between ""civil"" and ""Seville"": he is either polite or bitter (just like the oranges from Seville).
This combines much of what we have covered so far. It starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you do not have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead, show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used, and the effects they have on his audience.

a piece of hardware that connects a computer to the Internet
. The terminal adaptor removes the need to convert
data measured at discrete intervals, eg a digital watch typically moves from displaying one second to the next without displaying the values in-between
signals to analogue signals before theyre sent down the telephone line, this results in a more reliable
a computer's or another internet-enabled device's connection to the Internet
ine) provides connection speeds of up to 24
and uses a telephone line to receive and transmit
information without context, eg a list of students with numbers beside their names is data, when it's made clear that those numbers represent their placing in a 100 metre race, the data becomes information
The speed that data can be transferred is dependent on a number of factors:
Phone lines were designed to carry voice signals - not data. Signal quality can vary between lines and whilst it doesnt affect voice signals, it
The distance between your house and the
a system of electronic components that connects telephone calls and has been adapted and expanded to facilitate connections to the Internet too
has an effect on the speed at which data is transferred. A distance of 4Km is considered the limit for ADSL technology, beyond which it may not work.
a device for connecting computers and other network capable devices together to form a network
Internet access over ADSL. This is usually provided by your
Internet Service Provider - needed in order to access the Internet, they also provide services such as web space and email
Phone calls can still be made whilst connected.
Cable companies do not use traditional telephone lines to provide broadband Internet access. They have their own
, a combination of co-axial copper cable and
cable that carries data transmitted as light
With their purposefully built infrastructure cable companies are able to provide speeds of up to 50Mbps - considerably faster than the highest available ADSL speed (24Mbps).
modem/router is needed for broadband Internet access over cable. This is usually provided by your ISP.
The making and receiving of phone calls is not affected because the telephone line is not used.

480,865,"The three main causes of population change are:
- usually measured using the birth rate (number of live births per 1000 of the population).
- usually measured using the death rate (number of deaths per 1000 of the population) .
- the movement of people in and out of an area.
of population change. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country or place is called the
. The natural increase is calculated by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.
natural increase = birth rate - death rate
The rate of natural increase is given as a percentage, calculated by dividing the natural increase by 10.
For example if the birth rate is 14 per 1000 population, and the death rate is 8 per 1000 population, then the growth rate = 14 - 8 = 6

The effects of an earthquake can be devastating - they can destroy settlements, change landscapes, and cause many deaths.
is the shaking and vibration of the Earth's crust due to movement of the Earth's plates (plate tectonics). Earthquakes can happen along any type of plate boundary.
Earthquakes occur when tension is released from inside the crust. Plates do not always move smoothly alongside each other and sometimes get stuck. When this happens pressure builds up. When this pressure is eventually released, an earthquake tends to occur.
The point inside the crust where the pressure is released is called the focus. The point on the Earth's surface above the
Earthquake energy is released in seismic waves. These waves spread out from the focus. The waves are felt most strongly at the epicentre, becoming less strong as they travel further away. The most severe damage caused by an earthquake will happen close to the

485,3919,"The Romans are known to have had some knowledge of the internal workings of human bodies, particularly through the work of Galen. However, historians question whether they performed internal surgical operations.
Through their work with gladiators and wounded soldiers, Roman doctors became experts at
They could do a large number of simple external operations, such as removing polyps up the nose and goitres from the neck.
Ancient Roman doctor treating a patient's goitre
We know that the Romans developed new
(though they look barbaric to us nowadays). They also developed the Caesarean section to remove a baby from the womb (although it is not true that Julius Caesar was born this way). In those times the mother always died - Roman Caesarean sections were usually performed to save the baby of a woman who had died during childbirth.
We have no evidence that Roman surgeons successfully operated inside the body. Roman doctors
, and had only herbal antiseptics - so successful surgical operations would have been extremely difficult for them to perform.

486,1138,"Try to split problems of this type into a series of two-dimensional questions. It is easier to work in two dimensions than three. Look at the following example.
has a square base that is 4cm long. The height of the pyramid is 3cm.
O is the centre of the base, so AQ is half of AC.
are equilateral triangles with sides that are 4cm long.
QU is part of the triangle QUV, where V is the point we used in the first part of this question, midway between S and R.
For this question, you will need to use the answers from the previous questions. Use the perpendicular height of the prism, UV, which is
and the base is 18.8 (1 dp).
Keep your answers in surd form (like
), or store them in the memory of your calculator. Using rounded values later on in a question will lead to inaccurate answers.
You might also be expected to apply the sine or cosine rules to a 3-D problem. Look at the following example.
Sally and Kate stand some distance away from a building (B) which is 10m high. Sally is on a bearing of 030 from the building. From where she is standing, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 35. Kate is on a bearing of 090 from the building. From where she is standing, the angle of elevation of the top of the building is 50. This information is shown in the diagram.
What is the distance between Sally and Kate?
In the same way we can find OK = 8.39m (3 s.f.)

489,5266,"A lot of everyday items are made from polymers. Many of these polymers are not biodegradable - microbes cannot digest them and they take a long time to break down. Polymers are usually disposed of by burying them in landfill sites or burning them in incinerators. These methods of disposal cause environmental problems, and waste valuable resources.
The properties of polymers depend on the structure and bonding found in their molecules. Smart materials such as Gore-Tex have more useful properties than other polymers.
Polymers are large molecules formed from many identical smaller molecules (monomers).
. Addition polymers are formed from alkenes. For example:
ethene can polymerise to form polyethene, which is also called polythene
a typical use of polythene is for a plastic shopping bag or plastic bottle
a typical use of polystyrene is for insulation and protective packaging
Some polymers are not made from alkene monomers. These are called condensation polymers. Nylon and polyesters are like this. They can be drawn into very fine fibres and woven into cloth for clothing. Often, natural fibres such as cotton are mixed with nylon or polyester fibres to make a soft but hard-wearing cloth.
One of the useful properties of polymers is that they are unreactive, so they are suitable for storing food and chemicals safely. Unfortunately, this property makes it difficult to dispose of polymers. They are often buried in landfill sites or incinerated - burned.
Waste polymers are disposed of in landfill sites. This uses up valuable land, and suitable sites often fill up quickly.
Polymers release a lot of heat energy when they burn. This energy can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. But there are problems with incineration. Carbon dioxide is produced, which adds to global warming. Toxic gases are also produced, unless the polymers are incinerated at high temperatures.
Polymers have recycling symbols like this one for PVC to show what they are
Many polymers can be recycled. This reduces disposal problems and the amount of crude oil used. But first the different polymers must be separated from each other. This can be difficult and expensive.
Most polymers, including poly(ethene) and poly(propene), are not biodegradable. This means microorganisms cannot break them down, so they may last for many years in rubbish dumps. However, it is possible to include chemicals that cause the polymer to break down more quickly. Carrier bags and refuse bags made from degradable polymers are already available.
Nylon has some desirable properties. It does not let ultraviolet light pass through it, and it is:
Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.
Gore-Tex fabric is a sandwich of materials
Structure and properties of polymers - higher
Strong covalent bonds join atoms to each other in individual polymer molecules. Weak intermolecular forces attract polymer molecules towards each other. The properties of solid materials like polymers depend on:
the strength of the forces between these molecules
A polymer will melt when the intermolecular forces are overcome. The stronger the forces, the more energy is needed to break them, and the higher the materials melting point.
Many polymers, such as poly(ethene), contain long molecules that lie side by side. These can uncoil and slide past each other, making the material flexible. Long polymer chains have stronger forces of attraction than shorter ones: they make stronger materials.
Cross-linking is where the polymer chains are chemically joined together in places, by covalent bonds. The polymer molecules cannot slide over each other so easily. This makes materials tougher and less flexible, and they cannot be easily stretched. Cross-linking also gives materials high melting points.
Vulcanised rubber has cross-links. Its polymer molecules are cross-linked by sulfur atoms. It is tough but flexible, and used for making tyres.

Ich wohne seit vierzehn Jahren in Herborn. Ich fahre oft nach Gieen, aber ich bin immer froh, wenn ich von der Uni wieder nach Hause fahren kann. Es gibt zwar nicht sehr viel zu tun, aber das macht mir nichts aus. Ich brauche nur meine Freunde anzurufen und in zehn Minuten sitzen wir zusammen in einer der vielen Kneipen in der Altstadt und reden miteinander. Und nachher kann ich einfach nach Hause laufen.
Ich wohne in einer Wohnung in Offenburg, etwa fnf Gehminuten vom Bahnhof. Es gefllt mir dort, denn ich kann morgens im Stadtpark joggen. Ich habe daran gedacht, nach Freiburg zu ziehen, weil es dort viel mehr zu tun gibt, besonders was Sport betrifft. Aber da so viele Leute dort studieren wollen, sind die Lebenskosten viel hher und ich muss ein paar Jahre warten, bis ich dahinziehen kann.
Ich wohne immer noch bei meinen Eltern in Spiesen-Elversberg. Das liegt am Waldrand, etwa fnf Kilometer sdlich von Neunkirchen. Es ist ganz schn ruhig hier und man kann sich gut vom Schulstress erholen, aber abends und am Wochenende wird es mir langweilig. Meine Eltern sind super und fahren mich nach Neunkirchen zum Kino und holen mich oft sehr spt ab. Ich freue mich schon auf nchstes Jahr. Bis dann habe ich hoffentlich meinen Fhrerschein. Dann htte ich vor allem in Saarbrcken eine grere Auswahl an Filmen.
Seit fnf Jahren wohne ich auf dem Lande. Frher habe ich in Berlin gewohnt. Klar hat das Spa gemacht, in einer Weltstadt zu wohnen. Aber ich denke jetzt nie daran und auf dem Bauernhof habe ich alles, was ich brauche. Das geht allerdings nicht ohne Wagen und Telefon, denn hier gibt es so gut wie keine ffentlichen Verkehrsmittel.
Wer ist das? Schreiben Sie den Namen, der am besten passt.
Eva finds it restful at home after school.
Living costs are too high in Freiburg for Michael to move there.
Lars moved from Berlin five years ago.

Sometimes the instructions on the reading exam are in English - but be careful,they may not be as straightforward as they seem!
Read each situation carefully and think about what you actually need to know.
Read every choice all the way through. There might be a word or part of a word that you recognise.
Don't jump to conclusions! Sometimes a word like 'Oficina' can be used in a way that it isn't in English.
Don't panic if you don't know what a word means. Look through all the choices and eliminate the ones you know aren't the right answer.
Be careful! Sometimes the question tries to mislead you by offering you information you don't need.

Points can be converted into vouchers that provide discounts on products or services.
Each customers' loyalty card has a unique card number linked to a

which stores information about them (provided by the customer when they signed up) and their purchases.

When a customer signs up they provide basic details such as their name and address.
Loyalty cards provide companies with information about customer spending habits. This information can be used to target customers generally or specifically.
If customers frequently buy bread and milk together, these items may be put nearby each other for customer convenience or, farther apart forcing the customer to walk through the entire store (in the hope they buy additional items along their way).
If a customer frequently buys beans, vouchers offering money off beans will be sent to them (further increasing their loyalty), rather than for products they rarely buy.

When customers sign-up they provide their address. This information can be used to see where the customers come from and identify opportunities for new stores.

Unfortunately, nylon does not let water vapour pass through it either. This means nylon waterproof clothing traps sweat, so that after a while the inside of the clothing becomes wet, making it unpleasant to wear.
Gore-Tex has the desirable properties of nylon, but is also 'breathable'. It lets water vapour from sweat pass to the outside, but it stops rain drops from passing to the inside. Clothing made of Gore-Tex is very useful to hikers and other people who work or play outside.
Teflon is the trade name for a polymer called polytetrafluoroethene, or PTFE. It is very slippery, so is used to make non-stick coatings for pans. It is also used in Gore-Tex.
Gore-Tex contains layers of nylon, PTFE and polyurethane. The PTFE contains a lot of tiny holes called pores - there are around 14 million per square millimetre. Each one is too small for water droplets to pass through, but big enough to let water molecules from sweat go through. Without the nylon, the layers would be too fragile to be useful.

499,3877,"Owen's anti-war sentiments contrast starkly with the work of other poets.
Owen makes clear to the reader that he is unconvinced by the rhetoric of previous poets who have declared the glory of dying in war. Poems such as Tennyson's
offer a final message of glory and bravery, with sacrifice for one's country a noble and desirable end. Wilfred Owen's poem
rejects 'The old Lie'. Owen experienced war, and so his poems are more closely reflective of the views of the serving soldiers.

501,3255,"Exam questions on data security will usually ask about methods for keeping data safe and secure.
In a local doctor's surgery, data about the patients is stored in a database on a computer.
Consider two physical precautions that should be taken to keep the data secure.
- the question is asking for the physical precautions you can take to protect data. Keeping the computer area secure and keeping backups in a safe place are both physical precautions. Swipe card entry, locking
a point of access, eg to a computer system
or controlling access to computer areas would also have been good answers.
The doctor needs to see all the information about patients. The receptionist only needs to see some of the information.
Describe one way in which software could restrict access to patient information.
Make it so users must enter a password to gain access to certain areas of the database.
The question is looking for detail about different types of access for different users. This answer clearly highlights the need for having passwords for different levels of access.

504,1028,"A storyboard shows each stage you want to have on screen, one after the other. You would normally use a storyboard if there is just a single pathway through your product  for example, a simple slideshow that starts at Slide 1 and goes through to the end.
You can include pictures, text and descriptions to explain what you are trying to achieve. For example, you might want to describe some sound or music that you want to have, or the transition you would like to have between slides.
Below is an example of a storyboard for a School Parents' Evening presentation.
The more detail you include, the easier you will find it when you come to make the actual product.
Your finished version does not have to be exactly the same as your original design:
Sometimes you will find better ways of doing something. For example, you may not be able to find the precise image you intended to use.
Don't worry about changes. The storyboard is just a plan to guide you through the process. You will not lose marks for changes.
Use your evaluation section to explain the differences between the storyboard plan and final version. Don't forget to include reasons why changes were made.

505,2234,"All animals and plants are made of cells. Animal cells and plant cells have features in common, such as a nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria and ribosomes. Plant cells also have a cell wall, and often have chloroplasts and a permanent vacuole. Note that cells may be specialised to carry out a particular function.
Dissolved substances pass into and out of cells by diffusion. Water passes into and out of cells by osmosis.
Function of cells which animal and plant cells have in common
contains genetic material, which controls the activities of the cell
most chemical processes take place here, controlled by enzymes
controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell
most energy is released by respiration here
contain chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis
filled with cell sap to help keep the cell

There are many types of adhesives to suit different materials. When you are choosing the right one for your product you will have to take into consideration the type of material, the strength of the bond required and the environment the product will work in - for example if you are gluing timber for outdoor use, you would not use polyvinyl acetate (PVA), because it is water soluble.
will join almost anything to anything. It is widely used in industry, for example, many parts of aircraft are held together with double-sided tape!
Joining wood 1: screws, nails, glues and knock-downs
There are many different ways of making joints in wood. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength required and the quality of the product. Temporary fixings will often be done using fastening components such screws or bolts. More permanent joints can be achieved with glue, or with nails - though these may lack strength and be rough-and-ready in appearance.

of the screw - so that the core fits tightly into it.
Screws come with different types of head. They can be flat or round-headed, and be fitted with a slot (for traditional screwdrivers), crosses (for Phillips or Posidrive screwdrivers) or square holes (for square drivers). If the screw head is to lie flush with the surface of the wood, the hole must be enlarged or
are made from very hard steel. They have a thread which goes all the way up to the head, and cut an internal thread as they are screwed in. They can be used in metal and plastic as well as wood. Machine screws are used for joining metal and plastic components.
Nails come in different shapes and sizes. Nails are much cheaper than screws and quick to put in. You do not need to drill holes in the wood first, except sometimes when using hard wood or to prevent the wood splitting.
When using wood glue, make sure you:
Get the surfaces to be glued to fit well - no gaps!
Don't put any finish on the surfaces to be glued.
Get everything ready before you start - glue, brush, damp cloth, clamps and blocks to protect your work.
Don't start to glue up unless you are sure you have enough time - you can't stop half way through!

As with wood, there are many ways of joining metal permanently. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength needed and the quality of the product.
Brazing is a way of bonding materials (usually metals) by melting a filler metal or alloy between the components you want to join. The filler metals used in brazing usually have melting points between 450C and 1000C, but must have a lower melting point than the material being joined. Brazing forms very strong, permanent joints.

The solder flows into the heated metal along the joint, distributes itself by capillary action, and grips the two pieces together when it all cools.

Welding is different from soldering in that the two pieces of metal are themselves melted along the joints, fusing together as they cool. In

How does the relationship between Eddie and Catherine change during the first act of the play? Give reasons for your answer.
Explain the background to the relationship and show what the relationship is like at the start of the play.
Para 2 - The relationship at the start of the play
Discuss Eddie's reaction to Catherine's new skirt and her new job, and what this shows about his feelings for her.
You could also mention Beatrice's view of the relationship at his point - she gives us the first hints that Eddie is over-protective.
Para 3 - Impact of Rodolpho's arrival
Discuss how the arrival of Rodolpho immediately changes the state of Eddie's feelings for Catherine. As she becomes more attracted to Rodolpho, Eddie becomes more desperate to prevent his rival taking Catherine away from him.
Para 4 - Contrast Eddie's and Catherine's feelings for each other
Comment on the difference between Catherine's innocent fondness for Eddie and his shameful love for her. Give examples to show how we know what each of them is feeling.
You could also mention Alfieri's view of Eddie's love and how Alfieri understands it was impossible for Eddie to control.
Para 5 - Fight at end of Act I
Examine the fight at the end of Act I when Catherine makes it clear that she loves Rodolpho more than Eddie. How does this prepare us for Act II?
Look forward to what will happen in Act II. Briefly summarise how what we have learnt about the relationship so far prepares us for the fatal ending.

508,2621,"In the exam, you will be required to write about several poems, some pre-1914 and some post-1914. To which poems would you compare
? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of ones which we have not!
What to look for in your comparison
Both poems look at the power the older generation have over the younger but 'We Remember' is from the older generation's point of view, Kid from that of the younger generation.
Robin in Kid has broken free from Batman and now has the upper hand; the child in the Duffy poem still feels downtrodden.
A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen.
between generations, both from the point of view of the older generation.
The young people in the Yeats poem seem to have a pleasant time of it; the child in We Remember seems very unhappy.
Both poems about the distance between parent and child, both from the point of view of the older generation.
Margaret's love for her child is clearly genuine - the parents 'love' in the Duffy poem rings hollow.

510,4707,"Think about this question: Why did the automobile industry have such a big impact on the growth of the American economy?
Now draw a diagram with a Model T Ford at the centre. Use arrows coming from the diagram to show how cars needed other materials such as glass and rubber and so these other industries would also start to grow. Then add other ideas to to your diagram to show the growth of things like roads, hotels and holiday resorts. Finally, add pictures to your diagram to show how Ford's ideas could have been used in other industries. Remember the production line and conveyor belt!
As part of your revision, think about the

production the designer is frequently the maker as well. The client is usually the end-user of the product, and will have high expectations about the quality of the product. The designer will nearly always have a direct relationship with the client, so it is essential that the designer is fully conversant with the end-user's requirements.
production method for making a small quantity (between two and about 100) identical products.
production the process of designing is more formalised, but the number of people involved may still be quite small. The client may be the user, but is more likely to be another company who sell the product. The designer will not necessarily have any contact with the end-user of the product.
production method for making hundreds of identical products, usually on a production line. Also called repetitive flow production.
production method for making many thousands of identical products. The difference between this and mass production is that the production line is kept running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
flow production the processes of designing and manufacturing are much more formal. Making of changes can become slower. There is little or no contact between the designer and the client. The designer is therefore dependent on other people feeding back the end-users' views.

Pip is both the hero and narrator of the story, looking back reflectively on the lessons life has taught him. He is critical of the mistakes made by his younger self.
Dickens starts with Pip weeping for his dead family in the churchyard, establishing him as an orphan for whom we feel sorry and protective.
Pip is a good person. He steals a file and food for the convict, but feels guilty about it. He helps Herbert Pocket to get a job. He helps Magwitch, even though it means the end of his dreams of being a gentleman.
Pip's efforts to be a gentleman almost destroy him - he says horrible things to Biddy and is ashamed of Joe. But he maintains our sympathy because he hates himself for it.
Pip's 'training' to be a gentleman was merely learning to eat properly and wear the 'right' clothes - showing that at the time he mistakenly thought that being a 'gentleman' was about surface wealth and manners (when really it was about inner character and worth).
Two things 'save' Pip. Firstly, luck dashes his dreams. Secondly, those who love him stick by him.
In the end, Pip finds happiness in hard work, 'sufficient' income, and doing the decent thing. Pip is an autobiographical projection of Dickens himself. By 1860, Dickens' marriage had failed, and he had worries about his children, and his business. In
he tells us the conclusions of an older, wiser man with experience of setbacks - that happiness is not about being successful, but being good.
In the novel, Magwitch is a father-figure to Pip. (Remember that Dickens' own father was imprisoned.)
Although Magwitch is a convict and 'a fearful man', he is decent enough to take the blame for Pip's theft (which in those days was a hanging offence). This reflects the novel's theme that a real gentleman is not someone who has money and manners, but someone who does good.
In the churchyard where Pip begins his recollections, Magwitch - also an orphan - is first made 'aware of himself' stealing food. It is suggested to us that his poor start in life condemned him to a life as a criminal.
Because Magwitch is a criminal, Pip feels he cannot keep his money, so Magwitch's return means the end of Pip's fortune.
Although he is horrified to meet him at first, Pip comes to love Magwitch as a good and noble man. In the end, he brings the dying Magwitch happiness by telling him Estella is his daughter and that he (Pip) loves her.
Magwitch's story carries the social message of
: that poverty creates crime, and many criminals are decent people who are just unlucky.
is as much Magwitch's story as it is Pip's.
Miss Havisham is a mother-figure to Pip, but taunts and abuses him. (Remember that Dickens disliked his own mother.)
Miss Havisham is a purposefully 'unreal' character. Time has stood still for her: she wears fantastic clothing and looks like a waxwork. Many writers describe
as a 'fairy story', in which Miss Havisham plays the part of Pip's imperfect fairy god-mother.
Miss Havisham also supplies the 'silver fork' element of the novel - stories about rich people that fascinated the poor.
Miss Havisham is a connecting thread for the storyline:
She was swindled by Compeyson, which condemned his partner, Magwitch, to jail.
She adopted Magwitch's daughter, Estella, but encouraged her to break Pip's heart.
Her employment of Pip gives him his yearning to be a gentleman. But she pays for Pip to be apprenticed to a blacksmith, which is the cause of his dissatisfaction.
It is at Satis House that Pip first meets Jaggers, and it is this which leads him to guess, wrongly, that Miss Havisham is his secret
Someone that helps or supports a person or group, usually by offering financial aid.
In Chapter 38, Estella rejects not only Pip's love but also Miss Havisham's, and breaks both of their hearts.
At the end of the novel, Miss Havisham sees she has hurt Pip because she was hurt, and seeks his forgiveness.
In the end, Miss Havisham is consumed by fire (a Christian image of cleansing, as well as punishment).
Although she harms Pip, the reader forgives her because she is clearly psychologically damaged, repents of her actions and dies such a horrific death.
Her name means 'star' - which is associated with beauty and love, yet at the same time is cold, distant and unobtainable. Pip, in his desire to be a gentleman, is 'reaching for the stars', but doomed to fall short.
Perhaps Dickens associated Estella with his teenage, starlet lover Ellen Ternan (the 'ell' of Ellen is picked up in the name Estella). Did this give special vibrancy to his descriptions of Pip's yearning love?
Estella is beautiful and rich, but these are her only qualities. She is otherwise shallow and cruel.
Biddy is the opposite to Estella, who represents the shallowness of money and manners.
tells of how Pip is at first beguiled into wanting Estella, but discovers that Biddy is better.
The reader can forgive Estella because, like Miss Havisham (who trained her to hate men), she too is psychologically damaged. Also, she warns Pip from the start that she has a cold heart and will never love him. Pip's
In the final chapter, after Estella's unhappy marriage to the brutal Bentley Drummle, she tells Pip she has learned good character: ""I have been bent and broken but - I hope - into a better shape.""
On the advice of friends, and to make the book more popular, Dickens rewrote the ending to read: ""'I saw no shadow of another parting from her"" - allowing Pip and Estella to stay together.
Orlick is the irredeemably evil element in
- giving it a Gothic atmosphere of threat and foreboding.
Orlick's favourite phrases are: ""I'll be burned"" and ""I'll be jiggered (meaning 'caught on a sharp hook')"" - conjuring up violent and frightening images.
After Joe (who represents pure good) defeats Orlick in a fair fight, Orlick later creeps back and attacks Mrs Joe from behind (a cowardly and brutal act).
Orlick earns Pip's disgust when he 'dances at' (that is, makes eyes at) Biddy, which frightens her.
Throughout the story, Orlick resents and bullies Pip.
In Chapter 53, he lures Pip to the sluice-house, where he tries to kill him. This chapter is pure Victorian
A play or film characterised by exaggeratedly emotional or overdramatic scenes.
. Orlick - ""with a mouth snarling like a tiger's"" - has ceased to be a real person and become a fairytale 'villain'.
asserts that the middle-class virtues of cleanliness, kindness, hard work, temperance and gentleness make a true 'gentleman'. Some writers see Orlick as the middle-class fear of 'the masses' - dirty, cruel, lazy, drunken and violent.

by Estella, but discovers Biddy is a better choice.
is cold, ruthless and unfeeling. He washes his hands continually (like Pilate in the Bible) to try to cleanse himself of the bad things he is doing. Dickens' portrayal of Jaggers shows he saw being a lawyer as a dirty business.
demonstrates the lesson of the novel: that it is better to be friends with good people who want to be friends with you, than to idolise those who do not want to be your friend.

is a fairly two-dimensional 'bad person'. Jaggers calls him ""the Spider"". Dickens gave him the name 'Bentley' as revenge on a publisher who had cheated him.
represents the very worst in middle-class Victorian England: he is affected, opinionated and hypocritical.
loves the sound of his own voice and is hilariously ridiculous. He follows his dream as much as Pip, and ends up acting in a pantomime.
teaches Pip how to be a gentleman. His wife Belinda is pretty and should have married 'well', but is an incompetent housekeeper. In Chapters 22-23, Mrs Pocket and her two nurses, Flopson and Millers, introduce some slapstick comedy (mostly at the expense of the poor baby).
At the end of the novel, Pip persuades Miss Havisham to leave her money to the decent Matthew Pocket, rather than her other 'friends', who only want her money.
is Jaggers' clerk. His main comic feature is having a mouth like a letterbox, which grows wider when he is stressed. At work, he is severe and formal. At his home (which he has converted into a mock-castle), he is kind and generous, and his mouth relaxes.

are formed. Ions can be either positively or negatively charged.
For the Higher Tier, you need to know which ions are produced by acids, and which are produced by alkalis. You will also need to know the ionic equation for
Neutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base to form a salt plus water.
When acids dissolve in water they produce hydrogen ions, H
. For example, looking at hydrochloric acid:
Remember that (aq) means the substance is in solution.
When alkalis dissolve in water they produce hydroxide ions, OH
. For example, looking at sodium hydroxide:
Ammonia is slightly different. This is the equation for ammonia in solution:
ions from an acid react with the OH
ions from an alkali, a neutralisation reaction occurs to form water. This is the equation for the reaction:
If you look at the equations above for sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, you will see that there are Na

522,7121,"The alkali metals - trends in reactivity
As you go down the group, the atomic number of the alkali metals increases, and their properties change:
You will probably see lithium, sodium and potassium at school, but rubidium and caesium are considered to be too reactive to use in the classroom. Francium is radioactive and very rare - there are only a few grams of it in the whole of the Earth's crust at any time.
Reactions of lithium, sodium and potassium with water

523,1615,"is part of a line which has two end points (ie, it is not infinite). Each end of a line segment is usually labelled with letters.
If A is the point (1, 1) and B is the point (4, 5), what is the length of the line segment AB?
It is not easy to picture this without drawing a sketch. Have a look at the diagram below:
A has an x-coordinate of 1. B has an x-coordinate of 4. So, to get from A to B, we move along 3 units.
A has a y-coordinate of 1. B has a y-coordinate of 5. So, to get from A to B, we move up 4 units.
We have created a right-angled triangle. So to find the length of AB we use Pythagoras theorem.
If P is the point (1, 5) and Q is the point (5, 1), what is the length of the line segment PQ? Give your answer correct to 1 decimal point (d.p.).
If you get a question like this, it is fine to draw a sketch or diagram. If you get really confident, you might be able to answer the question without using a diagram.
If X is the point (1, 1) and Y is the point (3, 5), what is the midpoint of the line segment XY?
It is clear from this diagram that the midpoint of (1, 1) and (3, 5) is (2, 3).
In fact, the x-coordinate of M is the average of the x-coordinates of X and Y
And the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of X and Y.
What is the midpoint of (2, 7) and (4, 1)?
The midpoint of (2, 7) and (4, 1) is:

527,4208,"Theres no denying it, the sporting world has never been so illuminated under the media spotlight. Sporting events and sports personalities are bigger, brighter and more branded with big money sponsorship deals than ever before; just look at major events like the Premier Leagues Barclays Bank partnership. Then theres our perception of sport through the eyes of the media; what you read and see isnt always the truth and can often be affected by international politics. Today, many athletes are role models and celebrities in their own right. Well, who hasnt heard of David Beckham?
To support an event, activity or person by providing money or goods.
is a major feature of sport in the 21st century.
Most competitions have sponsors names included in their title:
Some sports stadia have sponsored names. For example:
Most clubs and teams have sponsors. For example:
is no longer legal. Sports Governing Bodies have to decide if proposed sponsorship, say junior sport by an alcohol brand, is acceptable.
It is always easier to get sponsorship if a sport or event receives media attention. High profile events gain greater amounts of sponsorship than those with no coverage.
There are pros and cons of sponsorship:
Increased publicity, status increased by being linked to success and glamour. Increased sales of their products
Negative events (drug use, cheating, crowd trouble) may affect your reputation
Free clothing and equipment or payment for wearing sponsor's clothing and using their equipment. Can concentrate on training without financial worries.
May be tied in to a contract including appearances at sponsors' events.
Financial support in addition to admission fees etc.
Dates, times, clothing may be changed to suit the sponsor.
a collective name for images, video and audio
coverage of sport is widespread. By listening to commentators, pundits and watching replays we improve our knowledge and understanding. Participation in sports covered by the media is always higher than for those that are not.
When watching sport on TV it is important to understand that the director of the programme will have an influence on what is seen and said. You should always analyse what you see and develop your own opinions about events.
Media coverage has many pros and cons:
Attendances may rise as people want to see the 'stars'
Gives viewers a close-up view of the action
Attendances may drop - more people watch from home
Some sports get lots of exposure, while others get none
Events can be sensationalised to promote the media (TV channel, newspaper etc), rather than the sport
Changes to playing season (eg rugby league)
Changes to the rules (eg badminton, volleyball rally-point rules, tennis tie-breaks)
NB Some of these may not been seen as disadvantages by those involved, but they do show the influence of the media.
The conduct of players, officials and spectators has an effect on the image of individual sports and the expectations of behaviour by those involved in them. Compare some examples of conduct in sports:
Golfers are expected to own up to anything they do wrong
- Players are expected to own up to anything that they do wrong and even disqualify themselves.
- Diving by players to get a free kick or penalty is increasing and almost everyone is complaining about it. But accepting the rewards when cheating benefits
- Opposition fans sit and stand together and there is usually a friendly atmosphere. Police presence and stewarding is light. Video surveillance is almost unheard of.
- Although most supporters enjoy the company of the opposition's fans, they are segregated to avoid outbreaks of violence by a minority. Groups of fans taunt each other with insults. Police presence and stewarding is very well organised. Video surveillance is used to identify troublemakers who are banned from future matches. All-seater stadia are required for all Premier League and international matches.
- The laws of the game penalise players for arguing with the referee although some acts of violence are dealt with as part of the game. Etiquette requires that the players always clap each other off the field and problems are left on the pitch.
- Players often surround the referee to argue with decisions. Acts of violence are often made worse by other players becoming involved and fans continuing to inflame the situation by booing players. Some disagreements on the pitch are continued and fights can break out in the tunnel after the game.
Do the fans encourage players to play well or behave badly? Or do the players incite the fans to celebrate or abuse each other?
Winners of major tournaments can earn large sums
A sportsperson who is not paid for taking part in sport.
. However, in demanding success many team owners and sponsors have encouraged players to become
A sportsperson who is paid to take part in sport.
. Tennis and rugby union are examples of sports that attempted to remain amateur but are now ' open' which means no distinction is made between amateurs and professionals. One of the reasons was the widespread abuse of hidden payments to amateurs following the worldwide increase in money for sport from the media.
Key differences between amateurs and professionals are:
Participation is more important than the result
Winning is the most important thing. The more they win, the more they earn
Political and financial issues that have affected international sports events
Despite the many advantages of hosting a major international event host nations must be prepared for difficulties. The Olympic Games has suffered from a number of different types of problem. These include:
Race issue: Black Power - 1968, Mexico City
Boycott by some nations - 1984, Los Angeles
For the exam you should know a little bit about each of these and you should keep up-to-date with events as they happen.
The 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies suffered problems relating to high ticket prices which prevented many locals from attending whilst matches were played in near empty stadiums. In addition the media coverage and police action surrounding the death of Pakistan coach, Bob Woolmer, took attention away from the matches.
The 2008 Beijing Olympics have generated lots of media intest and the 2012 London Olympics and future Football and Rugby World Cups will create many discussion points over the next few years.
The role of local and national sports providers
funded facilities are paid for by national and local government out of taxes and National Lottery funding. They can be found throughout the country.
They are available for everyone to use and are relatively cheap.
They include sports/leisure centres, swimming pools and outdoor pitches.
Some schools share facilities with the local authority for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
funded facilities are set up by private companies that try to make a profit. They are often members-only clubs. Members pay fees to join and use the facilities.
They are likely to be more expensive.
They include sports/fitness clubs, golf and tennis clubs.
Some schools pay to use private sports clubs for lessons and extra-curricular activities.
Local authorities encourage participation in sport by employing sport development teams including School Sports Coordinators who arrange events, assist with coaching and develop links with clubs in the area of schools.

. As you have seen on the previous page, there is a link between an element's electronic structure and its place in the Periodic Table.
You can work out an element's electronic structure from its place in the Periodic Table
The diagram below shows a section of the Periodic Table, with the elements arranged as usual in order of their atomic number from 2 to 20. The red numbers above each chemical symbol show the electrons in each shell.
Electron arrangement for a section of the periodic table
the number of shells is the same as the period number.
As you go across each period from left to right the outer shell gradually becomes filled with electrons. The outer shell contains just one electron on the left hand side of the table, but is filled by the time you get to the right hand side.
the number of electrons in the outermost shell is the same as the group number.
Each element in a group therefore has the same number of electrons in its outer shell.
to this rule, since although it comes after Group 7 it is not called 'Group 8'; and it contains helium, which has only two electrons in its outer shell.
Working out electronic structure from the Periodic Table
Here's how to use the Periodic Table to work out an electronic structure:
Find the element in the Periodic Table. Work out which period it's in, and draw that number of circles around the nucleus.
Work out which group the element is in and draw that number of electrons in the outer circle - with eight for Group 0 elements (except helium).
Fill the other circles with electrons (remember: two in the first, eight in the second and third, 18 in the fourth).
Finally, count your electrons and check that they equal the atomic number.
Working out electronic structure from the atomic number
of an atom is the number of
it has. This is the same as the number of electrons. If we know the atomic number we can work out the arrangement of the electrons.
Fill the shells starting from the smallest and going outward.
For example silicon has atomic number 16. So we have to fill the shells with 16 electrons. That makes 2 in the first (to fill it), 8 in the second shell (to fill that) and 6 left to go into the third shell. So silicon has electronic structure 2.8.6

The fourth stanza contains one very long, sprawling sentence, broken over several line-ends: it's hard to grasp exactly what is being said, beyond the impressions of shadowy willows, murky water, and low-flying swans. This lends an obscure, dream-like feeling to the description.

- which is thought to be a major cause of global warming.
When fossil fuels are burnt - by industry, in power stations and in vehicles and planes - the gases enter the
The Earth's atmosphere is the envelope of gasses that surround the Earth. The gasses are held there by the Earth's gravity. The important gasses in the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide.
. Although these gases have always been present in the world's atmosphere, their concentration is gradually increasing as more and more fossil fuels are burnt.
Scientists believe that the build-up of these so-called
The main greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. They are naturally occurring in atmosphere, but are believed to have increased through burning more oil, petrol, and coal, while forests have been removed.
in the atmosphere acts like a blanket or greenhouse around the planet; heat is trapped inside the Earth's atmosphere. This is the
, and the resulting increase in global temperatures is called
It's thought that the build-up of greenhouse gases impacts on global temperature in two ways:
The gases allow more of the sun's rays to enter the atmosphere. Some
Energy from the sun - consisting of visible light, heat or infra-red radiation, ultra-violet and other forms of radiation.
is still reflected back into space by the outer parts of the atmosphere, but it's believed the amount reflected back is gradually reducing.
At the same time, the greenhouse gases absorb more of the solar radiation that is reflected back from the Earth's surface - trapping heat and keeping it in the atmosphere. The ability of the atmosphere to capture the sun's warmth is essential for life on earth. But if significantly MORE warmth is being captured, this is bad news for the planet.
Another group of greenhouse gases includes the
for short). CFCs have been responsible for depleting the
ozone layer as they attack and destroy ozone molecules.
The ozone layer is a high level layer of gas in the stratosphere. The ozone helps to keep out harmful ultra-violet rays, which cause sunburn on human skin and damage plants.
The resulting ozone holes let harmful ultra-violet radiation in and add to the greenhouse effect.
CFCs can be used in aerosols, such as hairspray cans, fridges and in making foam plastics.
CFCs were banned in many countries in the mid-1990s after it was found that they were breaking up the Earth's ozone.

537,1598,"If you are mainly painting and drawing, you'll be expected to develop your knowledge and understanding of colour, form, tone, texture and shape.
You'll need to explore the results of painting on different surfaces, the qualities of different paints, and the effects of using different painting tools. For example, acrylic paint can be used to create flat surfaces of colour but if it's watered down sufficiently, it can be used to create washes of colour.

What is each painting about? What is each artist trying to represent or say?
How does the subject matter differ between the two paintings?
How has each artist used paint to show how they feel about their subject matter?
How have time and/or place influenced each artist?
Does it look like the artist has used a brush or palette knife to apply the paint?
Does the way in which each artist has used the paint affect the mood, atmosphere or the way it looks?
Does the size of either of the paintings affect the viewer?
What (painting) devices does Justin Mortimer use to show Mick Scarletts personality. How does he show his response to and feelings about him?
How does Robert Maclaurin show that the atmosphere and mood of a place is more important to him than the accurate recording of its details?

experiment with thick and thin areas to create textures
surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more
and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too.
Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring.
Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based.
experiment with the surface you are painting on
. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way.
Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed
. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more.
Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be.
Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures.
Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint.

, such as different thicknesses, types and textures of paper. Experiment to see the difference it makes what type of marks you use to draw the same subject. Try making marks that are all the same all over. Then try to get a wide range of different marks into the same drawing.
a collective name for images, video and audio
. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water.
Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind.

Emulsifiers help oil and water to mix - for example, in mayonnaise. Active packaging meanwhile improves the quality or safety of food.
Everything in food is made from chemicals. Some of these are natural, and some are artificial. Processed foods, including vegetable oils, may have chemicals added to them. These
have different roles, including extending a products shelf-life and improving its taste and appearance.
You can find additives listed on the ingredients label. Many have E numbers to identify them. The table below describes some of these:
orange colouring for soft drinks, sweets and sauces
allows oil and water to mix to make margarine, ice-cream and salad cream
Additives with an E number have been licensed by the European Union. Some are natural, some artificial. But they have all been safety tested and passed for use.
The UK Food Standards Agency - FSA - has strict limits on the amount of colouring allowed in food. Some people have allergic reactions to certain additives, and colourings are banned from baby food.
A red dye called 'Sudan I' was banned for use in food because it was thought to be a health risk. Some of the dye had been used in chilli powder before the ban came into force, and the dye was later added in this form to some foods by mistake. Hundreds of food items had to be taken off supermarket shelves and destroyed.
Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. They join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.
Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends:
a hydrophilic end - 'water-loving' - that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils; and
a hydrophobic end - 'water-hating' - that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.
Lecithin is an emulsifier commonly used in foods. It is obtained from oil seeds and is a mixture of different substances. A molecular model of one of these substances is seen in the diagram.
The hydrophilic 'head' dissolves in the water and the hydrophobic 'tail' dissolves in the oil. In this way, the water and oil droplets become unable to separate out. The mixture formed is called an emulsion.
Mayonnaise and emulsion paints are emulsions, but there are others - such as the two in the table.
bacteria and fungi grow on or in the food
chemical reactions take place in the food, such as fats reacting with oxygen to make rancid products
Modern packaging is designed to control or prevent reactions in food that make it go off. Such packaging includes:
cans that will cool down or heat up their contents
Ascorbic acid - vitamin C - is an antioxidant that is found naturally in foods such as citrus fruits, green peppers, green, leafy vegetables, such as cabbage, and potatoes. As E300, it may be added to food such as meat pies and salad cream.
Bacteria and fungi are living organisms. They need water and oxygen (as well as the food itself) to grow and reproduce. If one or both of these is taken away, the microbes are unable to survive and the food will last longer.
Active packaging improves the quality or safety of the food it contains.
Oxygen can be restricted by packaging the food in plastic, or sealing it in an air-tight container. However, the food itself contains some oxygen, and microbes can still survive in it. The air in modern packaging is often replaced by gases such as nitrogen. This restricts the amount of oxygen available so that microbes cannot grow and reproduce.
There are other benefits to this method:
fats in the food cannot react with oxygen to produce substances with rancid smells and flavours
substances in sliced fruit and vegetables cannot oxidise and turn the food brown
crisps and other easily damaged foods are protected from being crushed
Water can be removed by drying the food. Modern freeze-drying methods allow many food items to be dried so that they last longer. Freeze drying is popular for instant drinks, packet soups and fruit pieces in breakfast cereals.

540,1263,"Despite some MEDCs having food surpluses and problems such as obesity, many people in LEDCs suffer from malnutrition and starvation. This could be a result of factors such as drought, debt or conflict, eg in the Darfur region of Sudan.
This is an example of 'sustainable agriculture'. It benefits small farmers and enables them to use their land efficiently. The projects use cheap, appropriate technology to increase yields in ways that make farmers more independent and conserve their natural resources.
Farmers in 50 developing countries have adopted sustainable techniques and some have experienced increased yields. By combining science with traditional knowledge, sustainable agriculture could meet the long-term food needs of developing countries without damaging the environment.
Genetically modified (GM) foods, for example, could change food production methods. They allow more food to be produced in a smaller area using fewer resources. Some people are against GM crops and question whether it will reduce hunger in LEDCs and are concerned about the impact on the environment.
In the 1960s high-yielding varieties of crops were used to increase food production - this became known as 'The Gene Revolution'. In the Gene Revolution, genes from one plant were copied and inserted into another to give it new characteristics. This allowed foods to be developed to suit specific environments and food demands.

). You should revise a small number of new words and phrases every day.
As well as topic-based vocabulary you must be sure that you are confident with your general vocabulary that can be applied to all sorts of situations, for example:
You also need to learn the phrases that keep turning up in role plays, for example:
'j'aime', 'je n'aime pas' 'est-ce que je peux...?' 'est-ce qu'il y a...?' 'je voudrais...' 'tu veux / vous voulez...?' 'c'est combien?' 'pour aller...?'

Diabetes  risk and benefit (Ideas about science)
Weighing up the consequences - higher only
Everyone has to make choices about whether to accept the risks associated with some activities. We accept risk every day. Crossing a busy street involves a risk of being knocked over by a car. We accept this risk because we know that this event is very unlikely to happen. But we also know that if it did happen the result could be very serious.
To decide whether we should accept a risk, we need to consider:
what is the chance of the event occurring
what are the consequences to us if the event does occur
With reference to diabetes, each person must make a decision about the diet they eat based on:
the chance of their getting diabetes if they eat poorly or are obese

In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work.

My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity.
I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria.
After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria.
I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme.
I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture.
The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use.
My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.

548,5727,"The poem is about the experience of crossing Westminster Bridge early in the morning and seeing the calmness and beauty of the city of London. The poem describes the city in a very positive way, communicating its power and 'splendour'.
Wordsworth suggests that the view of the city is a rival for anything naturally occurring: 'Earth has not anything to show more fair' is the opening line.
The use of the word 'smokeless' in line 8 gives the reader a clue about why this scene is so powerful. Under normal circumstances, the smoke from homes and factories would have obscured the view of the city; it is as if the speaker is experiencing the true beauty of the city for the first time.
